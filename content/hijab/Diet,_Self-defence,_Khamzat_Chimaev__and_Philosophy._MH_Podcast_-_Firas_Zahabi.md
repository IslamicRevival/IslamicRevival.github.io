[0:02:09](https://youtu.be/v4-FUP5Nefk?t=129) to be  
[0:02:10](https://youtu.be/v4-FUP5Nefk?t=130) said to the public  
[0:02:11](https://youtu.be/v4-FUP5Nefk?t=131) now  
[0:02:12](https://youtu.be/v4-FUP5Nefk?t=132) a lot of us nowadays we we have so many  
[0:02:15](https://youtu.be/v4-FUP5Nefk?t=135) diet plans to choose from  
[0:02:17](https://youtu.be/v4-FUP5Nefk?t=137) we've got the carnivorous diet we have  
[0:02:19](https://youtu.be/v4-FUP5Nefk?t=139) the ketogenic diet we have uh vegan  
[0:02:22](https://youtu.be/v4-FUP5Nefk?t=142) vegan diet uh you know we have calorie  
[0:02:24](https://youtu.be/v4-FUP5Nefk?t=144) deficit we have you know fat fat deficit  
[0:02:27](https://youtu.be/v4-FUP5Nefk?t=147) so many deficits so many different diets  
[0:02:30](https://youtu.be/v4-FUP5Nefk?t=150) uh it's intermittent fasting has become  
[0:02:32](https://youtu.be/v4-FUP5Nefk?t=152) really big there's so many different  
[0:02:34](https://youtu.be/v4-FUP5Nefk?t=154) youtubers now that are on the scene that  
[0:02:36](https://youtu.be/v4-FUP5Nefk?t=156) given their own diet plans  
[0:02:38](https://youtu.be/v4-FUP5Nefk?t=158) this is becoming so confusing now mm-hmm  
[0:02:41](https://youtu.be/v4-FUP5Nefk?t=161) honestly it's i'm speaking from  
[0:02:43](https://youtu.be/v4-FUP5Nefk?t=163) experience when you it's almost as if  
[0:02:46](https://youtu.be/v4-FUP5Nefk?t=166) now there's competing schools of thought  
[0:02:48](https://youtu.be/v4-FUP5Nefk?t=168) you have the keto school of thought  
[0:02:49](https://youtu.be/v4-FUP5Nefk?t=169) where everything keto is good you know  
[0:02:52](https://youtu.be/v4-FUP5Nefk?t=172) and you have people that you know the  
[0:02:53](https://youtu.be/v4-FUP5Nefk?t=173) solution  
[0:02:54](https://youtu.be/v4-FUP5Nefk?t=174) to everything is ketogenic diet and  
[0:02:56](https://youtu.be/v4-FUP5Nefk?t=176) intermittent fasting and then you have  
[0:02:57](https://youtu.be/v4-FUP5Nefk?t=177) other people that say no actually no  
[0:02:59](https://youtu.be/v4-FUP5Nefk?t=179) this is nonsense let's go the opposite  
[0:03:00](https://youtu.be/v4-FUP5Nefk?t=180) way  
[0:03:01](https://youtu.be/v4-FUP5Nefk?t=181) or the carnivorous diet which is quite  
[0:03:03](https://youtu.be/v4-FUP5Nefk?t=183) close to quito  
[0:03:05](https://youtu.be/v4-FUP5Nefk?t=185) what do we do  
[0:03:07](https://youtu.be/v4-FUP5Nefk?t=187) i would say i love uh there's a paul  
[0:03:08](https://youtu.be/v4-FUP5Nefk?t=188) check quote that i absolutely love he  
[0:03:10](https://youtu.be/v4-FUP5Nefk?t=190) says look we're as different on the  
[0:03:11](https://youtu.be/v4-FUP5Nefk?t=191) inside as we are on the outside it's  
[0:03:13](https://youtu.be/v4-FUP5Nefk?t=193) such an important quote because it's  
[0:03:14](https://youtu.be/v4-FUP5Nefk?t=194) true look at the differences we have on  
[0:03:15](https://youtu.be/v4-FUP5Nefk?t=195) the outside you're not everybody's gonna  
[0:03:18](https://youtu.be/v4-FUP5Nefk?t=198) react the same way to the same diet  
[0:03:21](https://youtu.be/v4-FUP5Nefk?t=201) so there's some exploration now i i  
[0:03:23](https://youtu.be/v4-FUP5Nefk?t=203) personally think that  
[0:03:25](https://youtu.be/v4-FUP5Nefk?t=205) you should  
[0:03:26](https://youtu.be/v4-FUP5Nefk?t=206) try to choose a diet that you can live  
[0:03:27](https://youtu.be/v4-FUP5Nefk?t=207) with for the rest of your life  
[0:03:30](https://youtu.be/v4-FUP5Nefk?t=210) so if me personally i can't do keto i  
[0:03:32](https://youtu.be/v4-FUP5Nefk?t=212) can do keto for a little while then i  
[0:03:34](https://youtu.be/v4-FUP5Nefk?t=214) get bored of it i want to eat  
[0:03:35](https://youtu.be/v4-FUP5Nefk?t=215) carbohydrates i have i'm drawn to  
[0:03:36](https://youtu.be/v4-FUP5Nefk?t=216) carbohydrates i love carbohydrates  
[0:03:39](https://youtu.be/v4-FUP5Nefk?t=219) so my diet is is mostly high carb low  
[0:03:42](https://youtu.be/v4-FUP5Nefk?t=222) fat  
[0:03:43](https://youtu.be/v4-FUP5Nefk?t=223) really yeah i'm more high carb low fat i  
[0:03:45](https://youtu.be/v4-FUP5Nefk?t=225) perform better i've experimented with  
[0:03:47](https://youtu.be/v4-FUP5Nefk?t=227) different diets i'm more comfortable  
[0:03:49](https://youtu.be/v4-FUP5Nefk?t=229) with why does protein fit into that five  
[0:03:51](https://youtu.be/v4-FUP5Nefk?t=231) cell um i have i have proteins but if i  
[0:03:53](https://youtu.be/v4-FUP5Nefk?t=233) want to lean up i go more towards egg  
[0:03:55](https://youtu.be/v4-FUP5Nefk?t=235) whites egg whites are high protein low  
[0:03:57](https://youtu.be/v4-FUP5Nefk?t=237) fat so i want a low fat source chicken  
[0:03:59](https://youtu.be/v4-FUP5Nefk?t=239) breast a low fat source of  
[0:04:01](https://youtu.be/v4-FUP5Nefk?t=241) uh  
[0:04:03](https://youtu.be/v4-FUP5Nefk?t=243) flesh foods proteins so as a percentage  
[0:04:05](https://youtu.be/v4-FUP5Nefk?t=245) let's just kind of give this a visual if  
[0:04:07](https://youtu.be/v4-FUP5Nefk?t=247) a hundred percent is you've got carbs i  
[0:04:09](https://youtu.be/v4-FUP5Nefk?t=249) mean this is simplistic but you've got

[0:04:14](https://youtu.be/v4-FUP5Nefk?t=254) what kind of percentage are we looking  
[0:04:15](https://youtu.be/v4-FUP5Nefk?t=255) at here i would say 70 percent is carbs  
[0:04:18](https://youtu.be/v4-FUP5Nefk?t=258) i eat a lot but i train a lot if you  
[0:04:20](https://youtu.be/v4-FUP5Nefk?t=260) train less you don't need that many  
[0:04:21](https://youtu.be/v4-FUP5Nefk?t=261) carbs now these keto guys i think this

[0:04:27](https://youtu.be/v4-FUP5Nefk?t=267) don't forget i'm in a glycogenic sport  
[0:04:29](https://youtu.be/v4-FUP5Nefk?t=269) that means i need i primarily use  
[0:04:31](https://youtu.be/v4-FUP5Nefk?t=271) carbohydrates  
[0:04:32](https://youtu.be/v4-FUP5Nefk?t=272) for fuel right okay so it's normal if  
[0:04:34](https://youtu.be/v4-FUP5Nefk?t=274) i'm gonna wake up in the morning and go  
[0:04:35](https://youtu.be/v4-FUP5Nefk?t=275) wrestle and i'm gonna go at night  
[0:04:37](https://youtu.be/v4-FUP5Nefk?t=277) wrestle again you need a lot of  
[0:04:38](https://youtu.be/v4-FUP5Nefk?t=278) carbohydrates yes you don't need so much  
[0:04:40](https://youtu.be/v4-FUP5Nefk?t=280) carbohydrates if you're just working  
[0:04:42](https://youtu.be/v4-FUP5Nefk?t=282) behind the desk i would tell you get  
[0:04:43](https://youtu.be/v4-FUP5Nefk?t=283) your carbs from greens eat more greens  
[0:04:45](https://youtu.be/v4-FUP5Nefk?t=285) when i say carbs i mean starches and  
[0:04:47](https://youtu.be/v4-FUP5Nefk?t=287) keto ketones are not a substitute for  
[0:04:49](https://youtu.be/v4-FUP5Nefk?t=289) carbohydrates you're saying no not at  
[0:04:51](https://youtu.be/v4-FUP5Nefk?t=291) all because ketones  
[0:04:53](https://youtu.be/v4-FUP5Nefk?t=293) see if your body wants to metabolize fat  
[0:04:55](https://youtu.be/v4-FUP5Nefk?t=295) for energy it takes longer there's a  
[0:04:57](https://youtu.be/v4-FUP5Nefk?t=297) longer process  
[0:04:58](https://youtu.be/v4-FUP5Nefk?t=298) so if you're wrestling and you want to  
[0:05:00](https://youtu.be/v4-FUP5Nefk?t=300) grab a guy and lift them up in the air  
[0:05:01](https://youtu.be/v4-FUP5Nefk?t=301) you need the energy now you need  
[0:05:02](https://youtu.be/v4-FUP5Nefk?t=302) glycogen in your muscle the glycogen in  
[0:05:04](https://youtu.be/v4-FUP5Nefk?t=304) your muscle gets transformed to energy  
[0:05:06](https://youtu.be/v4-FUP5Nefk?t=306) immediately when the muscle contracts it  
[0:05:09](https://youtu.be/v4-FUP5Nefk?t=309) uses that that  
[0:05:11](https://youtu.be/v4-FUP5Nefk?t=311) that energy that's stored in the muscle  
[0:05:12](https://youtu.be/v4-FUP5Nefk?t=312) itself  
[0:05:13](https://youtu.be/v4-FUP5Nefk?t=313) if you're running a marathon if you're  
[0:05:15](https://youtu.be/v4-FUP5Nefk?t=315) doing aerobic work  
[0:05:17](https://youtu.be/v4-FUP5Nefk?t=317) it's lower intensity then your body can  
[0:05:20](https://youtu.be/v4-FUP5Nefk?t=320) use fats very successfully so you have  
[0:05:22](https://youtu.be/v4-FUP5Nefk?t=322) aerobic champions in aerobic sports that  
[0:05:24](https://youtu.be/v4-FUP5Nefk?t=324) only uh work on fats but there are no  
[0:05:26](https://youtu.be/v4-FUP5Nefk?t=326) sprinters 100-meter sprinters  
[0:05:28](https://youtu.be/v4-FUP5Nefk?t=328) high-intensity athletes that work only  
[0:05:30](https://youtu.be/v4-FUP5Nefk?t=330) on fats it doesn't exist  
[0:05:32](https://youtu.be/v4-FUP5Nefk?t=332) so what sport are you in this is very  
[0:05:34](https://youtu.be/v4-FUP5Nefk?t=334) important yeah you'll never see a guy  
[0:05:36](https://youtu.be/v4-FUP5Nefk?t=336) who's high fat low carb doesn't carb up  
[0:05:39](https://youtu.be/v4-FUP5Nefk?t=339) the day of the 100 meter race now  
[0:05:40](https://youtu.be/v4-FUP5Nefk?t=340) sometimes they do it  
[0:05:42](https://youtu.be/v4-FUP5Nefk?t=342) it's a bit complicated sometimes they go  
[0:05:44](https://youtu.be/v4-FUP5Nefk?t=344) on a short phase of ketogenic like mma  
[0:05:46](https://youtu.be/v4-FUP5Nefk?t=346) fighters will go on a ketogenic diet low  
[0:05:48](https://youtu.be/v4-FUP5Nefk?t=348) carb diet just to drop the water  
[0:05:50](https://youtu.be/v4-FUP5Nefk?t=350) because  
[0:05:51](https://youtu.be/v4-FUP5Nefk?t=351) the way your body stores carbs is one  
[0:05:53](https://youtu.be/v4-FUP5Nefk?t=353) part carbohydrate or one part glycogen  
[0:05:55](https://youtu.be/v4-FUP5Nefk?t=355) actually i should say  
[0:05:56](https://youtu.be/v4-FUP5Nefk?t=356) three parts water so you have a lot of  
[0:05:58](https://youtu.be/v4-FUP5Nefk?t=358) water  
[0:05:58](https://youtu.be/v4-FUP5Nefk?t=358) when you eat carbs you retain more water  
[0:06:00](https://youtu.be/v4-FUP5Nefk?t=360) so we temporarily take away their carbs  
[0:06:02](https://youtu.be/v4-FUP5Nefk?t=362) let them shed that water  
[0:06:04](https://youtu.be/v4-FUP5Nefk?t=364) they lose weight after the weigh-in we  
[0:06:06](https://youtu.be/v4-FUP5Nefk?t=366) carved them up okay so to keep this  
[0:06:08](https://youtu.be/v4-FUP5Nefk?t=368) really simple look what kind of sport  
[0:06:10](https://youtu.be/v4-FUP5Nefk?t=370) are you in if you're in a sport that's  
[0:06:11](https://youtu.be/v4-FUP5Nefk?t=371) high-intensity eat carbs now i think  
[0:06:13](https://youtu.be/v4-FUP5Nefk?t=373) everybody should like i think the vast  
[0:06:15](https://youtu.be/v4-FUP5Nefk?t=375) majority of people will do well on what  
[0:06:17](https://youtu.be/v4-FUP5Nefk?t=377) they call a book called the starch  
[0:06:19](https://youtu.be/v4-FUP5Nefk?t=379) solution  
[0:06:20](https://youtu.be/v4-FUP5Nefk?t=380) you eat  
[0:06:21](https://youtu.be/v4-FUP5Nefk?t=381) it's a it's basically i'm not vegan okay  
[0:06:23](https://youtu.be/v4-FUP5Nefk?t=383) but i'm i'm  
[0:06:25](https://youtu.be/v4-FUP5Nefk?t=385) i don't believe we need so much animal  
[0:06:27](https://youtu.be/v4-FUP5Nefk?t=387) products okay there's a animal products  
[0:06:29](https://youtu.be/v4-FUP5Nefk?t=389) are really pushed on us because  
[0:06:31](https://youtu.be/v4-FUP5Nefk?t=391) i think it's it's big business right i  
[0:06:34](https://youtu.be/v4-FUP5Nefk?t=394) do believe in eating meat i think you  
[0:06:35](https://youtu.be/v4-FUP5Nefk?t=395) can have a deficiency on vegan diet long  
[0:06:36](https://youtu.be/v4-FUP5Nefk?t=396) term you can have problems what do you  
[0:06:38](https://youtu.be/v4-FUP5Nefk?t=398) think of just on this point what do you  
[0:06:39](https://youtu.be/v4-FUP5Nefk?t=399) think of the arguments that are being  
[0:06:41](https://youtu.be/v4-FUP5Nefk?t=401) put by many who kind of have a vegan  
[0:06:43](https://youtu.be/v4-FUP5Nefk?t=403) diet um the chi i think the china study  
[0:06:46](https://youtu.be/v4-FUP5Nefk?t=406) whatever of the meat and they say it's  
[0:06:48](https://youtu.be/v4-FUP5Nefk?t=408) um it brings you know there's a  
[0:06:50](https://youtu.be/v4-FUP5Nefk?t=410) correlation between cancer for example  
[0:06:52](https://youtu.be/v4-FUP5Nefk?t=412) um  
[0:06:54](https://youtu.be/v4-FUP5Nefk?t=414) to what extent do you kind of look at is  
[0:06:55](https://youtu.be/v4-FUP5Nefk?t=415) it meat or excessive amounts of meat  
[0:06:57](https://youtu.be/v4-FUP5Nefk?t=417) that's why i differentiate okay i think  
[0:06:59](https://youtu.be/v4-FUP5Nefk?t=419) eating meat three times a day is crazy i  
[0:07:00](https://youtu.be/v4-FUP5Nefk?t=420) think it's insane you might as well be a  
[0:07:02](https://youtu.be/v4-FUP5Nefk?t=422) smoker right okay you don't need that  
[0:07:04](https://youtu.be/v4-FUP5Nefk?t=424) much meat okay now i like to eat meat  
[0:07:06](https://youtu.be/v4-FUP5Nefk?t=426) when we're sitting around in a social  
[0:07:08](https://youtu.be/v4-FUP5Nefk?t=428) gathering okay somebody cooked meat  
[0:07:09](https://youtu.be/v4-FUP5Nefk?t=429) let's eat it and that includes fish by  
[0:07:11](https://youtu.be/v4-FUP5Nefk?t=431) the way  
[0:07:12](https://youtu.be/v4-FUP5Nefk?t=432) every type of animal product right even  
[0:07:14](https://youtu.be/v4-FUP5Nefk?t=434) if it's even  
[0:07:15](https://youtu.be/v4-FUP5Nefk?t=435) eggs and cheese every single animal  
[0:07:18](https://youtu.be/v4-FUP5Nefk?t=438) product mass-produced product in in one  
[0:07:20](https://youtu.be/v4-FUP5Nefk?t=440) way or another they they've  
[0:07:22](https://youtu.be/v4-FUP5Nefk?t=442) i hate to use the word poisoned it but  
[0:07:23](https://youtu.be/v4-FUP5Nefk?t=443) they they've done some bad things to it  
[0:07:26](https://youtu.be/v4-FUP5Nefk?t=446) yes you can get away  
[0:07:27](https://youtu.be/v4-FUP5Nefk?t=447) around it because  
[0:07:29](https://youtu.be/v4-FUP5Nefk?t=449) if you want to mass produce it they have  
[0:07:31](https://youtu.be/v4-FUP5Nefk?t=451) to mess with it  
[0:07:34](https://youtu.be/v4-FUP5Nefk?t=454) that's almost true of all our foods but  
[0:07:35](https://youtu.be/v4-FUP5Nefk?t=455) grains rice oatmeal pastas  
[0:07:39](https://youtu.be/v4-FUP5Nefk?t=459) if you have if you if you take in low  
[0:07:41](https://youtu.be/v4-FUP5Nefk?t=461) fat high carb you won't get fat just  
[0:07:43](https://youtu.be/v4-FUP5Nefk?t=463) like you won't get fat if you do high  
[0:07:45](https://youtu.be/v4-FUP5Nefk?t=465) fat low carb you could do it the other  
[0:07:47](https://youtu.be/v4-FUP5Nefk?t=467) way around  
[0:07:48](https://youtu.be/v4-FUP5Nefk?t=468) i prefer  
[0:07:49](https://youtu.be/v4-FUP5Nefk?t=469) high carb low fat because i'm in a  
[0:07:51](https://youtu.be/v4-FUP5Nefk?t=471) glycogen export i need that glycogen and  
[0:07:52](https://youtu.be/v4-FUP5Nefk?t=472) i feel full and satisfied one book i  
[0:07:54](https://youtu.be/v4-FUP5Nefk?t=474) really recommend is the starch  
[0:07:57](https://youtu.be/v4-FUP5Nefk?t=477) starch solution by john mcdougall  
[0:08:00](https://youtu.be/v4-FUP5Nefk?t=480) i think it's a fantastic book i think  
[0:08:01](https://youtu.be/v4-FUP5Nefk?t=481) people should try it  
[0:08:03](https://youtu.be/v4-FUP5Nefk?t=483) because you'll feel  
[0:08:04](https://youtu.be/v4-FUP5Nefk?t=484) very very good however i do believe he  
[0:08:06](https://youtu.be/v4-FUP5Nefk?t=486) goes too far i'm more of a nutritarian  
[0:08:08](https://youtu.be/v4-FUP5Nefk?t=488) like a joel furman where he gives you a  
[0:08:10](https://youtu.be/v4-FUP5Nefk?t=490) little more allowance of fat and meat  
[0:08:13](https://youtu.be/v4-FUP5Nefk?t=493) i think you should have meat once a day  
[0:08:16](https://youtu.be/v4-FUP5Nefk?t=496) if you're very active even once a week  
[0:08:17](https://youtu.be/v4-FUP5Nefk?t=497) from once a day to once but once a day  
[0:08:19](https://youtu.be/v4-FUP5Nefk?t=499) is too much even i think way too much  
[0:08:21](https://youtu.be/v4-FUP5Nefk?t=501) and if you eat meat should be like a  
[0:08:22](https://youtu.be/v4-FUP5Nefk?t=502) deck of cards not more  
[0:08:24](https://youtu.be/v4-FUP5Nefk?t=504) we eat too much animal products now look  
[0:08:26](https://youtu.be/v4-FUP5Nefk?t=506) my favorite thing to eat and for me is  
[0:08:28](https://youtu.be/v4-FUP5Nefk?t=508) steak so sometimes i make myself a nice  
[0:08:30](https://youtu.be/v4-FUP5Nefk?t=510) juicy steak i treat myself once in a  
[0:08:32](https://youtu.be/v4-FUP5Nefk?t=512) while  
[0:08:33](https://youtu.be/v4-FUP5Nefk?t=513) but you got to start equating steak with  
[0:08:36](https://youtu.be/v4-FUP5Nefk?t=516) like smoking would you do it every day  
[0:08:38](https://youtu.be/v4-FUP5Nefk?t=518) no i would do three times a day no like  
[0:08:40](https://youtu.be/v4-FUP5Nefk?t=520) be careful with eating meat it's not  
[0:08:41](https://youtu.be/v4-FUP5Nefk?t=521) healthy long term now a great example of  
[0:08:44](https://youtu.be/v4-FUP5Nefk?t=524) this is the okinawans the okinawans are  
[0:08:46](https://youtu.be/v4-FUP5Nefk?t=526) mainly vegan they eat sweet potato rice  
[0:08:48](https://youtu.be/v4-FUP5Nefk?t=528) vegetable and they eat fresh foods once  
[0:08:51](https://youtu.be/v4-FUP5Nefk?t=531) a month  
[0:08:54](https://youtu.be/v4-FUP5Nefk?t=534) so  
[0:08:55](https://youtu.be/v4-FUP5Nefk?t=535) how do we know all this well we observe  
[0:08:58](https://youtu.be/v4-FUP5Nefk?t=538) different uh different uh cultures how  
[0:09:00](https://youtu.be/v4-FUP5Nefk?t=540) they ate  
[0:09:02](https://youtu.be/v4-FUP5Nefk?t=542) like for instance the the inuits they  
[0:09:04](https://youtu.be/v4-FUP5Nefk?t=544) only eat fish  
[0:09:06](https://youtu.be/v4-FUP5Nefk?t=546) the age the the past in the united  
[0:09:08](https://youtu.be/v4-FUP5Nefk?t=548) states of the past today they have more  
[0:09:09](https://youtu.be/v4-FUP5Nefk?t=549) modern foods okay but  
[0:09:10](https://youtu.be/v4-FUP5Nefk?t=550) back in the day they used to eat mostly  
[0:09:12](https://youtu.be/v4-FUP5Nefk?t=552) fish you know they live in the arctic  
[0:09:14](https://youtu.be/v4-FUP5Nefk?t=554) yeah there's no uh grains there's no  
[0:09:16](https://youtu.be/v4-FUP5Nefk?t=556) vegetables good point here they never  
[0:09:18](https://youtu.be/v4-FUP5Nefk?t=558) die of heart disease because they're  
[0:09:19](https://youtu.be/v4-FUP5Nefk?t=559) eating fish but they die of cancer  
[0:09:22](https://youtu.be/v4-FUP5Nefk?t=562) so we know that too much eating  
[0:09:25](https://youtu.be/v4-FUP5Nefk?t=565) flesh foods can lead to cancer again  
[0:09:27](https://youtu.be/v4-FUP5Nefk?t=567) there's always more elements there's  
[0:09:28](https://youtu.be/v4-FUP5Nefk?t=568) always more to the story it's always  
[0:09:30](https://youtu.be/v4-FUP5Nefk?t=570) more complicated however there is a  
[0:09:31](https://youtu.be/v4-FUP5Nefk?t=571) there is a correlation between eating  
[0:09:33](https://youtu.be/v4-FUP5Nefk?t=573) fresh foods  
[0:09:35](https://youtu.be/v4-FUP5Nefk?t=575) and cancer  
[0:09:37](https://youtu.be/v4-FUP5Nefk?t=577) so and and many other ailments so i  
[0:09:38](https://youtu.be/v4-FUP5Nefk?t=578) would tell you that personally from my  
[0:09:41](https://youtu.be/v4-FUP5Nefk?t=581) researches and studying this for so many  
[0:09:42](https://youtu.be/v4-FUP5Nefk?t=582) years i would tell you that  
[0:09:46](https://youtu.be/v4-FUP5Nefk?t=586) i'm not vegan because i think also  
[0:09:47](https://youtu.be/v4-FUP5Nefk?t=587) veganism will lead to problems yeah  
[0:09:50](https://youtu.be/v4-FUP5Nefk?t=590) vitamin deficiency problems yeah calcium  
[0:09:52](https://youtu.be/v4-FUP5Nefk?t=592) deficiency  
[0:09:53](https://youtu.be/v4-FUP5Nefk?t=593) loss of muscle okay they try to say no  
[0:09:55](https://youtu.be/v4-FUP5Nefk?t=595) you don't need it i don't i've i believe  
[0:09:57](https://youtu.be/v4-FUP5Nefk?t=597) you lose muscle i would love to debate  
[0:09:58](https://youtu.be/v4-FUP5Nefk?t=598) somebody who who says it different  
[0:10:00](https://youtu.be/v4-FUP5Nefk?t=600) because you can get your proteins on a  
[0:10:02](https://youtu.be/v4-FUP5Nefk?t=602) plant diet but it's hard it's difficult  
[0:10:04](https://youtu.be/v4-FUP5Nefk?t=604) most people won't do it right it's  
[0:10:06](https://youtu.be/v4-FUP5Nefk?t=606) complicated that's my point it's complex  
[0:10:08](https://youtu.be/v4-FUP5Nefk?t=608) vegan diet you have to you have to be  
[0:10:09](https://youtu.be/v4-FUP5Nefk?t=609) you have to know so much about  
[0:10:11](https://youtu.be/v4-FUP5Nefk?t=611) everything it's very complicated so i  
[0:10:13](https://youtu.be/v4-FUP5Nefk?t=613) don't recommend it but i recommend  
[0:10:16](https://youtu.be/v4-FUP5Nefk?t=616) because you see when the animal eats  
[0:10:17](https://youtu.be/v4-FUP5Nefk?t=617) certain nutrients and you eat that  
[0:10:19](https://youtu.be/v4-FUP5Nefk?t=619) animal you get those nutrients  
[0:10:22](https://youtu.be/v4-FUP5Nefk?t=622) make it simple just eat a serving of  
[0:10:24](https://youtu.be/v4-FUP5Nefk?t=624) meat two to three times a week and again  
[0:10:26](https://youtu.be/v4-FUP5Nefk?t=626) it can vary some people will do better  
[0:10:28](https://youtu.be/v4-FUP5Nefk?t=628) on one portion of meat a week some  
[0:10:30](https://youtu.be/v4-FUP5Nefk?t=630) people do better on one portion of meat  
[0:10:32](https://youtu.be/v4-FUP5Nefk?t=632) per month you have to experiment  
[0:10:34](https://youtu.be/v4-FUP5Nefk?t=634) so me when i feel my best is when i have  
[0:10:37](https://youtu.be/v4-FUP5Nefk?t=637) meat let's say three times a week and  
[0:10:38](https://youtu.be/v4-FUP5Nefk?t=638) i'm talking about small portions of meat  
[0:10:40](https://youtu.be/v4-FUP5Nefk?t=640) that's when i'm feeling my best i feel  
[0:10:41](https://youtu.be/v4-FUP5Nefk?t=641) the most energy i feel the most active i  
[0:10:43](https://youtu.be/v4-FUP5Nefk?t=643) feel the most lean i feel the most  
[0:10:45](https://youtu.be/v4-FUP5Nefk?t=645) vibrant  
[0:10:46](https://youtu.be/v4-FUP5Nefk?t=646) so  
[0:10:47](https://youtu.be/v4-FUP5Nefk?t=647) there's a lot to say with cutting out  
[0:10:49](https://youtu.be/v4-FUP5Nefk?t=649) animal products but people are so  
[0:10:51](https://youtu.be/v4-FUP5Nefk?t=651) conditioned that if they don't eat  
[0:10:52](https://youtu.be/v4-FUP5Nefk?t=652) animal products something bad is going  
[0:10:53](https://youtu.be/v4-FUP5Nefk?t=653) to happen it's not true it's actually  
[0:10:55](https://youtu.be/v4-FUP5Nefk?t=655) the opposite when you lower your animal  
[0:10:56](https://youtu.be/v4-FUP5Nefk?t=656) products  
[0:10:58](https://youtu.be/v4-FUP5Nefk?t=658) your cardio will go up your well-being  
[0:11:00](https://youtu.be/v4-FUP5Nefk?t=660) will go up your energy will go up  
[0:11:01](https://youtu.be/v4-FUP5Nefk?t=661) everything will go up you don't need so  
[0:11:04](https://youtu.be/v4-FUP5Nefk?t=664) much flesh food  
[0:11:07](https://youtu.be/v4-FUP5Nefk?t=667) and so so okay you've kind of alluded to  
[0:11:10](https://youtu.be/v4-FUP5Nefk?t=670) the fact that going vegan sometimes is i  
[0:11:13](https://youtu.be/v4-FUP5Nefk?t=673) mean maybe i'm reading this wrong but  
[0:11:14](https://youtu.be/v4-FUP5Nefk?t=674) being being vegan sometimes is a good  
[0:11:16](https://youtu.be/v4-FUP5Nefk?t=676) thing  
[0:11:17](https://youtu.be/v4-FUP5Nefk?t=677) but you've also said that we need meat  
[0:11:19](https://youtu.be/v4-FUP5Nefk?t=679) so how would you play it so you got 52  
[0:11:20](https://youtu.be/v4-FUP5Nefk?t=680) weeks in a year  
[0:11:22](https://youtu.be/v4-FUP5Nefk?t=682) you got 365 days do you do it in such a  
[0:11:24](https://youtu.be/v4-FUP5Nefk?t=684) way that okay like your one week on one  
[0:11:26](https://youtu.be/v4-FUP5Nefk?t=686) week off or how do you how would you  
[0:11:27](https://youtu.be/v4-FUP5Nefk?t=687) play it i would i would recommend people  
[0:11:29](https://youtu.be/v4-FUP5Nefk?t=689) try eating meat if you eat meat every  
[0:11:31](https://youtu.be/v4-FUP5Nefk?t=691) day yeah try to even eat three three  
[0:11:34](https://youtu.be/v4-FUP5Nefk?t=694) portions a week now lower it then go to  
[0:11:37](https://youtu.be/v4-FUP5Nefk?t=697) once a week  
[0:11:38](https://youtu.be/v4-FUP5Nefk?t=698) slowly work your way don't do anything  
[0:11:40](https://youtu.be/v4-FUP5Nefk?t=700) drastic  
[0:11:41](https://youtu.be/v4-FUP5Nefk?t=701) does that apply with like animal  
[0:11:42](https://youtu.be/v4-FUP5Nefk?t=702) products as well actually everything  
[0:11:43](https://youtu.be/v4-FUP5Nefk?t=703) that comes from jesus jesus everything  
[0:11:45](https://youtu.be/v4-FUP5Nefk?t=705) the  
[0:11:46](https://youtu.be/v4-FUP5Nefk?t=706) the farming industry has completely  
[0:11:48](https://youtu.be/v4-FUP5Nefk?t=708) polluted our food  
[0:11:50](https://youtu.be/v4-FUP5Nefk?t=710) everything has been touched  
[0:11:52](https://youtu.be/v4-FUP5Nefk?t=712) unless you're ready to spend a million  
[0:11:53](https://youtu.be/v4-FUP5Nefk?t=713) dollars on your food a year you can't  
[0:11:55](https://youtu.be/v4-FUP5Nefk?t=715) eat untainted foods it's very difficult  
[0:11:57](https://youtu.be/v4-FUP5Nefk?t=717) okay like i'm a million dollars in  
[0:11:58](https://youtu.be/v4-FUP5Nefk?t=718) exaggeration i'm just trying to  
[0:12:00](https://youtu.be/v4-FUP5Nefk?t=720) spend a lot of money trying to get  
[0:12:02](https://youtu.be/v4-FUP5Nefk?t=722) organic never been touched by anybody  
[0:12:04](https://youtu.be/v4-FUP5Nefk?t=724) food it's tough  
[0:12:06](https://youtu.be/v4-FUP5Nefk?t=726) um i really recommend people experiment  
[0:12:08](https://youtu.be/v4-FUP5Nefk?t=728) with lowering the amount of fresh foods  
[0:12:10](https://youtu.be/v4-FUP5Nefk?t=730) they eat we've been we've been  
[0:12:12](https://youtu.be/v4-FUP5Nefk?t=732) brainwashed we've been marketed to  
[0:12:15](https://youtu.be/v4-FUP5Nefk?t=735) to eat milk cheese uh flesh foods this  
[0:12:18](https://youtu.be/v4-FUP5Nefk?t=738) is very important this is number one  
[0:12:20](https://youtu.be/v4-FUP5Nefk?t=740) it's not true it's not true so you're  
[0:12:22](https://youtu.be/v4-FUP5Nefk?t=742) saying go down so you're down if you're  
[0:12:24](https://youtu.be/v4-FUP5Nefk?t=744) eating it three times a day go once  
[0:12:27](https://youtu.be/v4-FUP5Nefk?t=747) oh yeah if you're eating me three times  
[0:12:28](https://youtu.be/v4-FUP5Nefk?t=748) a day you're killing yourself like i  
[0:12:29](https://youtu.be/v4-FUP5Nefk?t=749) don't see how you could function like i  
[0:12:31](https://youtu.be/v4-FUP5Nefk?t=751) i couldn't picture myself eating meat  
[0:12:32](https://youtu.be/v4-FUP5Nefk?t=752) three times a day i used to what should  
[0:12:34](https://youtu.be/v4-FUP5Nefk?t=754) i like then in the morning i eat  
[0:12:36](https://youtu.be/v4-FUP5Nefk?t=756) generally oatmeal okay i think oatmeal  
[0:12:37](https://youtu.be/v4-FUP5Nefk?t=757) is the ultimate breakfast because it  
[0:12:39](https://youtu.be/v4-FUP5Nefk?t=759) makes you feel satiated for longer about  
[0:12:40](https://youtu.be/v4-FUP5Nefk?t=760) eggs and stuff no eggs no if i eat eggs  
[0:12:43](https://youtu.be/v4-FUP5Nefk?t=763) for pleasure if i'm sitting down it's a  
[0:12:44](https://youtu.be/v4-FUP5Nefk?t=764) saturday morning and i'm eating with my  
[0:12:46](https://youtu.be/v4-FUP5Nefk?t=766) family we'll make eggs it's a i love  
[0:12:48](https://youtu.be/v4-FUP5Nefk?t=768) eggs i can eat eggs every day if you  
[0:12:50](https://youtu.be/v4-FUP5Nefk?t=770) give me but because of the consequence  
[0:12:51](https://youtu.be/v4-FUP5Nefk?t=771) of eating eggs every day i do not eat  
[0:12:53](https://youtu.be/v4-FUP5Nefk?t=773) eggs every day okay but in terms of  
[0:12:54](https://youtu.be/v4-FUP5Nefk?t=774) enjoyment i don't know there's nothing  
[0:12:56](https://youtu.be/v4-FUP5Nefk?t=776) more i love than toasting eggs in the  
[0:12:57](https://youtu.be/v4-FUP5Nefk?t=777) morning  
[0:12:59](https://youtu.be/v4-FUP5Nefk?t=779) i'll have eggs once in a while but  
[0:13:00](https://youtu.be/v4-FUP5Nefk?t=780) having eggs every day is bad for you in  
[0:13:02](https://youtu.be/v4-FUP5Nefk?t=782) my opinion it's not good  
[0:13:03](https://youtu.be/v4-FUP5Nefk?t=783) all right so that's breakfast so what's  
[0:13:05](https://youtu.be/v4-FUP5Nefk?t=785) lunch like for you  
[0:13:07](https://youtu.be/v4-FUP5Nefk?t=787) lunch i'll have rice potato salad  
[0:13:10](https://youtu.be/v4-FUP5Nefk?t=790) and a little bit of meat maybe  
[0:13:12](https://youtu.be/v4-FUP5Nefk?t=792) if i'm training really hard  
[0:13:14](https://youtu.be/v4-FUP5Nefk?t=794) chicken okay a lean chicken you got to  
[0:13:16](https://youtu.be/v4-FUP5Nefk?t=796) try to keep it lean and a small portion  
[0:13:17](https://youtu.be/v4-FUP5Nefk?t=797) like we're talking about a deck of cards  
[0:13:19](https://youtu.be/v4-FUP5Nefk?t=799) what about dinner  
[0:13:21](https://youtu.be/v4-FUP5Nefk?t=801) dinner i'll probably do something like  
[0:13:23](https://youtu.be/v4-FUP5Nefk?t=803) uh it'll be very similar to lunch it'll  
[0:13:25](https://youtu.be/v4-FUP5Nefk?t=805) be a  
[0:13:26](https://youtu.be/v4-FUP5Nefk?t=806) pasta or or  
[0:13:28](https://youtu.be/v4-FUP5Nefk?t=808) rice or  
[0:13:29](https://youtu.be/v4-FUP5Nefk?t=809) a sweet potato with a little ketchup  
[0:13:32](https://youtu.be/v4-FUP5Nefk?t=812) maybe a few fruit you know i try to keep  
[0:13:34](https://youtu.be/v4-FUP5Nefk?t=814) fruit low as well and i do a lot of  
[0:13:37](https://youtu.be/v4-FUP5Nefk?t=817) lentils sometimes i'll make hummus with  
[0:13:39](https://youtu.be/v4-FUP5Nefk?t=819) bread hummus and bread it's vegan it's  
[0:13:41](https://youtu.be/v4-FUP5Nefk?t=821) good if you have that right so that's it  
[0:13:42](https://youtu.be/v4-FUP5Nefk?t=822) that's enough and sometimes i don't even  
[0:13:44](https://youtu.be/v4-FUP5Nefk?t=824) eat dinner when i want to lose weight i  
[0:13:46](https://youtu.be/v4-FUP5Nefk?t=826) don't even eat dinner i'll eat from ten  
[0:13:47](https://youtu.be/v4-FUP5Nefk?t=827) to six  
[0:13:48](https://youtu.be/v4-FUP5Nefk?t=828) so for me i go to practice after six so  
[0:13:50](https://youtu.be/v4-FUP5Nefk?t=830) after training there's no there's no  
[0:13:52](https://youtu.be/v4-FUP5Nefk?t=832) meal after i drink water and go to bed  
[0:13:53](https://youtu.be/v4-FUP5Nefk?t=833) that's it  
[0:13:55](https://youtu.be/v4-FUP5Nefk?t=835) and so do you have only three meals a  
[0:13:56](https://youtu.be/v4-FUP5Nefk?t=836) day  
[0:13:58](https://youtu.be/v4-FUP5Nefk?t=838) um  
[0:13:59](https://youtu.be/v4-FUP5Nefk?t=839) i eat about three meals a day with with  
[0:14:01](https://youtu.be/v4-FUP5Nefk?t=841) a few snacks but in a window small  
[0:14:03](https://youtu.be/v4-FUP5Nefk?t=843) window and i think people have to learn  
[0:14:04](https://youtu.be/v4-FUP5Nefk?t=844) to skip meals okay tell us about  
[0:14:07](https://youtu.be/v4-FUP5Nefk?t=847) intermittent fasting because this is a  
[0:14:08](https://youtu.be/v4-FUP5Nefk?t=848) big thing for you isn't it intermittent  
[0:14:10](https://youtu.be/v4-FUP5Nefk?t=850) fasting is huge if you want to keep your  
[0:14:11](https://youtu.be/v4-FUP5Nefk?t=851) youth yeah intermittent fasting is  
[0:14:13](https://youtu.be/v4-FUP5Nefk?t=853) massive what is it first of all for  
[0:14:15](https://youtu.be/v4-FUP5Nefk?t=855) those of you intermittent fasting is  
[0:14:19](https://youtu.be/v4-FUP5Nefk?t=859) it's hard to define because you could  
[0:14:20](https://youtu.be/v4-FUP5Nefk?t=860) say look i fast it for 12 hours is that  
[0:14:22](https://youtu.be/v4-FUP5Nefk?t=862) intimate fasting yes but a very a very  
[0:14:24](https://youtu.be/v4-FUP5Nefk?t=864) beginner level so i always tell people  
[0:14:26](https://youtu.be/v4-FUP5Nefk?t=866) look try to eat from nine to nine  
[0:14:28](https://youtu.be/v4-FUP5Nefk?t=868) then from nine am to eight  
[0:14:30](https://youtu.be/v4-FUP5Nefk?t=870) from nine to seven and slowly because it  
[0:14:32](https://youtu.be/v4-FUP5Nefk?t=872) gets easier  
[0:14:33](https://youtu.be/v4-FUP5Nefk?t=873) then all of a sudden you're eating from  
[0:14:35](https://youtu.be/v4-FUP5Nefk?t=875) nine to six and you're full after six  
[0:14:36](https://youtu.be/v4-FUP5Nefk?t=876) you don't want to eat anymore what are  
[0:14:37](https://youtu.be/v4-FUP5Nefk?t=877) the benefits of that when you don't eat  
[0:14:40](https://youtu.be/v4-FUP5Nefk?t=880) for at least 16 hours  
[0:14:42](https://youtu.be/v4-FUP5Nefk?t=882) about 16 hours now this is a  
[0:14:43](https://youtu.be/v4-FUP5Nefk?t=883) guesstimation okay it's not exactly the  
[0:14:44](https://youtu.be/v4-FUP5Nefk?t=884) 16 hours for everybody depending on how  
[0:14:46](https://youtu.be/v4-FUP5Nefk?t=886) how how much you exercise how much you  
[0:14:48](https://youtu.be/v4-FUP5Nefk?t=888) ate the day before et cetera but  
[0:14:49](https://youtu.be/v4-FUP5Nefk?t=889) approximately 16 hours we know that a  
[0:14:51](https://youtu.be/v4-FUP5Nefk?t=891) phenomenon now we that they call  
[0:14:53](https://youtu.be/v4-FUP5Nefk?t=893) autophagy the nobel prize was given for  
[0:14:55](https://youtu.be/v4-FUP5Nefk?t=895) this discovery in 2016. so it's a  
[0:14:58](https://youtu.be/v4-FUP5Nefk?t=898) scientific fact autophagy is a greek  
[0:15:00](https://youtu.be/v4-FUP5Nefk?t=900) word for  
[0:15:01](https://youtu.be/v4-FUP5Nefk?t=901) uh self-digestion your body when it  
[0:15:03](https://youtu.be/v4-FUP5Nefk?t=903) after 16 hours of eating starts to eat  
[0:15:05](https://youtu.be/v4-FUP5Nefk?t=905) itself without eating sources after 16  
[0:15:07](https://youtu.be/v4-FUP5Nefk?t=907) hours of no food no intake  
[0:15:10](https://youtu.be/v4-FUP5Nefk?t=910) your body starts to consume its own  
[0:15:11](https://youtu.be/v4-FUP5Nefk?t=911) cells  
[0:15:13](https://youtu.be/v4-FUP5Nefk?t=913) the cells that it'll consume first  
[0:15:15](https://youtu.be/v4-FUP5Nefk?t=915) are the more uh  
[0:15:17](https://youtu.be/v4-FUP5Nefk?t=917) the poorest cells the weakest cells the  
[0:15:19](https://youtu.be/v4-FUP5Nefk?t=919) the the poorly replicated cells i should  
[0:15:21](https://youtu.be/v4-FUP5Nefk?t=921) say  
[0:15:22](https://youtu.be/v4-FUP5Nefk?t=922) and those are the cells that are toxic  
[0:15:24](https://youtu.be/v4-FUP5Nefk?t=924) cancerous etc i'm relying on the work of  
[0:15:26](https://youtu.be/v4-FUP5Nefk?t=926) jason fong okay i'm not a biologist here  
[0:15:28](https://youtu.be/v4-FUP5Nefk?t=928) but jason's fund's work uh the  
[0:15:31](https://youtu.be/v4-FUP5Nefk?t=931) all you need to know about fasting he  
[0:15:32](https://youtu.be/v4-FUP5Nefk?t=932) goes into it he has a great book called  
[0:15:34](https://youtu.be/v4-FUP5Nefk?t=934) all you need to know about fasting he  
[0:15:35](https://youtu.be/v4-FUP5Nefk?t=935) has a few books on fasting and uh he  
[0:15:38](https://youtu.be/v4-FUP5Nefk?t=938) talks about how his claim not mine that  
[0:15:40](https://youtu.be/v4-FUP5Nefk?t=940) even fasting combats cancer  
[0:15:43](https://youtu.be/v4-FUP5Nefk?t=943) and for this reason for autophagy again  
[0:15:45](https://youtu.be/v4-FUP5Nefk?t=945) if you want to get into the specifics  
[0:15:46](https://youtu.be/v4-FUP5Nefk?t=946) you have to rely on his work he's a  
[0:15:48](https://youtu.be/v4-FUP5Nefk?t=948) doctor out of toronto he's the one who  
[0:15:49](https://youtu.be/v4-FUP5Nefk?t=949) helped georgetown pierre uh  
[0:15:51](https://youtu.be/v4-FUP5Nefk?t=951) combat uh  
[0:15:52](https://youtu.be/v4-FUP5Nefk?t=952) his uh colitis without drugs without  
[0:15:55](https://youtu.be/v4-FUP5Nefk?t=955) using drugs just using fasting  
[0:15:57](https://youtu.be/v4-FUP5Nefk?t=957) and he did it successfully  
[0:15:59](https://youtu.be/v4-FUP5Nefk?t=959) and uh many of us started fasting after  
[0:16:01](https://youtu.be/v4-FUP5Nefk?t=961) that as well and we saw a huge benefit  
[0:16:03](https://youtu.be/v4-FUP5Nefk?t=963) that of course we fast because we're  
[0:16:04](https://youtu.be/v4-FUP5Nefk?t=964) muslim since we're young  
[0:16:06](https://youtu.be/v4-FUP5Nefk?t=966) but  
[0:16:07](https://youtu.be/v4-FUP5Nefk?t=967) doing fasting throughout the year also  
[0:16:08](https://youtu.be/v4-FUP5Nefk?t=968) has major benefits and i feel that um  
[0:16:12](https://youtu.be/v4-FUP5Nefk?t=972) it's something that's  
[0:16:13](https://youtu.be/v4-FUP5Nefk?t=973) very very beneficial even for your  
[0:16:15](https://youtu.be/v4-FUP5Nefk?t=975) hormones  
[0:16:16](https://youtu.be/v4-FUP5Nefk?t=976) however i think again it should be  
[0:16:17](https://youtu.be/v4-FUP5Nefk?t=977) gradual and there's two you can go too  
[0:16:19](https://youtu.be/v4-FUP5Nefk?t=979) far you can fast for too long and make  
[0:16:21](https://youtu.be/v4-FUP5Nefk?t=981) yourself weak and frail we don't want to  
[0:16:23](https://youtu.be/v4-FUP5Nefk?t=983) fast for too long  
[0:16:25](https://youtu.be/v4-FUP5Nefk?t=985) 16 hours of fasting seems to be really  
[0:16:27](https://youtu.be/v4-FUP5Nefk?t=987) good  
[0:16:28](https://youtu.be/v4-FUP5Nefk?t=988) and  
[0:16:29](https://youtu.be/v4-FUP5Nefk?t=989) some you can experiment with 18  
[0:16:30](https://youtu.be/v4-FUP5Nefk?t=990) sometimes i even do one meal a day  
[0:16:34](https://youtu.be/v4-FUP5Nefk?t=994) like today i i we ate a meal together  
[0:16:36](https://youtu.be/v4-FUP5Nefk?t=996) that's my only meal for the day and last  
[0:16:38](https://youtu.be/v4-FUP5Nefk?t=998) time i ate was yesterday morning wow so  
[0:16:40](https://youtu.be/v4-FUP5Nefk?t=1000) that's it for today why because today  
[0:16:41](https://youtu.be/v4-FUP5Nefk?t=1001) i'm not training i'm not exercising i'm  
[0:16:42](https://youtu.be/v4-FUP5Nefk?t=1002) doing very little i have a wake-up call  
[0:16:44](https://youtu.be/v4-FUP5Nefk?t=1004) if you're training then you do what two  
[0:16:46](https://youtu.be/v4-FUP5Nefk?t=1006) i would i wouldn't have eaten such a  
[0:16:47](https://youtu.be/v4-FUP5Nefk?t=1007) large meal and i would have i would have  
[0:16:49](https://youtu.be/v4-FUP5Nefk?t=1009) ate throughout the day i see so it could  
[0:16:51](https://youtu.be/v4-FUP5Nefk?t=1011) be digested when i get to practice  
[0:16:53](https://youtu.be/v4-FUP5Nefk?t=1013) so look i really believe i really like  
[0:16:55](https://youtu.be/v4-FUP5Nefk?t=1015) this app called the fast tick  
[0:16:58](https://youtu.be/v4-FUP5Nefk?t=1018) f-a-s-t-i-c because it kind of gives you  
[0:17:01](https://youtu.be/v4-FUP5Nefk?t=1021) the road map of what your body's doing  
[0:17:03](https://youtu.be/v4-FUP5Nefk?t=1023) so you start fasting you click the  
[0:17:05](https://youtu.be/v4-FUP5Nefk?t=1025) button it tells you what phase you're in  
[0:17:06](https://youtu.be/v4-FUP5Nefk?t=1026) you don't get commissioned for saying no  
[0:17:07](https://youtu.be/v4-FUP5Nefk?t=1027) no  
[0:17:09](https://youtu.be/v4-FUP5Nefk?t=1029) no it's it's a great app because it kind  
[0:17:11](https://youtu.be/v4-FUP5Nefk?t=1031) of like  
[0:17:12](https://youtu.be/v4-FUP5Nefk?t=1032) it explains to you why you're feeling  
[0:17:13](https://youtu.be/v4-FUP5Nefk?t=1033) this way oh my god i'm feeling like this  
[0:17:15](https://youtu.be/v4-FUP5Nefk?t=1035) yeah don't worry wait a little bit  
[0:17:16](https://youtu.be/v4-FUP5Nefk?t=1036) longer your blood sugar levels are going  
[0:17:18](https://youtu.be/v4-FUP5Nefk?t=1038) to stabilize and it does and it's just a  
[0:17:20](https://youtu.be/v4-FUP5Nefk?t=1040) great way to train yourself to know the  
[0:17:22](https://youtu.be/v4-FUP5Nefk?t=1042) different phases of fasting and fasting  
[0:17:24](https://youtu.be/v4-FUP5Nefk?t=1044) the great thing about fasting can be  
[0:17:25](https://youtu.be/v4-FUP5Nefk?t=1045) quite addictive  
[0:17:26](https://youtu.be/v4-FUP5Nefk?t=1046) because if you fast long often enough  
[0:17:28](https://youtu.be/v4-FUP5Nefk?t=1048) you start actually to get a  
[0:17:30](https://youtu.be/v4-FUP5Nefk?t=1050) cognitively uh charged  
[0:17:33](https://youtu.be/v4-FUP5Nefk?t=1053) start being really alert really yeah  
[0:17:35](https://youtu.be/v4-FUP5Nefk?t=1055) yeah plato wouldn't uh  
[0:17:36](https://youtu.be/v4-FUP5Nefk?t=1056) uh except students that were in a fasted  
[0:17:38](https://youtu.be/v4-FUP5Nefk?t=1058) state  
[0:17:39](https://youtu.be/v4-FUP5Nefk?t=1059) because you become cognitively charged  
[0:17:41](https://youtu.be/v4-FUP5Nefk?t=1061) oh yeah absolutely yeah yeah you can be  
[0:17:44](https://youtu.be/v4-FUP5Nefk?t=1064) if you fast long enough intensely enough  
[0:17:46](https://youtu.be/v4-FUP5Nefk?t=1066) over a time  
[0:17:48](https://youtu.be/v4-FUP5Nefk?t=1068) you will have this cognitive charge it's  
[0:17:50](https://youtu.be/v4-FUP5Nefk?t=1070) hard to explain but it's just a mental  
[0:17:52](https://youtu.be/v4-FUP5Nefk?t=1072) alertness it's kind of like drinking  
[0:17:53](https://youtu.be/v4-FUP5Nefk?t=1073) five espressos you know it's an  
[0:17:54](https://youtu.be/v4-FUP5Nefk?t=1074) enjoyable feeling because  
[0:17:56](https://youtu.be/v4-FUP5Nefk?t=1076) when you when you eat all the time the  
[0:17:59](https://youtu.be/v4-FUP5Nefk?t=1079) blood flow goes towards the stomach it  
[0:18:00](https://youtu.be/v4-FUP5Nefk?t=1080) drains blood from the brain it does make  
[0:18:02](https://youtu.be/v4-FUP5Nefk?t=1082) there's a chain reaction but after a  
[0:18:04](https://youtu.be/v4-FUP5Nefk?t=1084) while of not eating you're totally  
[0:18:06](https://youtu.be/v4-FUP5Nefk?t=1086) totally digested  
[0:18:08](https://youtu.be/v4-FUP5Nefk?t=1088) you've given your system a break  
[0:18:11](https://youtu.be/v4-FUP5Nefk?t=1091) your system seems to one way or another  
[0:18:14](https://youtu.be/v4-FUP5Nefk?t=1094) have more energy for some people say  
[0:18:15](https://youtu.be/v4-FUP5Nefk?t=1095) it's the ketones because your body  
[0:18:16](https://youtu.be/v4-FUP5Nefk?t=1096) starts burning ketones and ketones it's  
[0:18:18](https://youtu.be/v4-FUP5Nefk?t=1098) almost like hey your body's starving  
[0:18:20](https://youtu.be/v4-FUP5Nefk?t=1100) give him the good fuel let him find  
[0:18:21](https://youtu.be/v4-FUP5Nefk?t=1101) resources right now you know make him  
[0:18:23](https://youtu.be/v4-FUP5Nefk?t=1103) super alert make him super cognitive  
[0:18:25](https://youtu.be/v4-FUP5Nefk?t=1105) because he  
[0:18:26](https://youtu.be/v4-FUP5Nefk?t=1106) again this is a narrative i'm just  
[0:18:28](https://youtu.be/v4-FUP5Nefk?t=1108) giving you a nerve  
[0:18:29](https://youtu.be/v4-FUP5Nefk?t=1109) give him the really good stuff the  
[0:18:30](https://youtu.be/v4-FUP5Nefk?t=1110) ketones so that he goes out in nature  
[0:18:32](https://youtu.be/v4-FUP5Nefk?t=1112) and finds some resources  
[0:18:34](https://youtu.be/v4-FUP5Nefk?t=1114) you know make him super alert uh you get  
[0:18:36](https://youtu.be/v4-FUP5Nefk?t=1116) this level of a heightened awareness  
[0:18:39](https://youtu.be/v4-FUP5Nefk?t=1119) that comes with prolonged  
[0:18:40](https://youtu.be/v4-FUP5Nefk?t=1120) fasting and so  
[0:18:43](https://youtu.be/v4-FUP5Nefk?t=1123) what breaks your fast because  
[0:18:45](https://youtu.be/v4-FUP5Nefk?t=1125) people might be thinking about dry fats  
[0:18:46](https://youtu.be/v4-FUP5Nefk?t=1126) right now that's the kind of only  
[0:18:48](https://youtu.be/v4-FUP5Nefk?t=1128) experience they may have had the ramadan  
[0:18:50](https://youtu.be/v4-FUP5Nefk?t=1130) fast for example  
[0:18:51](https://youtu.be/v4-FUP5Nefk?t=1131) so you're not talking about that you're  
[0:18:53](https://youtu.be/v4-FUP5Nefk?t=1133) what you can still drink water right  
[0:18:54](https://youtu.be/v4-FUP5Nefk?t=1134) yeah especially because we're training  
[0:18:56](https://youtu.be/v4-FUP5Nefk?t=1136) throughout the day we need water that's  
[0:18:57](https://youtu.be/v4-FUP5Nefk?t=1137) number one yeah two percent dehydration  
[0:18:59](https://youtu.be/v4-FUP5Nefk?t=1139) equals six percent loss in performance  
[0:19:01](https://youtu.be/v4-FUP5Nefk?t=1141) say that again two percent dehydration  
[0:19:04](https://youtu.be/v4-FUP5Nefk?t=1144) really  
[0:19:05](https://youtu.be/v4-FUP5Nefk?t=1145) equates to six percent loss in  
[0:19:07](https://youtu.be/v4-FUP5Nefk?t=1147) performance now this is uh this study  
[0:19:10](https://youtu.be/v4-FUP5Nefk?t=1150) was done on soldiers running through  
[0:19:11](https://youtu.be/v4-FUP5Nefk?t=1151) gauntlets they have to run shoot et  
[0:19:12](https://youtu.be/v4-FUP5Nefk?t=1152) cetera  
[0:19:13](https://youtu.be/v4-FUP5Nefk?t=1153) and they can only ethically dehydrate  
[0:19:15](https://youtu.be/v4-FUP5Nefk?t=1155) them two percent not more so all we have  
[0:19:17](https://youtu.be/v4-FUP5Nefk?t=1157) is two percent studies on two percent  
[0:19:19](https://youtu.be/v4-FUP5Nefk?t=1159) dehydration imagine there may be a law  
[0:19:21](https://youtu.be/v4-FUP5Nefk?t=1161) of diminishing returns right could be  
[0:19:22](https://youtu.be/v4-FUP5Nefk?t=1162) yeah  
[0:19:23](https://youtu.be/v4-FUP5Nefk?t=1163) but ethically they say they can only go  
[0:19:25](https://youtu.be/v4-FUP5Nefk?t=1165) two percent so what happens  
[0:19:27](https://youtu.be/v4-FUP5Nefk?t=1167) they got six percent and they say even  
[0:19:29](https://youtu.be/v4-FUP5Nefk?t=1169) the top of the top  
[0:19:31](https://youtu.be/v4-FUP5Nefk?t=1171) soldiers had a diminished  
[0:19:33](https://youtu.be/v4-FUP5Nefk?t=1173) ability by six percent yeah so it  
[0:19:35](https://youtu.be/v4-FUP5Nefk?t=1175) doesn't matter how tough you are you  
[0:19:36](https://youtu.be/v4-FUP5Nefk?t=1176) need hydration hydration is more  
[0:19:38](https://youtu.be/v4-FUP5Nefk?t=1178) important even than food you said you  
[0:19:39](https://youtu.be/v4-FUP5Nefk?t=1179) could also have black coffee right black  
[0:19:41](https://youtu.be/v4-FUP5Nefk?t=1181) coffee tea  
[0:19:43](https://youtu.be/v4-FUP5Nefk?t=1183) and uh water  
[0:19:45](https://youtu.be/v4-FUP5Nefk?t=1185) what's that no no no no milk milk will  
[0:19:47](https://youtu.be/v4-FUP5Nefk?t=1187) will spike your insulin so you have a  
[0:19:48](https://youtu.be/v4-FUP5Nefk?t=1188) java insulin response which you don't  
[0:19:50](https://youtu.be/v4-FUP5Nefk?t=1190) want during your fast  
[0:19:51](https://youtu.be/v4-FUP5Nefk?t=1191) okay now this is in relation to  
[0:19:54](https://youtu.be/v4-FUP5Nefk?t=1194) diet i think you've kind of covered a  
[0:19:56](https://youtu.be/v4-FUP5Nefk?t=1196) lot of bases there and that maybe many  
[0:19:58](https://youtu.be/v4-FUP5Nefk?t=1198) people will be changing their lives for  
[0:19:59](https://youtu.be/v4-FUP5Nefk?t=1199) the better and that's what we're really  
[0:20:01](https://youtu.be/v4-FUP5Nefk?t=1201) hoping for because  
[0:20:02](https://youtu.be/v4-FUP5Nefk?t=1202) last time we had this conversation you  
[0:20:04](https://youtu.be/v4-FUP5Nefk?t=1204) you spoke you gave a very  
[0:20:06](https://youtu.be/v4-FUP5Nefk?t=1206) very succinct piece of advice and i  
[0:20:08](https://youtu.be/v4-FUP5Nefk?t=1208) actually went viral i'm not sure if you  
[0:20:09](https://youtu.be/v4-FUP5Nefk?t=1209) know  
[0:20:10](https://youtu.be/v4-FUP5Nefk?t=1210) it got like 400 500 000 views or  
[0:20:12](https://youtu.be/v4-FUP5Nefk?t=1212) something like that just how to lose  
[0:20:14](https://youtu.be/v4-FUP5Nefk?t=1214) weight and  
[0:20:15](https://youtu.be/v4-FUP5Nefk?t=1215) people really really enjoyed it and  
[0:20:17](https://youtu.be/v4-FUP5Nefk?t=1217) that's why i think i started  
[0:20:18](https://youtu.be/v4-FUP5Nefk?t=1218) with that this time um i want to talk a  
[0:20:21](https://youtu.be/v4-FUP5Nefk?t=1221) bit about  
[0:20:22](https://youtu.be/v4-FUP5Nefk?t=1222) before we get to self-defense obviously  
[0:20:24](https://youtu.be/v4-FUP5Nefk?t=1224) which is your area of specialism  
[0:20:27](https://youtu.be/v4-FUP5Nefk?t=1227) to  
[0:20:28](https://youtu.be/v4-FUP5Nefk?t=1228) training more generally for people that  
[0:20:30](https://youtu.be/v4-FUP5Nefk?t=1230) may not necessarily be into self-defense  
[0:20:33](https://youtu.be/v4-FUP5Nefk?t=1233) or  
[0:20:34](https://youtu.be/v4-FUP5Nefk?t=1234) may have kind of weakened because of the  
[0:20:37](https://youtu.be/v4-FUP5Nefk?t=1237) years the wear and tear of whatever  
[0:20:39](https://youtu.be/v4-FUP5Nefk?t=1239) they want to get into a gym program just  
[0:20:41](https://youtu.be/v4-FUP5Nefk?t=1241) a normal gym program what would you  
[0:20:43](https://youtu.be/v4-FUP5Nefk?t=1243) recommend for a beginner  
[0:20:45](https://youtu.be/v4-FUP5Nefk?t=1245) i think the number one workout for just  
[0:20:48](https://youtu.be/v4-FUP5Nefk?t=1248) general fitness is a  
[0:20:51](https://youtu.be/v4-FUP5Nefk?t=1251) bag workout a punching bag workout  
[0:20:52](https://youtu.be/v4-FUP5Nefk?t=1252) really it's the ultimate i'll tell you  
[0:20:54](https://youtu.be/v4-FUP5Nefk?t=1254) why  
[0:20:55](https://youtu.be/v4-FUP5Nefk?t=1255) number one you're learning a skill  
[0:20:56](https://youtu.be/v4-FUP5Nefk?t=1256) you're learning how to throw a good  
[0:20:57](https://youtu.be/v4-FUP5Nefk?t=1257) punch  
[0:20:58](https://youtu.be/v4-FUP5Nefk?t=1258) if you get up every day and you hit the  
[0:20:59](https://youtu.be/v4-FUP5Nefk?t=1259) back for a few minutes before you go to  
[0:21:01](https://youtu.be/v4-FUP5Nefk?t=1261) work compare that to somebody who's  
[0:21:03](https://youtu.be/v4-FUP5Nefk?t=1263) running on a treadmill  
[0:21:05](https://youtu.be/v4-FUP5Nefk?t=1265) the guy hitting the bag is going to have  
[0:21:07](https://youtu.be/v4-FUP5Nefk?t=1267) less injury  
[0:21:08](https://youtu.be/v4-FUP5Nefk?t=1268) the guy running  
[0:21:10](https://youtu.be/v4-FUP5Nefk?t=1270) is going to have more injury yeah the  
[0:21:11](https://youtu.be/v4-FUP5Nefk?t=1271) guy hitting the bag is going to have  
[0:21:12](https://youtu.be/v4-FUP5Nefk?t=1272) less inflammation that guy running is  
[0:21:14](https://youtu.be/v4-FUP5Nefk?t=1274) going to have more inflammation the guy  
[0:21:15](https://youtu.be/v4-FUP5Nefk?t=1275) hitting the back is gonna have higher  
[0:21:16](https://youtu.be/v4-FUP5Nefk?t=1276) testosterone the guy running is gonna  
[0:21:17](https://youtu.be/v4-FUP5Nefk?t=1277) have lower testosterone like you beat  
[0:21:18](https://youtu.be/v4-FUP5Nefk?t=1278) him every which way plus if we ever get  
[0:21:20](https://youtu.be/v4-FUP5Nefk?t=1280) into an altercation he's gonna run i'm  
[0:21:22](https://youtu.be/v4-FUP5Nefk?t=1282) not  
[0:21:22](https://youtu.be/v4-FUP5Nefk?t=1282) you know what i mean like you could  
[0:21:23](https://youtu.be/v4-FUP5Nefk?t=1283) throw a good punch you could defend  
[0:21:25](https://youtu.be/v4-FUP5Nefk?t=1285) yourself you're also cultivating a skill  
[0:21:27](https://youtu.be/v4-FUP5Nefk?t=1287) so what i tell people is the thing is  
[0:21:29](https://youtu.be/v4-FUP5Nefk?t=1289) like when you run  
[0:21:31](https://youtu.be/v4-FUP5Nefk?t=1291) you can get overuse injuries especially  
[0:21:32](https://youtu.be/v4-FUP5Nefk?t=1292) if your technique is poor and most  
[0:21:34](https://youtu.be/v4-FUP5Nefk?t=1294) people's running technique is poor  
[0:21:36](https://youtu.be/v4-FUP5Nefk?t=1296) unknowingly  
[0:21:37](https://youtu.be/v4-FUP5Nefk?t=1297) their mechanics have been changed  
[0:21:38](https://youtu.be/v4-FUP5Nefk?t=1298) because they're wearing shoes  
[0:21:40](https://youtu.be/v4-FUP5Nefk?t=1300) if you look at barefoot runners versus  
[0:21:42](https://youtu.be/v4-FUP5Nefk?t=1302) people who learn to run in shoes their  
[0:21:43](https://youtu.be/v4-FUP5Nefk?t=1303) mechanics are different  
[0:21:45](https://youtu.be/v4-FUP5Nefk?t=1305) the best mechanics are those who learn  
[0:21:47](https://youtu.be/v4-FUP5Nefk?t=1307) how to run barefoot third world  
[0:21:48](https://youtu.be/v4-FUP5Nefk?t=1308) countries they're the best at the  
[0:21:49](https://youtu.be/v4-FUP5Nefk?t=1309) kenyans etc  
[0:21:52](https://youtu.be/v4-FUP5Nefk?t=1312) so because we have poor running  
[0:21:54](https://youtu.be/v4-FUP5Nefk?t=1314) mechanics if you run for a prolonged  
[0:21:55](https://youtu.be/v4-FUP5Nefk?t=1315) period of time your knee starts hurting  
[0:21:56](https://youtu.be/v4-FUP5Nefk?t=1316) you your hip starts hurting you i have  
[0:21:57](https://youtu.be/v4-FUP5Nefk?t=1317) one of my students he's an orthopedic  
[0:21:59](https://youtu.be/v4-FUP5Nefk?t=1319) surgeon and i asked him which sport has  
[0:22:00](https://youtu.be/v4-FUP5Nefk?t=1320) the most injuries he said runners  
[0:22:03](https://youtu.be/v4-FUP5Nefk?t=1323) runners it's incredible like they  
[0:22:04](https://youtu.be/v4-FUP5Nefk?t=1324) injured themselves by prolonged running  
[0:22:06](https://youtu.be/v4-FUP5Nefk?t=1326) over years  
[0:22:08](https://youtu.be/v4-FUP5Nefk?t=1328) so when you work the heavy bag but you  
[0:22:10](https://youtu.be/v4-FUP5Nefk?t=1330) need to do it with instruction like for  
[0:22:12](https://youtu.be/v4-FUP5Nefk?t=1332) example you're saying that you learn a  
[0:22:13](https://youtu.be/v4-FUP5Nefk?t=1333) new skill but if the person just doing  
[0:22:14](https://youtu.be/v4-FUP5Nefk?t=1334) on their own volition with their own  
[0:22:16](https://youtu.be/v4-FUP5Nefk?t=1336) devices right yeah they could be kind of  
[0:22:18](https://youtu.be/v4-FUP5Nefk?t=1338) reinforcing bad habits right yeah true  
[0:22:20](https://youtu.be/v4-FUP5Nefk?t=1340) but what's so good about our day and age  
[0:22:21](https://youtu.be/v4-FUP5Nefk?t=1341) is that you can easily get a digital  
[0:22:24](https://youtu.be/v4-FUP5Nefk?t=1344) coach  
[0:22:25](https://youtu.be/v4-FUP5Nefk?t=1345) go on youtube there's a thousand one  
[0:22:26](https://youtu.be/v4-FUP5Nefk?t=1346) tutorials how to jab how to throw right  
[0:22:28](https://youtu.be/v4-FUP5Nefk?t=1348) it's good that because if someone is if  
[0:22:29](https://youtu.be/v4-FUP5Nefk?t=1349) if someone does that say and the person  
[0:22:32](https://youtu.be/v4-FUP5Nefk?t=1352) is not overseeing what they're doing and  
[0:22:33](https://youtu.be/v4-FUP5Nefk?t=1353) then correcting them then is there still  
[0:22:36](https://youtu.be/v4-FUP5Nefk?t=1356) the issue of reinforcement of background  
[0:22:37](https://youtu.be/v4-FUP5Nefk?t=1357) i think over years look if you're  
[0:22:39](https://youtu.be/v4-FUP5Nefk?t=1359) looking to be a world-class boxer then  
[0:22:41](https://youtu.be/v4-FUP5Nefk?t=1361) yeah you need a coach yeah yeah but if  
[0:22:42](https://youtu.be/v4-FUP5Nefk?t=1362) you're just a layman you know if you're  
[0:22:43](https://youtu.be/v4-FUP5Nefk?t=1363) a regular joe learning just getting in  
[0:22:45](https://youtu.be/v4-FUP5Nefk?t=1365) shape i think it's more than enough a  
[0:22:46](https://youtu.be/v4-FUP5Nefk?t=1366) digital tutorial is plenty but what i  
[0:22:48](https://youtu.be/v4-FUP5Nefk?t=1368) see a lot of is a lot of people that go  
[0:22:50](https://youtu.be/v4-FUP5Nefk?t=1370) into personal training and get personal  
[0:22:51](https://youtu.be/v4-FUP5Nefk?t=1371) trainers and they do like pad work and  
[0:22:53](https://youtu.be/v4-FUP5Nefk?t=1373) stuff and the personal trainer is not a  
[0:22:56](https://youtu.be/v4-FUP5Nefk?t=1376) trained martial artist so he will teach  
[0:22:57](https://youtu.be/v4-FUP5Nefk?t=1377) the client  
[0:22:59](https://youtu.be/v4-FUP5Nefk?t=1379) a technique which is not a correct one  
[0:23:01](https://youtu.be/v4-FUP5Nefk?t=1381) could that be more harmful than good i  
[0:23:03](https://youtu.be/v4-FUP5Nefk?t=1383) think there are levels of instructors  
[0:23:05](https://youtu.be/v4-FUP5Nefk?t=1385) some can do more harm than good but the  
[0:23:06](https://youtu.be/v4-FUP5Nefk?t=1386) vast majority boxing is a known art like  
[0:23:08](https://youtu.be/v4-FUP5Nefk?t=1388) if you go around the world they have  
[0:23:09](https://youtu.be/v4-FUP5Nefk?t=1389) boxing yeah yeah and there are different  
[0:23:10](https://youtu.be/v4-FUP5Nefk?t=1390) levels of boxing instruction but it's  
[0:23:12](https://youtu.be/v4-FUP5Nefk?t=1392) fairly good yes so i would say you know  
[0:23:15](https://youtu.be/v4-FUP5Nefk?t=1395) find yourself a a a reputable instructor  
[0:23:18](https://youtu.be/v4-FUP5Nefk?t=1398) online are you saying boxing are you  
[0:23:19](https://youtu.be/v4-FUP5Nefk?t=1399) saying kickboxing  
[0:23:20](https://youtu.be/v4-FUP5Nefk?t=1400) both i would start with boxing graduate  
[0:23:22](https://youtu.be/v4-FUP5Nefk?t=1402) to kickboxing go to muay thai  
[0:23:24](https://youtu.be/v4-FUP5Nefk?t=1404) because the thing is with punching bag  
[0:23:25](https://youtu.be/v4-FUP5Nefk?t=1405) you can you can you don't even have to  
[0:23:27](https://youtu.be/v4-FUP5Nefk?t=1407) hit the bag hard let's say your  
[0:23:28](https://youtu.be/v4-FUP5Nefk?t=1408) shoulders are sore just kind of you can  
[0:23:30](https://youtu.be/v4-FUP5Nefk?t=1410) even shadow box zero impact very good  
[0:23:32](https://youtu.be/v4-FUP5Nefk?t=1412) cardio yep and i like to mix bag work  
[0:23:34](https://youtu.be/v4-FUP5Nefk?t=1414) with calisthenics right so i like to do  
[0:23:36](https://youtu.be/v4-FUP5Nefk?t=1416) one minute hitting the bag one minute  
[0:23:38](https://youtu.be/v4-FUP5Nefk?t=1418) swinging a kettlebell so i put on mma  
[0:23:39](https://youtu.be/v4-FUP5Nefk?t=1419) gloves so i can swing the kettlebell one  
[0:23:41](https://youtu.be/v4-FUP5Nefk?t=1421) minute hitting the back one minute  
[0:23:42](https://youtu.be/v4-FUP5Nefk?t=1422) getting ball i do that for maybe six  
[0:23:44](https://youtu.be/v4-FUP5Nefk?t=1424) minutes take a break  
[0:23:45](https://youtu.be/v4-FUP5Nefk?t=1425) repeat it one more time  
[0:23:47](https://youtu.be/v4-FUP5Nefk?t=1427) and then like even kettlebell might be a  
[0:23:49](https://youtu.be/v4-FUP5Nefk?t=1429) little bit for some okay do push ups and  
[0:23:50](https://youtu.be/v4-FUP5Nefk?t=1430) squats one minute exercise one minute  
[0:23:52](https://youtu.be/v4-FUP5Nefk?t=1432) hitting the back one minute exercise one  
[0:23:54](https://youtu.be/v4-FUP5Nefk?t=1434) it's a phenomenal workout what about  
[0:23:56](https://youtu.be/v4-FUP5Nefk?t=1436) when you're sorry to cut your hair oh no  
[0:23:57](https://youtu.be/v4-FUP5Nefk?t=1437) please but you know when you said shadow  
[0:23:59](https://youtu.be/v4-FUP5Nefk?t=1439) boxing right when you're when you're  
[0:24:01](https://youtu.be/v4-FUP5Nefk?t=1441) doing that  
[0:24:02](https://youtu.be/v4-FUP5Nefk?t=1442) before you start the round are you  
[0:24:03](https://youtu.be/v4-FUP5Nefk?t=1443) thinking this is what i want to  
[0:24:04](https://youtu.be/v4-FUP5Nefk?t=1444) establish in my shadow boxing round i  
[0:24:06](https://youtu.be/v4-FUP5Nefk?t=1446) want to establish a jab in the right  
[0:24:08](https://youtu.be/v4-FUP5Nefk?t=1448) hand i wanted to establish like or are  
[0:24:10](https://youtu.be/v4-FUP5Nefk?t=1450) you just doing it haphazardly sometimes  
[0:24:13](https://youtu.be/v4-FUP5Nefk?t=1453) i'll watch a fight and i'll see a guy do  
[0:24:14](https://youtu.be/v4-FUP5Nefk?t=1454) a nice sequence and that's what i'm  
[0:24:15](https://youtu.be/v4-FUP5Nefk?t=1455) excited to work on tomorrow okay you  
[0:24:17](https://youtu.be/v4-FUP5Nefk?t=1457) know i mean i'm just gonna maybe work my  
[0:24:18](https://youtu.be/v4-FUP5Nefk?t=1458) job today okay now my uppercase there's  
[0:24:20](https://youtu.be/v4-FUP5Nefk?t=1460) so much to work on there's so much to  
[0:24:22](https://youtu.be/v4-FUP5Nefk?t=1462) there's so much to cultivate that that's  
[0:24:23](https://youtu.be/v4-FUP5Nefk?t=1463) the fun part you get in your workout and  
[0:24:25](https://youtu.be/v4-FUP5Nefk?t=1465) then after a while you wanna spar  
[0:24:27](https://youtu.be/v4-FUP5Nefk?t=1467) sparring is the funnest why because  
[0:24:29](https://youtu.be/v4-FUP5Nefk?t=1469) three rounds of sparring is  
[0:24:31](https://youtu.be/v4-FUP5Nefk?t=1471) incredibly uh demanding on the body and  
[0:24:34](https://youtu.be/v4-FUP5Nefk?t=1474) the time passes like this like i could  
[0:24:36](https://youtu.be/v4-FUP5Nefk?t=1476) run forever i just get the reason why i  
[0:24:38](https://youtu.be/v4-FUP5Nefk?t=1478) stopped running is i'm bored  
[0:24:39](https://youtu.be/v4-FUP5Nefk?t=1479) running is easy for me like if you're  
[0:24:40](https://youtu.be/v4-FUP5Nefk?t=1480) telling me jogging jogging doesn't do  
[0:24:42](https://youtu.be/v4-FUP5Nefk?t=1482) anything to me like it'll make me sweat  
[0:24:44](https://youtu.be/v4-FUP5Nefk?t=1484) yes but it won't fatigue me because it's  
[0:24:46](https://youtu.be/v4-FUP5Nefk?t=1486) so much more  
[0:24:47](https://youtu.be/v4-FUP5Nefk?t=1487) the intensity is so much lower than what  
[0:24:49](https://youtu.be/v4-FUP5Nefk?t=1489) i'm used to doing  
[0:24:50](https://youtu.be/v4-FUP5Nefk?t=1490) however i will get bored running unless  
[0:24:52](https://youtu.be/v4-FUP5Nefk?t=1492) i'm listening to a good podcast or  
[0:24:54](https://youtu.be/v4-FUP5Nefk?t=1494) something i'll get bored running  
[0:24:56](https://youtu.be/v4-FUP5Nefk?t=1496) so it's boring it's i find it very  
[0:24:58](https://youtu.be/v4-FUP5Nefk?t=1498) boring and it's not good for your your  
[0:24:59](https://youtu.be/v4-FUP5Nefk?t=1499) body  
[0:25:00](https://youtu.be/v4-FUP5Nefk?t=1500) especially for heavier people right yeah  
[0:25:02](https://youtu.be/v4-FUP5Nefk?t=1502) exactly i like to run in a short burst  
[0:25:04](https://youtu.be/v4-FUP5Nefk?t=1504) like i like to do 100 meter sprints okay  
[0:25:05](https://youtu.be/v4-FUP5Nefk?t=1505) it's done i did it in 20 minutes it was  
[0:25:07](https://youtu.be/v4-FUP5Nefk?t=1507) painful but short  
[0:25:09](https://youtu.be/v4-FUP5Nefk?t=1509) that i enjoy  
[0:25:10](https://youtu.be/v4-FUP5Nefk?t=1510) however boxing i have a bla have fun

[0:25:21](https://youtu.be/v4-FUP5Nefk?t=1521) passes we should actually say that

[0:25:52](https://youtu.be/v4-FUP5Nefk?t=1552) kind of rearing us to the next part of  
[0:25:54](https://youtu.be/v4-FUP5Nefk?t=1554) this discussion which is  
[0:25:55](https://youtu.be/v4-FUP5Nefk?t=1555) the basics of self-defense  
[0:25:57](https://youtu.be/v4-FUP5Nefk?t=1557) maybe we can not now after this because  
[0:26:00](https://youtu.be/v4-FUP5Nefk?t=1560) you can show maybe some some

[0:26:02](https://youtu.be/v4-FUP5Nefk?t=1562) else we could do over here  
[0:26:04](https://youtu.be/v4-FUP5Nefk?t=1564) but you know  
[0:26:06](https://youtu.be/v4-FUP5Nefk?t=1566) how important is it  
[0:26:08](https://youtu.be/v4-FUP5Nefk?t=1568) i couldn't imagine myself without my  
[0:26:10](https://youtu.be/v4-FUP5Nefk?t=1570) martial arts skill i was so bullied as a  
[0:26:12](https://youtu.be/v4-FUP5Nefk?t=1572) kid that boy yeah definitely i had two  
[0:26:15](https://youtu.be/v4-FUP5Nefk?t=1575) older brothers i was small when i was  
[0:26:16](https://youtu.be/v4-FUP5Nefk?t=1576) growing up i was smaller than everybody  
[0:26:18](https://youtu.be/v4-FUP5Nefk?t=1578) so i got picked on a lot so martial arts  
[0:26:20](https://youtu.be/v4-FUP5Nefk?t=1580) really carved a part of my my my psyche  
[0:26:23](https://youtu.be/v4-FUP5Nefk?t=1583) could like i needed it so much and now  
[0:26:25](https://youtu.be/v4-FUP5Nefk?t=1585) you've become you know what you are now  
[0:26:27](https://youtu.be/v4-FUP5Nefk?t=1587) just so  
[0:26:28](https://youtu.be/v4-FUP5Nefk?t=1588) i was watching a video of yours sparring  
[0:26:30](https://youtu.be/v4-FUP5Nefk?t=1590) with i mentioned this with you some some  
[0:26:32](https://youtu.be/v4-FUP5Nefk?t=1592) huge guy  
[0:26:35](https://youtu.be/v4-FUP5Nefk?t=1595) the guy was the the strongest arm or  
[0:26:38](https://youtu.be/v4-FUP5Nefk?t=1598) something like that at one point he's  
[0:26:40](https://youtu.be/v4-FUP5Nefk?t=1600) world champion right hand and left hand  
[0:26:41](https://youtu.be/v4-FUP5Nefk?t=1601) really yeah both hands at one point he  
[0:26:44](https://youtu.be/v4-FUP5Nefk?t=1604) you know he gone you i don't know who  
[0:26:45](https://youtu.be/v4-FUP5Nefk?t=1605) got on top of him you got on top of him  
[0:26:47](https://youtu.be/v4-FUP5Nefk?t=1607) and his arm was there and you were  
[0:26:49](https://youtu.be/v4-FUP5Nefk?t=1609) commenting on the videos like and if  
[0:26:51](https://youtu.be/v4-FUP5Nefk?t=1611) there goes the world's strongest arm  
[0:26:55](https://youtu.be/v4-FUP5Nefk?t=1615) and then you got him in the hill hook  
[0:26:57](https://youtu.be/v4-FUP5Nefk?t=1617) position isn't it yeah like yeah yeah  
[0:26:59](https://youtu.be/v4-FUP5Nefk?t=1619) which many people will not know what  
[0:27:00](https://youtu.be/v4-FUP5Nefk?t=1620) we're talking about but you obviously  
[0:27:02](https://youtu.be/v4-FUP5Nefk?t=1622) you have  
[0:27:03](https://youtu.be/v4-FUP5Nefk?t=1623) graduated from the school of danah who's  
[0:27:05](https://youtu.be/v4-FUP5Nefk?t=1625) like you know well known for  
[0:27:07](https://youtu.be/v4-FUP5Nefk?t=1627) you know legs  
[0:27:09](https://youtu.be/v4-FUP5Nefk?t=1629) and it's just so amazing to be honest  
[0:27:11](https://youtu.be/v4-FUP5Nefk?t=1631) for me anyway  
[0:27:12](https://youtu.be/v4-FUP5Nefk?t=1632) to be able to see that someone who if it  
[0:27:15](https://youtu.be/v4-FUP5Nefk?t=1635) was a boxing affair and both were like  
[0:27:18](https://youtu.be/v4-FUP5Nefk?t=1638) it wouldn't be the same but because  
[0:27:20](https://youtu.be/v4-FUP5Nefk?t=1640) you're able to get the weakest part to  
[0:27:22](https://youtu.be/v4-FUP5Nefk?t=1642) use dana has language right the weakest  
[0:27:24](https://youtu.be/v4-FUP5Nefk?t=1644) part of the opponent's body and the  
[0:27:25](https://youtu.be/v4-FUP5Nefk?t=1645) strongest part of your own  
[0:27:27](https://youtu.be/v4-FUP5Nefk?t=1647) you're able to get someone who could be  
[0:27:29](https://youtu.be/v4-FUP5Nefk?t=1649) almost double your size in terms of  
[0:27:31](https://youtu.be/v4-FUP5Nefk?t=1651) weight i don't know how you had at least  
[0:27:32](https://youtu.be/v4-FUP5Nefk?t=1652) 100 pounds on you or something like that  
[0:27:34](https://youtu.be/v4-FUP5Nefk?t=1654) into a position of  
[0:27:36](https://youtu.be/v4-FUP5Nefk?t=1656) subordination  
[0:27:38](https://youtu.be/v4-FUP5Nefk?t=1658) you know i mean if i tried to arm  
[0:27:40](https://youtu.be/v4-FUP5Nefk?t=1660) wrestle him he'd rip my arm out of out  
[0:27:41](https://youtu.be/v4-FUP5Nefk?t=1661) of the socket like he's so much stronger  
[0:27:43](https://youtu.be/v4-FUP5Nefk?t=1663) than me like we play arm wrestle then i  
[0:27:45](https://youtu.be/v4-FUP5Nefk?t=1665) could just see like his hand i feel like  
[0:27:46](https://youtu.be/v4-FUP5Nefk?t=1666) a child you know i'm holding a no but  
[0:27:48](https://youtu.be/v4-FUP5Nefk?t=1668) that's the point that someone's so  
[0:27:49](https://youtu.be/v4-FUP5Nefk?t=1669) strong he's incredible his power is  
[0:27:51](https://youtu.be/v4-FUP5Nefk?t=1671) incredible his physical look during that  
[0:27:53](https://youtu.be/v4-FUP5Nefk?t=1673) time i i as we first started resting i  
[0:27:55](https://youtu.be/v4-FUP5Nefk?t=1675) went on his back and i couldn't put my  
[0:27:57](https://youtu.be/v4-FUP5Nefk?t=1677) legs around his back and he was grabbing  
[0:27:59](https://youtu.be/v4-FUP5Nefk?t=1679) my arm and i knew like like i understood  
[0:28:01](https://youtu.be/v4-FUP5Nefk?t=1681) right away what submission i have to get  
[0:28:03](https://youtu.be/v4-FUP5Nefk?t=1683) to i have to isolate his ankle and get  
[0:28:05](https://youtu.be/v4-FUP5Nefk?t=1685) to that ankle and you didn't think about  
[0:28:06](https://youtu.be/v4-FUP5Nefk?t=1686) any other moves no i i think it's i  
[0:28:09](https://youtu.be/v4-FUP5Nefk?t=1689) think it would be  
[0:28:11](https://youtu.be/v4-FUP5Nefk?t=1691) every other submission is very risky  
[0:28:13](https://youtu.be/v4-FUP5Nefk?t=1693) very risky for me  
[0:28:15](https://youtu.be/v4-FUP5Nefk?t=1695) and the the leg lock is the one that's  
[0:28:18](https://youtu.be/v4-FUP5Nefk?t=1698) super super almost impossible for him to  
[0:28:20](https://youtu.be/v4-FUP5Nefk?t=1700) defend and super easy for me to access  
[0:28:23](https://youtu.be/v4-FUP5Nefk?t=1703) so it's it's because the thing is the  
[0:28:25](https://youtu.be/v4-FUP5Nefk?t=1705) bigger they are the easier they are to  
[0:28:26](https://youtu.be/v4-FUP5Nefk?t=1706) leg lock you have you can have much more  
[0:28:28](https://youtu.be/v4-FUP5Nefk?t=1708) trouble leg locking somebody your size  
[0:28:29](https://youtu.be/v4-FUP5Nefk?t=1709) than somebody who's much bigger because  
[0:28:31](https://youtu.be/v4-FUP5Nefk?t=1711) the foot is this big it's such an easy  
[0:28:33](https://youtu.be/v4-FUP5Nefk?t=1713) lever for me to hook on to whereas the  
[0:28:35](https://youtu.be/v4-FUP5Nefk?t=1715) guy has a size a normal size foot it's  
[0:28:37](https://youtu.be/v4-FUP5Nefk?t=1717) very hard so someone's like myself what  
[0:28:38](https://youtu.be/v4-FUP5Nefk?t=1718) should i do to avoid my  
[0:28:40](https://youtu.be/v4-FUP5Nefk?t=1720) [Laughter]  
[0:28:41](https://youtu.be/v4-FUP5Nefk?t=1721) you know what i'm going for forever  
[0:28:48](https://youtu.be/v4-FUP5Nefk?t=1728) don't let the guy get there so you see  
[0:28:50](https://youtu.be/v4-FUP5Nefk?t=1730) like uh like as we're engaging trying to  
[0:28:53](https://youtu.be/v4-FUP5Nefk?t=1733) lift him would be ludicrous so because  
[0:28:55](https://youtu.be/v4-FUP5Nefk?t=1735) he's so tall it's easy for me to slide  
[0:28:56](https://youtu.be/v4-FUP5Nefk?t=1736) underneath so into a minority or  
[0:28:58](https://youtu.be/v4-FUP5Nefk?t=1738) something like that yeah yeah but  
[0:28:59](https://youtu.be/v4-FUP5Nefk?t=1739) actually i didn't use a minority i used  
[0:29:00](https://youtu.be/v4-FUP5Nefk?t=1740) this ashy slide which is a slide  
[0:29:02](https://youtu.be/v4-FUP5Nefk?t=1742) underneath straight into a leg lock so  
[0:29:04](https://youtu.be/v4-FUP5Nefk?t=1744) there's no resistance there's no there's  
[0:29:06](https://youtu.be/v4-FUP5Nefk?t=1746) no lifting there's no there's no i'm not  
[0:29:08](https://youtu.be/v4-FUP5Nefk?t=1748) exposing my neck because you know when  
[0:29:09](https://youtu.be/v4-FUP5Nefk?t=1749) you shoot a double leg you're exposing  
[0:29:10](https://youtu.be/v4-FUP5Nefk?t=1750) your neck  
[0:29:11](https://youtu.be/v4-FUP5Nefk?t=1751) like there's just so many dangers if he  
[0:29:12](https://youtu.be/v4-FUP5Nefk?t=1752) puts his weight on he could hurt my back  
[0:29:14](https://youtu.be/v4-FUP5Nefk?t=1754) so  
[0:29:15](https://youtu.be/v4-FUP5Nefk?t=1755) it's you have to ask yourself what is  
[0:29:17](https://youtu.be/v4-FUP5Nefk?t=1757) the  
[0:29:18](https://youtu.be/v4-FUP5Nefk?t=1758) what is the easiest way for me to attack  
[0:29:21](https://youtu.be/v4-FUP5Nefk?t=1761) him from safety a position of safety and  
[0:29:23](https://youtu.be/v4-FUP5Nefk?t=1763) it's for in that situation not all  
[0:29:25](https://youtu.be/v4-FUP5Nefk?t=1765) not all situations are the same if i was  
[0:29:27](https://youtu.be/v4-FUP5Nefk?t=1767) fighting somebody my size i would use  
[0:29:28](https://youtu.be/v4-FUP5Nefk?t=1768) different tactics oh is it yeah yeah  
[0:29:30](https://youtu.be/v4-FUP5Nefk?t=1770) absolutely because he's so tall it's  
[0:29:32](https://youtu.be/v4-FUP5Nefk?t=1772) very he's very vulnerable for an ashy  
[0:29:33](https://youtu.be/v4-FUP5Nefk?t=1773) slide  
[0:29:34](https://youtu.be/v4-FUP5Nefk?t=1774) so what should he do then just so i know  
[0:29:37](https://youtu.be/v4-FUP5Nefk?t=1777) for reference  
[0:29:40](https://youtu.be/v4-FUP5Nefk?t=1780) he's gotta not let me get  
[0:29:42](https://youtu.be/v4-FUP5Nefk?t=1782) like he he'd have to he'd have to  
[0:29:45](https://youtu.be/v4-FUP5Nefk?t=1785) he'd have to control my grip so that i  
[0:29:46](https://youtu.be/v4-FUP5Nefk?t=1786) cannot actually slide which would be  
[0:29:48](https://youtu.be/v4-FUP5Nefk?t=1788) complicated to explain okay okay you  
[0:29:50](https://youtu.be/v4-FUP5Nefk?t=1790) have to fight my grip so that i cannot  
[0:29:51](https://youtu.be/v4-FUP5Nefk?t=1791) grab him in a way that i can actually  
[0:29:53](https://youtu.be/v4-FUP5Nefk?t=1793) slide but then there's other things i  
[0:29:54](https://youtu.be/v4-FUP5Nefk?t=1794) can do if he if he does that you know  
[0:29:56](https://youtu.be/v4-FUP5Nefk?t=1796) it's a we're playing chess you know yeah  
[0:29:58](https://youtu.be/v4-FUP5Nefk?t=1798) and of course he's being a great sport  
[0:29:59](https://youtu.be/v4-FUP5Nefk?t=1799) you know he's uh he's we're just playing  
[0:30:01](https://youtu.be/v4-FUP5Nefk?t=1801) obviously i'm not going super hard he's  
[0:30:02](https://youtu.be/v4-FUP5Nefk?t=1802) not going super cool but we're still  
[0:30:03](https://youtu.be/v4-FUP5Nefk?t=1803) we're still getting nevertheless we're  
[0:30:05](https://youtu.be/v4-FUP5Nefk?t=1805) still getting each other  
[0:30:06](https://youtu.be/v4-FUP5Nefk?t=1806) just to give people a kind of a taste of  
[0:30:08](https://youtu.be/v4-FUP5Nefk?t=1808) this because people look at the heel  
[0:30:10](https://youtu.be/v4-FUP5Nefk?t=1810) hook that might and they don't know what  
[0:30:11](https://youtu.be/v4-FUP5Nefk?t=1811) the ramifications of it are the  
[0:30:13](https://youtu.be/v4-FUP5Nefk?t=1813) implications are if you finish it and if  
[0:30:15](https://youtu.be/v4-FUP5Nefk?t=1815) there's nobody to stop it you're  
[0:30:16](https://youtu.be/v4-FUP5Nefk?t=1816) destroying the man for life you're  
[0:30:18](https://youtu.be/v4-FUP5Nefk?t=1818) breaking the case irreversible damage  
[0:30:20](https://youtu.be/v4-FUP5Nefk?t=1820) right it's very dangerous on the knee  
[0:30:21](https://youtu.be/v4-FUP5Nefk?t=1821) like it's you could you can have it  
[0:30:23](https://youtu.be/v4-FUP5Nefk?t=1823) repaired but your knee might never be  
[0:30:24](https://youtu.be/v4-FUP5Nefk?t=1824) the same either you know so yeah it's uh  
[0:30:26](https://youtu.be/v4-FUP5Nefk?t=1826) it's a nasty some promotions actually  
[0:30:28](https://youtu.be/v4-FUP5Nefk?t=1828) had banned the heel hook right  
[0:30:30](https://youtu.be/v4-FUP5Nefk?t=1830) in all of ibjf heel hooks are illegal  
[0:30:32](https://youtu.be/v4-FUP5Nefk?t=1832) yeah until very recently in nogi and in  
[0:30:35](https://youtu.be/v4-FUP5Nefk?t=1835) the higher divisions only brown on black  
[0:30:36](https://youtu.be/v4-FUP5Nefk?t=1836) or something yeah brown and black but  
[0:30:37](https://youtu.be/v4-FUP5Nefk?t=1837) yeah but for many years it was frowned  
[0:30:39](https://youtu.be/v4-FUP5Nefk?t=1839) upon because it's considered so  
[0:30:40](https://youtu.be/v4-FUP5Nefk?t=1840) dangerous yeah  
[0:30:42](https://youtu.be/v4-FUP5Nefk?t=1842) and you can injure something the thing  
[0:30:43](https://youtu.be/v4-FUP5Nefk?t=1843) is when you injure your knee it's funny  
[0:30:44](https://youtu.be/v4-FUP5Nefk?t=1844) because i actually just released a video  
[0:30:47](https://youtu.be/v4-FUP5Nefk?t=1847) called strong and stable for life yeah  
[0:30:49](https://youtu.be/v4-FUP5Nefk?t=1849) and strong and stable needs for life and  
[0:30:51](https://youtu.be/v4-FUP5Nefk?t=1851) the reason why i did it is because  
[0:30:52](https://youtu.be/v4-FUP5Nefk?t=1852) that's the number one question i get all  
[0:30:53](https://youtu.be/v4-FUP5Nefk?t=1853) the time so i'm like you know what  
[0:30:55](https://youtu.be/v4-FUP5Nefk?t=1855) i'm gonna do it because well i'm on the  
[0:30:56](https://youtu.be/v4-FUP5Nefk?t=1856) mats i always have somebody tap me on  
[0:30:57](https://youtu.be/v4-FUP5Nefk?t=1857) the shoulder and tell me hey coach i  
[0:30:59](https://youtu.be/v4-FUP5Nefk?t=1859) have a knee injury what do i do i heard  
[0:31:00](https://youtu.be/v4-FUP5Nefk?t=1860) you  
[0:31:02](https://youtu.be/v4-FUP5Nefk?t=1862) you're you know you can fix my knee and  
[0:31:04](https://youtu.be/v4-FUP5Nefk?t=1864) then i go through the whole spiel oh as  
[0:31:06](https://youtu.be/v4-FUP5Nefk?t=1866) i said you know what let me put it on  
[0:31:07](https://youtu.be/v4-FUP5Nefk?t=1867) tape got that on your channel yeah let  
[0:31:08](https://youtu.be/v4-FUP5Nefk?t=1868) me let me get it on tape and now from  
[0:31:10](https://youtu.be/v4-FUP5Nefk?t=1870) now on i'm just going to give it to my  
[0:31:11](https://youtu.be/v4-FUP5Nefk?t=1871) members is it is it on the dude  
[0:31:15](https://youtu.be/v4-FUP5Nefk?t=1875) it's uh knees are so important because  
[0:31:17](https://youtu.be/v4-FUP5Nefk?t=1877) here's the problem with knees  
[0:31:18](https://youtu.be/v4-FUP5Nefk?t=1878) if you injure your knee like a serious  
[0:31:20](https://youtu.be/v4-FUP5Nefk?t=1880) injury like an acl tear yep on average  
[0:31:22](https://youtu.be/v4-FUP5Nefk?t=1882) two years later the other acl goes  
[0:31:25](https://youtu.be/v4-FUP5Nefk?t=1885) why they explain they explain to us that  
[0:31:27](https://youtu.be/v4-FUP5Nefk?t=1887) your your body overcompensates one side  
[0:31:30](https://youtu.be/v4-FUP5Nefk?t=1890) so what happens you never recalibrate  
[0:31:32](https://youtu.be/v4-FUP5Nefk?t=1892) your joint your legs like they were  
[0:31:34](https://youtu.be/v4-FUP5Nefk?t=1894) before so for instance if i injure  
[0:31:36](https://youtu.be/v4-FUP5Nefk?t=1896) my shoulder i can go under the knife  
[0:31:38](https://youtu.be/v4-FUP5Nefk?t=1898) but that doesn't affect my left shoulder  
[0:31:40](https://youtu.be/v4-FUP5Nefk?t=1900) yeah if i injure my right doesn't affect  
[0:31:41](https://youtu.be/v4-FUP5Nefk?t=1901) my left but when it comes to the knees  
[0:31:43](https://youtu.be/v4-FUP5Nefk?t=1903) because your knees your legs are  
[0:31:44](https://youtu.be/v4-FUP5Nefk?t=1904) carrying your body they have a certain  
[0:31:46](https://youtu.be/v4-FUP5Nefk?t=1906) calibration between the two when you  
[0:31:48](https://youtu.be/v4-FUP5Nefk?t=1908) injure one the other one takes over so  
[0:31:49](https://youtu.be/v4-FUP5Nefk?t=1909) what happens you're overusing the one  
[0:31:50](https://youtu.be/v4-FUP5Nefk?t=1910) that's compensating  
[0:31:52](https://youtu.be/v4-FUP5Nefk?t=1912) so on average there's a tariff the  
[0:31:54](https://youtu.be/v4-FUP5Nefk?t=1914) second one now when george tore his acl  
[0:31:56](https://youtu.be/v4-FUP5Nefk?t=1916) we knew about this they warned us we  
[0:31:57](https://youtu.be/v4-FUP5Nefk?t=1917) brought in every expert to make sure  
[0:31:59](https://youtu.be/v4-FUP5Nefk?t=1919) that his acl the second one doesn't  
[0:32:01](https://youtu.be/v4-FUP5Nefk?t=1921) break because it costs us a pretty penny  
[0:32:04](https://youtu.be/v4-FUP5Nefk?t=1924) and he's in the height of his career now  
[0:32:05](https://youtu.be/v4-FUP5Nefk?t=1925) we want to you know keep him as healthy  
[0:32:07](https://youtu.be/v4-FUP5Nefk?t=1927) as possible  
[0:32:08](https://youtu.be/v4-FUP5Nefk?t=1928) still it broke  
[0:32:09](https://youtu.be/v4-FUP5Nefk?t=1929) and it broke the second acl broke and it  
[0:32:11](https://youtu.be/v4-FUP5Nefk?t=1931) wasn't like a very intense wrestling he  
[0:32:14](https://youtu.be/v4-FUP5Nefk?t=1934) wasn't wrestling like usual  
[0:32:16](https://youtu.be/v4-FUP5Nefk?t=1936) but his knee failed and it was a scary  
[0:32:18](https://youtu.be/v4-FUP5Nefk?t=1938) thing because now he broke a trust with  
[0:32:20](https://youtu.be/v4-FUP5Nefk?t=1940) his knees like he doesn't trust his  
[0:32:21](https://youtu.be/v4-FUP5Nefk?t=1941) knees like he used to wow  
[0:32:24](https://youtu.be/v4-FUP5Nefk?t=1944) so we had to rebuild him physically and  
[0:32:25](https://youtu.be/v4-FUP5Nefk?t=1945) psychologically to retrust his knees  
[0:32:27](https://youtu.be/v4-FUP5Nefk?t=1947) again and he fought two world titles  
[0:32:29](https://youtu.be/v4-FUP5Nefk?t=1949) after that successfully  
[0:32:31](https://youtu.be/v4-FUP5Nefk?t=1951) but again there's a distrust with the  
[0:32:32](https://youtu.be/v4-FUP5Nefk?t=1952) knees because don't forget you're  
[0:32:33](https://youtu.be/v4-FUP5Nefk?t=1953) applying all your weight and the weight  
[0:32:35](https://youtu.be/v4-FUP5Nefk?t=1955) of your opponent sometimes when you lift  
[0:32:36](https://youtu.be/v4-FUP5Nefk?t=1956) your opponent it's your weight and his  
[0:32:37](https://youtu.be/v4-FUP5Nefk?t=1957) weight on your knees  
[0:32:39](https://youtu.be/v4-FUP5Nefk?t=1959) it's not the same thing with the  
[0:32:40](https://youtu.be/v4-FUP5Nefk?t=1960) shoulder you don't rely on your  
[0:32:41](https://youtu.be/v4-FUP5Nefk?t=1961) shoulders as much as you rely on your  
[0:32:43](https://youtu.be/v4-FUP5Nefk?t=1963) knees your knees are so  
[0:32:45](https://youtu.be/v4-FUP5Nefk?t=1965) important because of the base of your  
[0:32:47](https://youtu.be/v4-FUP5Nefk?t=1967) power every time you generate power  
[0:32:49](https://youtu.be/v4-FUP5Nefk?t=1969) whether you throw a punch  
[0:32:51](https://youtu.be/v4-FUP5Nefk?t=1971) you're using your legs your posterior  
[0:32:52](https://youtu.be/v4-FUP5Nefk?t=1972) chain it starts with the feet knees and  
[0:32:55](https://youtu.be/v4-FUP5Nefk?t=1975) hips and it goes up the shoulder  
[0:32:58](https://youtu.be/v4-FUP5Nefk?t=1978) does  
[0:32:59](https://youtu.be/v4-FUP5Nefk?t=1979) does definitely uh  
[0:33:01](https://youtu.be/v4-FUP5Nefk?t=1981) contribute to the kinetic chain however  
[0:33:03](https://youtu.be/v4-FUP5Nefk?t=1983) it's not as fundamental  
[0:33:06](https://youtu.be/v4-FUP5Nefk?t=1986) and it's not carrying as much stress  
[0:33:08](https://youtu.be/v4-FUP5Nefk?t=1988) and it doesn't rely we don't rely on the  
[0:33:10](https://youtu.be/v4-FUP5Nefk?t=1990) sensitivity of calibration my shoulders  
[0:33:12](https://youtu.be/v4-FUP5Nefk?t=1992) don't need to be calibrated as  
[0:33:13](https://youtu.be/v4-FUP5Nefk?t=1993) sensitively as my knees so all these  
[0:33:15](https://youtu.be/v4-FUP5Nefk?t=1995) problems i tell like i i wrestle every  
[0:33:17](https://youtu.be/v4-FUP5Nefk?t=1997) day twice a day i do mma doubles  
[0:33:20](https://youtu.be/v4-FUP5Nefk?t=2000) the most brutal sport mma yeah and i've  
[0:33:22](https://youtu.be/v4-FUP5Nefk?t=2002) never torn an ac alhamdulillah inshallah  
[0:33:25](https://youtu.be/v4-FUP5Nefk?t=2005) i never do i've never torn acl why  
[0:33:27](https://youtu.be/v4-FUP5Nefk?t=2007) i'm very

[0:33:58](https://youtu.be/v4-FUP5Nefk?t=2038) i you know i learned that teaching  
[0:34:00](https://youtu.be/v4-FUP5Nefk?t=2040) giving a good name a memorable name to  
[0:34:01](https://youtu.be/v4-FUP5Nefk?t=2041) things is it's good for a point of  
[0:34:04](https://youtu.be/v4-FUP5Nefk?t=2044) reference what you're talking about the  
[0:34:05](https://youtu.be/v4-FUP5Nefk?t=2045) strongest arm in the world  
[0:34:08](https://youtu.be/v4-FUP5Nefk?t=2048) it's almost like an exotic novel it's  
[0:34:10](https://youtu.be/v4-FUP5Nefk?t=2050) important it's important i want my  
[0:34:11](https://youtu.be/v4-FUP5Nefk?t=2051) students to know exactly what i'm  
[0:34:12](https://youtu.be/v4-FUP5Nefk?t=2052) pinpointing yeah and uh  
[0:34:15](https://youtu.be/v4-FUP5Nefk?t=2055) like i i'll jump up on a stability ball  
[0:34:17](https://youtu.be/v4-FUP5Nefk?t=2057) but just to demonstrate the stability  
[0:34:19](https://youtu.be/v4-FUP5Nefk?t=2059) i've built over the years  
[0:34:21](https://youtu.be/v4-FUP5Nefk?t=2061) not that i would do that as an exercise  
[0:34:23](https://youtu.be/v4-FUP5Nefk?t=2063) that's highly dangerous you know what  
[0:34:24](https://youtu.be/v4-FUP5Nefk?t=2064) what forbidden  
[0:34:26](https://youtu.be/v4-FUP5Nefk?t=2066) you'll break your neck i'm going to get  
[0:34:27](https://youtu.be/v4-FUP5Nefk?t=2067) a thousand one in the lawsuits if i you  
[0:34:29](https://youtu.be/v4-FUP5Nefk?t=2069) know that's why i named it that to make  
[0:34:30](https://youtu.be/v4-FUP5Nefk?t=2070) sure that if i'm ever in court i'm like  
[0:34:32](https://youtu.be/v4-FUP5Nefk?t=2072) hey i told it was forbidden  
[0:34:35](https://youtu.be/v4-FUP5Nefk?t=2075) and  
[0:34:36](https://youtu.be/v4-FUP5Nefk?t=2076) it's just to demonstrate  
[0:34:38](https://youtu.be/v4-FUP5Nefk?t=2078) uh  
[0:34:39](https://youtu.be/v4-FUP5Nefk?t=2079) stability but we don't build stability  
[0:34:41](https://youtu.be/v4-FUP5Nefk?t=2081) in a dangerous with a dangerous exercise  
[0:34:43](https://youtu.be/v4-FUP5Nefk?t=2083) we use safe exercises to build that  
[0:34:44](https://youtu.be/v4-FUP5Nefk?t=2084) level of stability but then to  
[0:34:46](https://youtu.be/v4-FUP5Nefk?t=2086) demonstrate stability okay we can do the  
[0:34:48](https://youtu.be/v4-FUP5Nefk?t=2088) forbidden exercise as a demonstration  
[0:34:50](https://youtu.be/v4-FUP5Nefk?t=2090) but stability training is huge number  
[0:34:52](https://youtu.be/v4-FUP5Nefk?t=2092) one is alignment number two is making  
[0:34:54](https://youtu.be/v4-FUP5Nefk?t=2094) sure you don't have tight muscles  
[0:34:56](https://youtu.be/v4-FUP5Nefk?t=2096) because tight muscles pull you out of  
[0:34:57](https://youtu.be/v4-FUP5Nefk?t=2097) alignment and number three is my opinion  
[0:34:59](https://youtu.be/v4-FUP5Nefk?t=2099) is stability that's the one thing i  
[0:35:00](https://youtu.be/v4-FUP5Nefk?t=2100) think that's missing from other programs  
[0:35:02](https://youtu.be/v4-FUP5Nefk?t=2102) i'm a big believer in cultivating far  
[0:35:05](https://youtu.be/v4-FUP5Nefk?t=2105) more stability than you need in your  
[0:35:06](https://youtu.be/v4-FUP5Nefk?t=2106) sport  
[0:35:08](https://youtu.be/v4-FUP5Nefk?t=2108) so the stability needed in mma is far  
[0:35:10](https://youtu.be/v4-FUP5Nefk?t=2110) greater than any other sport i can play  
[0:35:12](https://youtu.be/v4-FUP5Nefk?t=2112) basketball tennis soccer all day long  
[0:35:14](https://youtu.be/v4-FUP5Nefk?t=2114) i'll never hurt myself right because  
[0:35:16](https://youtu.be/v4-FUP5Nefk?t=2116) that's a far less amount of stability i  
[0:35:18](https://youtu.be/v4-FUP5Nefk?t=2118) need  
[0:35:19](https://youtu.be/v4-FUP5Nefk?t=2119) than in wrestling when the guy's  
[0:35:20](https://youtu.be/v4-FUP5Nefk?t=2120) actively trying to throw you on the  
[0:35:21](https://youtu.be/v4-FUP5Nefk?t=2121) ground and the guy's actively trying to  
[0:35:23](https://youtu.be/v4-FUP5Nefk?t=2123) break my leg he's not it's not i broke  
[0:35:24](https://youtu.be/v4-FUP5Nefk?t=2124) my leg kicking a ball no no the guy's  
[0:35:25](https://youtu.be/v4-FUP5Nefk?t=2125) trying to grab my leg and twist my knee  
[0:35:27](https://youtu.be/v4-FUP5Nefk?t=2127) off that's i need a tremendous amount of  
[0:35:29](https://youtu.be/v4-FUP5Nefk?t=2129) know-how and stability and  
[0:35:31](https://youtu.be/v4-FUP5Nefk?t=2131) uh  
[0:35:32](https://youtu.be/v4-FUP5Nefk?t=2132) and athleticism to to keep my knee from  
[0:35:35](https://youtu.be/v4-FUP5Nefk?t=2135) breaking so it's it's a far more  
[0:35:36](https://youtu.be/v4-FUP5Nefk?t=2136) dangerous sport i just had one of my  
[0:35:38](https://youtu.be/v4-FUP5Nefk?t=2138) fighters uh kevin lee he fought in the  
[0:35:40](https://youtu.be/v4-FUP5Nefk?t=2140) khabib's fc  
[0:35:42](https://youtu.be/v4-FUP5Nefk?t=2142) is he with you  
[0:35:45](https://youtu.be/v4-FUP5Nefk?t=2145) and the first kick in the first fight  
[0:35:47](https://youtu.be/v4-FUP5Nefk?t=2147) the first round  
[0:35:49](https://youtu.be/v4-FUP5Nefk?t=2149) broke his acl one kick  
[0:35:51](https://youtu.be/v4-FUP5Nefk?t=2151) he fought the rest of the fight on one  
[0:35:52](https://youtu.be/v4-FUP5Nefk?t=2152) leg basically wobbling he won the fight  
[0:35:55](https://youtu.be/v4-FUP5Nefk?t=2155) did amazing but let's show you how  
[0:35:57](https://youtu.be/v4-FUP5Nefk?t=2157) dangerous the support we have  
[0:35:59](https://youtu.be/v4-FUP5Nefk?t=2159) we're kicking each other in the knees  
[0:36:00](https://youtu.be/v4-FUP5Nefk?t=2160) trying to break each other's legs  
[0:36:02](https://youtu.be/v4-FUP5Nefk?t=2162) so don't tell me after you play tennis  
[0:36:04](https://youtu.be/v4-FUP5Nefk?t=2164) and you hurt your knee that's a very low  
[0:36:06](https://youtu.be/v4-FUP5Nefk?t=2166) level that's a that's  
[0:36:08](https://youtu.be/v4-FUP5Nefk?t=2168) as an mma trainer  
[0:36:09](https://youtu.be/v4-FUP5Nefk?t=2169) i can help you protect your knees as a  
[0:36:12](https://youtu.be/v4-FUP5Nefk?t=2172) tennis player very easily really ah  
[0:36:14](https://youtu.be/v4-FUP5Nefk?t=2174) absolutely because tennis is very it's a  
[0:36:15](https://youtu.be/v4-FUP5Nefk?t=2175) controller you say the same thing about  
[0:36:17](https://youtu.be/v4-FUP5Nefk?t=2177) gymnastics though gymnastics is more  
[0:36:19](https://youtu.be/v4-FUP5Nefk?t=2179) dangerous yeah because gymnasts when  
[0:36:20](https://youtu.be/v4-FUP5Nefk?t=2180) they jump  
[0:36:22](https://youtu.be/v4-FUP5Nefk?t=2182) they've measured the landing force is  
[0:36:23](https://youtu.be/v4-FUP5Nefk?t=2183) sometimes up to 21 times their body  
[0:36:25](https://youtu.be/v4-FUP5Nefk?t=2185) weight yeah  
[0:36:27](https://youtu.be/v4-FUP5Nefk?t=2187) gymnastics can be very dangerous  
[0:36:29](https://youtu.be/v4-FUP5Nefk?t=2189) of course they're very intelligent  
[0:36:30](https://youtu.be/v4-FUP5Nefk?t=2190) trainers i i have a high regard for  
[0:36:32](https://youtu.be/v4-FUP5Nefk?t=2192) gymnastics i i actually use gymnastics a  
[0:36:33](https://youtu.be/v4-FUP5Nefk?t=2193) lot in my program i'm the one who put  
[0:36:36](https://youtu.be/v4-FUP5Nefk?t=2196) georgie appear in gymnastics i'm a big  
[0:36:37](https://youtu.be/v4-FUP5Nefk?t=2197) believer in gymnastics training  
[0:36:39](https://youtu.be/v4-FUP5Nefk?t=2199) they figured it out they figured out the  
[0:36:40](https://youtu.be/v4-FUP5Nefk?t=2200) body how to make it you you decided  
[0:36:42](https://youtu.be/v4-FUP5Nefk?t=2202) because you see the famous you know  
[0:36:44](https://youtu.be/v4-FUP5Nefk?t=2204) videos of him yeah i put him onto  
[0:36:45](https://youtu.be/v4-FUP5Nefk?t=2205) gymnastics really yeah absolutely yeah  
[0:36:47](https://youtu.be/v4-FUP5Nefk?t=2207) definitely  
[0:36:48](https://youtu.be/v4-FUP5Nefk?t=2208) they've understood the body more than  
[0:36:49](https://youtu.be/v4-FUP5Nefk?t=2209) anybody else  
[0:36:51](https://youtu.be/v4-FUP5Nefk?t=2211) when they dismount or they do certain  
[0:36:53](https://youtu.be/v4-FUP5Nefk?t=2213) jumps they've measured one imagine 20  
[0:36:56](https://youtu.be/v4-FUP5Nefk?t=2216) times your body nobody could squat 20  
[0:36:58](https://youtu.be/v4-FUP5Nefk?t=2218) times their body weight doesn't exist  
[0:36:59](https://youtu.be/v4-FUP5Nefk?t=2219) but they go up to  
[0:37:01](https://youtu.be/v4-FUP5Nefk?t=2221) levels of up to 20 times because they're  
[0:37:03](https://youtu.be/v4-FUP5Nefk?t=2223) they're spinning and crashing towards  
[0:37:05](https://youtu.be/v4-FUP5Nefk?t=2225) the ground that's probably the most  
[0:37:05](https://youtu.be/v4-FUP5Nefk?t=2225) dangerous sport  
[0:37:08](https://youtu.be/v4-FUP5Nefk?t=2228) because they do it on mats etc and they  
[0:37:10](https://youtu.be/v4-FUP5Nefk?t=2230) know how to control the the landings  
[0:37:12](https://youtu.be/v4-FUP5Nefk?t=2232) they're brilliant athletes no doubt  
[0:37:14](https://youtu.be/v4-FUP5Nefk?t=2234) um is it the most dangerous sport no i  
[0:37:16](https://youtu.be/v4-FUP5Nefk?t=2236) wouldn't say it's the most dangerous  
[0:37:17](https://youtu.be/v4-FUP5Nefk?t=2237) sport because it's more controlled than  
[0:37:19](https://youtu.be/v4-FUP5Nefk?t=2239) let's say football football in my  
[0:37:20](https://youtu.be/v4-FUP5Nefk?t=2240) opinion is probably the rugby and  
[0:37:22](https://youtu.be/v4-FUP5Nefk?t=2242) football in my opinion is crazy is very  
[0:37:24](https://youtu.be/v4-FUP5Nefk?t=2244) dangerous i gotta i i assume they're all  
[0:37:26](https://youtu.be/v4-FUP5Nefk?t=2246) on on peds because the brutality of that  
[0:37:29](https://youtu.be/v4-FUP5Nefk?t=2249) sport you know every every play  
[0:37:31](https://youtu.be/v4-FUP5Nefk?t=2251) they crash into each other every play  
[0:37:33](https://youtu.be/v4-FUP5Nefk?t=2253) the most recent cte studies that have  
[0:37:36](https://youtu.be/v4-FUP5Nefk?t=2256) been done as usually done in the context  
[0:37:38](https://youtu.be/v4-FUP5Nefk?t=2258) of american football right and this  
[0:37:41](https://youtu.be/v4-FUP5Nefk?t=2261) i've i saw something or heard something  
[0:37:43](https://youtu.be/v4-FUP5Nefk?t=2263) where by  
[0:37:44](https://youtu.be/v4-FUP5Nefk?t=2264) i think i actually might have been joe  
[0:37:45](https://youtu.be/v4-FUP5Nefk?t=2265) rogan he was saying  
[0:37:47](https://youtu.be/v4-FUP5Nefk?t=2267) what he was saying that basically even  
[0:37:48](https://youtu.be/v4-FUP5Nefk?t=2268) if you just do a year of american  
[0:37:50](https://youtu.be/v4-FUP5Nefk?t=2270) football in  
[0:37:52](https://youtu.be/v4-FUP5Nefk?t=2272) in school or college or whatever they  
[0:37:54](https://youtu.be/v4-FUP5Nefk?t=2274) call it in america  
[0:37:55](https://youtu.be/v4-FUP5Nefk?t=2275) because we call college something else  
[0:37:57](https://youtu.be/v4-FUP5Nefk?t=2277) university is  
[0:37:59](https://youtu.be/v4-FUP5Nefk?t=2279) their idea of college i think but um  
[0:38:01](https://youtu.be/v4-FUP5Nefk?t=2281) college whatever if they spend one year  
[0:38:03](https://youtu.be/v4-FUP5Nefk?t=2283) of doing that they can develop cte which  
[0:38:06](https://youtu.be/v4-FUP5Nefk?t=2286) i think is only detectable through  
[0:38:07](https://youtu.be/v4-FUP5Nefk?t=2287) autopsies i'm not sure i'm not sure  
[0:38:09](https://youtu.be/v4-FUP5Nefk?t=2289) actually but they're saying that so  
[0:38:12](https://youtu.be/v4-FUP5Nefk?t=2292) from that angle right i mean because  
[0:38:13](https://youtu.be/v4-FUP5Nefk?t=2293) smashing and all those kind of things  
[0:38:15](https://youtu.be/v4-FUP5Nefk?t=2295) into uh it's a brutal sport it's brutal  
[0:38:17](https://youtu.be/v4-FUP5Nefk?t=2297) there's no weight class you can put your  
[0:38:18](https://youtu.be/v4-FUP5Nefk?t=2298) kids into that yourself no i wouldn't  
[0:38:19](https://youtu.be/v4-FUP5Nefk?t=2299) put my kids in football look you can get  
[0:38:21](https://youtu.be/v4-FUP5Nefk?t=2301) hit by a guy who's 70 pounds heavier  
[0:38:22](https://youtu.be/v4-FUP5Nefk?t=2302) than you it's part of the game you could  
[0:38:24](https://youtu.be/v4-FUP5Nefk?t=2304) be running at you at full speed yeah and  
[0:38:26](https://youtu.be/v4-FUP5Nefk?t=2306) he can hit you without you seeing him  
[0:38:28](https://youtu.be/v4-FUP5Nefk?t=2308) you're you're here breaking a tackle  
[0:38:29](https://youtu.be/v4-FUP5Nefk?t=2309) he's hitting you in this direction it's  
[0:38:30](https://youtu.be/v4-FUP5Nefk?t=2310) a brutal sport i've seen tackles that  
[0:38:32](https://youtu.be/v4-FUP5Nefk?t=2312) were brutal so you would say mma  
[0:38:34](https://youtu.be/v4-FUP5Nefk?t=2314) comparatively is less dangerous  
[0:38:36](https://youtu.be/v4-FUP5Nefk?t=2316) yeah in terms of injuries sustained and  
[0:38:38](https://youtu.be/v4-FUP5Nefk?t=2318) stuff uh i would i would say  
[0:38:40](https://youtu.be/v4-FUP5Nefk?t=2320) it's as dangerous because also don't  
[0:38:42](https://youtu.be/v4-FUP5Nefk?t=2322) forget a knee to the head a kick to the  
[0:38:43](https://youtu.be/v4-FUP5Nefk?t=2323) head a shin to the head is this is  
[0:38:45](https://youtu.be/v4-FUP5Nefk?t=2325) brutal too yeah so i would tell you  
[0:38:47](https://youtu.be/v4-FUP5Nefk?t=2327) football rugby mma i would say they're  
[0:38:48](https://youtu.be/v4-FUP5Nefk?t=2328) on par okay because believe me a flying  
[0:38:51](https://youtu.be/v4-FUP5Nefk?t=2331) knee to the head while you're shooting a  
[0:38:52](https://youtu.be/v4-FUP5Nefk?t=2332) double could be disastrous as well  
[0:38:54](https://youtu.be/v4-FUP5Nefk?t=2334) you could literally break the facial  
[0:38:56](https://youtu.be/v4-FUP5Nefk?t=2336) structure the skull  
[0:38:57](https://youtu.be/v4-FUP5Nefk?t=2337) you know it's unfortunate but i've seen  
[0:38:59](https://youtu.be/v4-FUP5Nefk?t=2339) it but with your own kids then so would  
[0:39:00](https://youtu.be/v4-FUP5Nefk?t=2340) you  
[0:39:01](https://youtu.be/v4-FUP5Nefk?t=2341) what would you want them to be like  
[0:39:03](https://youtu.be/v4-FUP5Nefk?t=2343) would you want them to be  
[0:39:04](https://youtu.be/v4-FUP5Nefk?t=2344) would you would you push them in a  
[0:39:05](https://youtu.be/v4-FUP5Nefk?t=2345) particular direction would you want them  
[0:39:07](https://youtu.be/v4-FUP5Nefk?t=2347) to eat because you've said it before i  
[0:39:08](https://youtu.be/v4-FUP5Nefk?t=2348) think that you'd want them to be black  
[0:39:10](https://youtu.be/v4-FUP5Nefk?t=2350) belts in jiu jitsu yeah at the very  
[0:39:12](https://youtu.be/v4-FUP5Nefk?t=2352) minimum would you want them to stay in  
[0:39:13](https://youtu.be/v4-FUP5Nefk?t=2353) something like grappling to us to avoid  
[0:39:16](https://youtu.be/v4-FUP5Nefk?t=2356) the impact on the head yeah yeah that's  
[0:39:19](https://youtu.be/v4-FUP5Nefk?t=2359) definitely like i want no impact on the  
[0:39:20](https://youtu.be/v4-FUP5Nefk?t=2360) head till they're adult they're finished  
[0:39:21](https://youtu.be/v4-FUP5Nefk?t=2361) developing and then if they're really  
[0:39:23](https://youtu.be/v4-FUP5Nefk?t=2363) passionate about it i want them to learn  
[0:39:25](https://youtu.be/v4-FUP5Nefk?t=2365) kickboxing boxing and jiu jitsu no doubt  
[0:39:27](https://youtu.be/v4-FUP5Nefk?t=2367) yeah because they live with me it's so  
[0:39:28](https://youtu.be/v4-FUP5Nefk?t=2368) easy for them to get the black belt in  
[0:39:30](https://youtu.be/v4-FUP5Nefk?t=2370) in that way they have such an advantage  
[0:39:31](https://youtu.be/v4-FUP5Nefk?t=2371) why not take it like and i feel that jiu  
[0:39:33](https://youtu.be/v4-FUP5Nefk?t=2373) jitsu will prepare them for life you  
[0:39:34](https://youtu.be/v4-FUP5Nefk?t=2374) know teach them to work hard and think  
[0:39:37](https://youtu.be/v4-FUP5Nefk?t=2377) just you have to work hard you have to  
[0:39:38](https://youtu.be/v4-FUP5Nefk?t=2378) be smart you can't be a brutish and you  
[0:39:39](https://youtu.be/v4-FUP5Nefk?t=2379) can't just be smart you have to have  
[0:39:40](https://youtu.be/v4-FUP5Nefk?t=2380) both you're not an intellectual living  
[0:39:43](https://youtu.be/v4-FUP5Nefk?t=2383) behind a book and you're not a guy who's  
[0:39:44](https://youtu.be/v4-FUP5Nefk?t=2384) just lifting weights and getting strong  
[0:39:45](https://youtu.be/v4-FUP5Nefk?t=2385) no no you're you're the two  
[0:39:47](https://youtu.be/v4-FUP5Nefk?t=2387) jiu jitsu is like it's chess it's body  
[0:39:49](https://youtu.be/v4-FUP5Nefk?t=2389) chest so you're developing the body the  
[0:39:51](https://youtu.be/v4-FUP5Nefk?t=2391) mind it's a beautiful thing i really  
[0:39:52](https://youtu.be/v4-FUP5Nefk?t=2392) enjoy that system so i want them to be  
[0:39:54](https://youtu.be/v4-FUP5Nefk?t=2394) black belts and jiu jitsu master the  
[0:39:56](https://youtu.be/v4-FUP5Nefk?t=2396) striking arts and then decide if you  
[0:39:58](https://youtu.be/v4-FUP5Nefk?t=2398) want to fight  
[0:39:59](https://youtu.be/v4-FUP5Nefk?t=2399) it could be a bonus but i would be happy  
[0:40:00](https://youtu.be/v4-FUP5Nefk?t=2400) if my kids were doctors professionals uh  
[0:40:03](https://youtu.be/v4-FUP5Nefk?t=2403) some you know pursue academia would make  
[0:40:05](https://youtu.be/v4-FUP5Nefk?t=2405) me equally happy however i'd want them  
[0:40:07](https://youtu.be/v4-FUP5Nefk?t=2407) to be able to defend themselves for me  
[0:40:08](https://youtu.be/v4-FUP5Nefk?t=2408) it's very important  
[0:40:10](https://youtu.be/v4-FUP5Nefk?t=2410) yeah because this is this is obviously a  
[0:40:12](https://youtu.be/v4-FUP5Nefk?t=2412) tension between like like the mma stuff  
[0:40:15](https://youtu.be/v4-FUP5Nefk?t=2415) and the islamic stuff in particular  
[0:40:17](https://youtu.be/v4-FUP5Nefk?t=2417) because there is a very famous hadith of  
[0:40:19](https://youtu.be/v4-FUP5Nefk?t=2419) the prophet where he says  
[0:40:24](https://youtu.be/v4-FUP5Nefk?t=2424) if you it's very interesting actually if  
[0:40:26](https://youtu.be/v4-FUP5Nefk?t=2426) if if you're fighting with your brother  
[0:40:28](https://youtu.be/v4-FUP5Nefk?t=2428) then you know be careful of the face  
[0:40:31](https://youtu.be/v4-FUP5Nefk?t=2431) because allah has created adam on his  
[0:40:33](https://youtu.be/v4-FUP5Nefk?t=2433) own image  
[0:40:34](https://youtu.be/v4-FUP5Nefk?t=2434) so  
[0:40:35](https://youtu.be/v4-FUP5Nefk?t=2435) the idea being that in training  
[0:40:37](https://youtu.be/v4-FUP5Nefk?t=2437) environments and i think this you are a  
[0:40:38](https://youtu.be/v4-FUP5Nefk?t=2438) pro proponent of a low level don't break  
[0:40:41](https://youtu.be/v4-FUP5Nefk?t=2441) your  
[0:40:42](https://youtu.be/v4-FUP5Nefk?t=2442) your jaw in the gym or don't lose your  
[0:40:44](https://youtu.be/v4-FUP5Nefk?t=2444) your jaw in the gym or your chin in the  
[0:40:46](https://youtu.be/v4-FUP5Nefk?t=2446) gym  
[0:40:47](https://youtu.be/v4-FUP5Nefk?t=2447) um  
[0:40:48](https://youtu.be/v4-FUP5Nefk?t=2448) kind of thing where you're smashing your  
[0:40:49](https://youtu.be/v4-FUP5Nefk?t=2449) head all the time  
[0:40:51](https://youtu.be/v4-FUP5Nefk?t=2451) now science is telling us cte and all  
[0:40:53](https://youtu.be/v4-FUP5Nefk?t=2453) that kind of thing as well  
[0:40:54](https://youtu.be/v4-FUP5Nefk?t=2454) um it because the thing is if you have  
[0:40:56](https://youtu.be/v4-FUP5Nefk?t=2456) an intellectual pursuit  
[0:40:58](https://youtu.be/v4-FUP5Nefk?t=2458) which i think  
[0:40:59](https://youtu.be/v4-FUP5Nefk?t=2459) like for example in the community we  
[0:41:01](https://youtu.be/v4-FUP5Nefk?t=2461) would want our people to have  
[0:41:02](https://youtu.be/v4-FUP5Nefk?t=2462) intellectual pursuits but you also have  
[0:41:04](https://youtu.be/v4-FUP5Nefk?t=2464) a physical pursuit you wouldn't want  
[0:41:06](https://youtu.be/v4-FUP5Nefk?t=2466) those two things to kind of work  
[0:41:08](https://youtu.be/v4-FUP5Nefk?t=2468) against one against one another and so a  
[0:41:11](https://youtu.be/v4-FUP5Nefk?t=2471) heavy like so for me i mean i i've told  
[0:41:14](https://youtu.be/v4-FUP5Nefk?t=2474) you already like i've got my kids in bjj  
[0:41:17](https://youtu.be/v4-FUP5Nefk?t=2477) and i'm like focusing on grappling with  
[0:41:19](https://youtu.be/v4-FUP5Nefk?t=2479) them but i do realize i see the very  
[0:41:22](https://youtu.be/v4-FUP5Nefk?t=2482) important  
[0:41:24](https://youtu.be/v4-FUP5Nefk?t=2484) uh need for striking and i understand  
[0:41:26](https://youtu.be/v4-FUP5Nefk?t=2486) also to get to develop that martial  
[0:41:28](https://youtu.be/v4-FUP5Nefk?t=2488) literacy you need to do some sparring  
[0:41:30](https://youtu.be/v4-FUP5Nefk?t=2490) but if you do inspiring with someone who  
[0:41:32](https://youtu.be/v4-FUP5Nefk?t=2492) wants to take your head off every time  
[0:41:34](https://youtu.be/v4-FUP5Nefk?t=2494) then there's an issue here as well isn't  
[0:41:36](https://youtu.be/v4-FUP5Nefk?t=2496) that they can you know ev every gym has  
[0:41:38](https://youtu.be/v4-FUP5Nefk?t=2498) this culture what's the culture of  
[0:41:39](https://youtu.be/v4-FUP5Nefk?t=2499) tristar then culture is controlled  
[0:41:41](https://youtu.be/v4-FUP5Nefk?t=2501) because we have classes called touch  
[0:41:42](https://youtu.be/v4-FUP5Nefk?t=2502) sparring classes where there's no hard  
[0:41:44](https://youtu.be/v4-FUP5Nefk?t=2504) hard shots just play spark and then  
[0:41:46](https://youtu.be/v4-FUP5Nefk?t=2506) after you develop a certain ability to  
[0:41:48](https://youtu.be/v4-FUP5Nefk?t=2508) move  
[0:41:49](https://youtu.be/v4-FUP5Nefk?t=2509) then we invite you to the more robust  
[0:41:51](https://youtu.be/v4-FUP5Nefk?t=2511) sparrings yes and those robust sparrings  
[0:41:53](https://youtu.be/v4-FUP5Nefk?t=2513) are limited two times a week and for  
[0:41:55](https://youtu.be/v4-FUP5Nefk?t=2515) training camp and they're done they're  
[0:41:57](https://youtu.be/v4-FUP5Nefk?t=2517) done more sparingly  
[0:41:59](https://youtu.be/v4-FUP5Nefk?t=2519) and even then there's a control even  
[0:42:01](https://youtu.be/v4-FUP5Nefk?t=2521) then so so you would then you wouldn't  
[0:42:03](https://youtu.be/v4-FUP5Nefk?t=2523) allow like elbows and knees no  
[0:42:05](https://youtu.be/v4-FUP5Nefk?t=2525) only only the guys i trust the most were  
[0:42:07](https://youtu.be/v4-FUP5Nefk?t=2527) gonna like simulate it they're not gonna  
[0:42:09](https://youtu.be/v4-FUP5Nefk?t=2529) throw it for real okay the reason why  
[0:42:10](https://youtu.be/v4-FUP5Nefk?t=2530) you wanna build the body yes yes you  
[0:42:12](https://youtu.be/v4-FUP5Nefk?t=2532) don't wanna destroy the body when you go  
[0:42:14](https://youtu.be/v4-FUP5Nefk?t=2534) in the gym you have to build the body  
[0:42:15](https://youtu.be/v4-FUP5Nefk?t=2535) not destroy the body people go in the  
[0:42:16](https://youtu.be/v4-FUP5Nefk?t=2536) gym to destroy the body it's wrong it's  
[0:42:18](https://youtu.be/v4-FUP5Nefk?t=2538) the wrong way of thinking now there are  
[0:42:19](https://youtu.be/v4-FUP5Nefk?t=2539) two methods to  
[0:42:20](https://youtu.be/v4-FUP5Nefk?t=2540) build a very  
[0:42:22](https://youtu.be/v4-FUP5Nefk?t=2542) strong gym one you put everybody all  
[0:42:24](https://youtu.be/v4-FUP5Nefk?t=2544) these alpha males in one room you're in  
[0:42:25](https://youtu.be/v4-FUP5Nefk?t=2545) a metropolitan city where there's  
[0:42:26](https://youtu.be/v4-FUP5Nefk?t=2546) millions and millions of people  
[0:42:28](https://youtu.be/v4-FUP5Nefk?t=2548) you're flooded with guys who want to  
[0:42:29](https://youtu.be/v4-FUP5Nefk?t=2549) make it you put them in the room they  
[0:42:30](https://youtu.be/v4-FUP5Nefk?t=2550) kill each other there's one guy who  
[0:42:32](https://youtu.be/v4-FUP5Nefk?t=2552) survives at all and he's your champion  
[0:42:34](https://youtu.be/v4-FUP5Nefk?t=2554) then you have a thousand one dead bodies  
[0:42:36](https://youtu.be/v4-FUP5Nefk?t=2556) but you have one champion yeah  
[0:42:38](https://youtu.be/v4-FUP5Nefk?t=2558) and the other method is  
[0:42:39](https://youtu.be/v4-FUP5Nefk?t=2559) you teach each one of them how to be  
[0:42:41](https://youtu.be/v4-FUP5Nefk?t=2561) their best you exhaust their potential  
[0:42:43](https://youtu.be/v4-FUP5Nefk?t=2563) there's a you create a synergy where  
[0:42:44](https://youtu.be/v4-FUP5Nefk?t=2564) everybody respects everyone nobody  
[0:42:46](https://youtu.be/v4-FUP5Nefk?t=2566) injures the other we're here to develop  
[0:42:48](https://youtu.be/v4-FUP5Nefk?t=2568) our skills not kill each other and then  
[0:42:49](https://youtu.be/v4-FUP5Nefk?t=2569) you have a variety of of excellent  
[0:42:52](https://youtu.be/v4-FUP5Nefk?t=2572) fighters yeah  
[0:42:54](https://youtu.be/v4-FUP5Nefk?t=2574) and then from there they feed off each  
[0:42:55](https://youtu.be/v4-FUP5Nefk?t=2575) other because excellence breeds  
[0:42:57](https://youtu.be/v4-FUP5Nefk?t=2577) excellence and so on you have you got  
[0:42:58](https://youtu.be/v4-FUP5Nefk?t=2578) this type of synergy  
[0:43:00](https://youtu.be/v4-FUP5Nefk?t=2580) but many gyms are the darwinian style as  
[0:43:02](https://youtu.be/v4-FUP5Nefk?t=2582) if i could say you know it's killer be  
[0:43:04](https://youtu.be/v4-FUP5Nefk?t=2584) killed and you didn't make it too bad  
[0:43:05](https://youtu.be/v4-FUP5Nefk?t=2585) there's another guy waiting to take your  
[0:43:06](https://youtu.be/v4-FUP5Nefk?t=2586) place because we're in a very we're  
[0:43:07](https://youtu.be/v4-FUP5Nefk?t=2587) we're in a city where it's too  
[0:43:08](https://youtu.be/v4-FUP5Nefk?t=2588) jam-packed we have too many people  
[0:43:10](https://youtu.be/v4-FUP5Nefk?t=2590) and you got hurt there's less space on  
[0:43:12](https://youtu.be/v4-FUP5Nefk?t=2592) there's more space on the mat for us  
[0:43:14](https://youtu.be/v4-FUP5Nefk?t=2594) because there are some places where  
[0:43:15](https://youtu.be/v4-FUP5Nefk?t=2595) they're so full of people  
[0:43:18](https://youtu.be/v4-FUP5Nefk?t=2598) that they don't care if they lose a  
[0:43:19](https://youtu.be/v4-FUP5Nefk?t=2599) customer or not or a fighter they have  
[0:43:20](https://youtu.be/v4-FUP5Nefk?t=2600) another guy coming in town he wants to  
[0:43:22](https://youtu.be/v4-FUP5Nefk?t=2602) make it too so it all depends on what  
[0:43:24](https://youtu.be/v4-FUP5Nefk?t=2604) kind of atmosphere and i breed an  
[0:43:26](https://youtu.be/v4-FUP5Nefk?t=2606) atmosphere of building right not  
[0:43:29](https://youtu.be/v4-FUP5Nefk?t=2609) uh last man standing type uh atmosphere  
[0:43:31](https://youtu.be/v4-FUP5Nefk?t=2611) and is that i've heard i'm not sure of  
[0:43:33](https://youtu.be/v4-FUP5Nefk?t=2613) talks industry but for example in  
[0:43:35](https://youtu.be/v4-FUP5Nefk?t=2615) dagestan the way they do wrestling and  
[0:43:37](https://youtu.be/v4-FUP5Nefk?t=2617) stuff like that they're soft they play  
[0:43:40](https://youtu.be/v4-FUP5Nefk?t=2620) they're more playful yeah  
[0:43:41](https://youtu.be/v4-FUP5Nefk?t=2621) and do you think that's that might be a  
[0:43:43](https://youtu.be/v4-FUP5Nefk?t=2623) secret to their success because we're  
[0:43:44](https://youtu.be/v4-FUP5Nefk?t=2624) seeing the rise of  
[0:43:46](https://youtu.be/v4-FUP5Nefk?t=2626) i mean you've got um sagilev who's the  
[0:43:48](https://youtu.be/v4-FUP5Nefk?t=2628) wrestler like he's he's i'm not sure  
[0:43:50](https://youtu.be/v4-FUP5Nefk?t=2630) seen as pound-for-pound best freestyle  
[0:43:52](https://youtu.be/v4-FUP5Nefk?t=2632) wrestler in the world right now and then  
[0:43:54](https://youtu.be/v4-FUP5Nefk?t=2634) you've got like all these kind of  
[0:43:55](https://youtu.be/v4-FUP5Nefk?t=2635) fighters of khabib being notable but  
[0:43:58](https://youtu.be/v4-FUP5Nefk?t=2638) ankylo have done really well really well  
[0:44:00](https://youtu.be/v4-FUP5Nefk?t=2640) now in the light heavyweight division  
[0:44:02](https://youtu.be/v4-FUP5Nefk?t=2642) and other fighters as well  
[0:44:04](https://youtu.be/v4-FUP5Nefk?t=2644) they seem to have a real  
[0:44:06](https://youtu.be/v4-FUP5Nefk?t=2646) kind of pedigree  
[0:44:08](https://youtu.be/v4-FUP5Nefk?t=2648) and  
[0:44:09](https://youtu.be/v4-FUP5Nefk?t=2649) at the heart of it is grappling so is is  
[0:44:12](https://youtu.be/v4-FUP5Nefk?t=2652) is that because they've developed team  
[0:44:14](https://youtu.be/v4-FUP5Nefk?t=2654) spirit that they're all working with  
[0:44:16](https://youtu.be/v4-FUP5Nefk?t=2656) each other or is it because of the  
[0:44:17](https://youtu.be/v4-FUP5Nefk?t=2657) playful kind of training what is it  
[0:44:19](https://youtu.be/v4-FUP5Nefk?t=2659) really what i think is i think i think  
[0:44:21](https://youtu.be/v4-FUP5Nefk?t=2661) they have a  
[0:44:22](https://youtu.be/v4-FUP5Nefk?t=2662) they have a  
[0:44:24](https://youtu.be/v4-FUP5Nefk?t=2664) learn the sequences they have they have  
[0:44:25](https://youtu.be/v4-FUP5Nefk?t=2665) a higher regard for technique  
[0:44:28](https://youtu.be/v4-FUP5Nefk?t=2668) and so if you do something and you do it  
[0:44:30](https://youtu.be/v4-FUP5Nefk?t=2670) using force it's considered your  
[0:44:32](https://youtu.be/v4-FUP5Nefk?t=2672) wrestling is ugly it's not aesthetically  
[0:44:34](https://youtu.be/v4-FUP5Nefk?t=2674) pleasing  
[0:44:35](https://youtu.be/v4-FUP5Nefk?t=2675) why because if you mastered the  
[0:44:36](https://youtu.be/v4-FUP5Nefk?t=2676) technique and then you unleash your  
[0:44:37](https://youtu.be/v4-FUP5Nefk?t=2677) force you'd be even better  
[0:44:39](https://youtu.be/v4-FUP5Nefk?t=2679) so they they breed a culture of wow you  
[0:44:42](https://youtu.be/v4-FUP5Nefk?t=2682) got the technique right  
[0:44:44](https://youtu.be/v4-FUP5Nefk?t=2684) where in america if you do something  
[0:44:46](https://youtu.be/v4-FUP5Nefk?t=2686) athletic it's wow look how you bypass  
[0:44:48](https://youtu.be/v4-FUP5Nefk?t=2688) the system yeah yeah whereas them know  
[0:44:51](https://youtu.be/v4-FUP5Nefk?t=2691) do it right there's a wrong way in the  
[0:44:53](https://youtu.be/v4-FUP5Nefk?t=2693) right way and then demonstrate your  
[0:44:54](https://youtu.be/v4-FUP5Nefk?t=2694) athleticism so it's it's really the the  
[0:44:57](https://youtu.be/v4-FUP5Nefk?t=2697) tradition of teaching and training  
[0:44:58](https://youtu.be/v4-FUP5Nefk?t=2698) because not that americans are not  
[0:45:01](https://youtu.be/v4-FUP5Nefk?t=2701) technical they are definitely they just  
[0:45:03](https://youtu.be/v4-FUP5Nefk?t=2703) also have a great  
[0:45:05](https://youtu.be/v4-FUP5Nefk?t=2705) enjoyment to watch something athletic  
[0:45:07](https://youtu.be/v4-FUP5Nefk?t=2707) just something that's  
[0:45:08](https://youtu.be/v4-FUP5Nefk?t=2708) freaky you know the guy can jump so much  
[0:45:10](https://youtu.be/v4-FUP5Nefk?t=2710) or he can pull so much or what  
[0:45:12](https://youtu.be/v4-FUP5Nefk?t=2712) they have more they breathe more culture  
[0:45:14](https://youtu.be/v4-FUP5Nefk?t=2714) of do you do it right do you understand  
[0:45:16](https://youtu.be/v4-FUP5Nefk?t=2716) why we do it this way and if the answer  
[0:45:18](https://youtu.be/v4-FUP5Nefk?t=2718) is yes it's good if the answer is bad  
[0:45:20](https://youtu.be/v4-FUP5Nefk?t=2720) explain it to him again you know because  
[0:45:22](https://youtu.be/v4-FUP5Nefk?t=2722) they have this and that's why look the  
[0:45:23](https://youtu.be/v4-FUP5Nefk?t=2723) european wrestling there's a lot to say  
[0:45:25](https://youtu.be/v4-FUP5Nefk?t=2725) they have a lot more gold medals than in  
[0:45:27](https://youtu.be/v4-FUP5Nefk?t=2727) the west okay  
[0:45:28](https://youtu.be/v4-FUP5Nefk?t=2728) and also they support their athletes  
[0:45:30](https://youtu.be/v4-FUP5Nefk?t=2730) more their other their other factors but  
[0:45:31](https://youtu.be/v4-FUP5Nefk?t=2731) generally speaking most  
[0:45:33](https://youtu.be/v4-FUP5Nefk?t=2733) wrestling experts will tell you that  
[0:45:34](https://youtu.be/v4-FUP5Nefk?t=2734) they're more technical  
[0:45:36](https://youtu.be/v4-FUP5Nefk?t=2736) the wrestling is more it's superior  
[0:45:40](https://youtu.be/v4-FUP5Nefk?t=2740) does that have to do with state funding  
[0:45:42](https://youtu.be/v4-FUP5Nefk?t=2742) i would say yes but also the culture of  
[0:45:43](https://youtu.be/v4-FUP5Nefk?t=2743) learning like for instance if you look  
[0:45:44](https://youtu.be/v4-FUP5Nefk?t=2744) at scandinavian countries they they do  
[0:45:46](https://youtu.be/v4-FUP5Nefk?t=2746) really well in school even though they  
[0:45:48](https://youtu.be/v4-FUP5Nefk?t=2748) do less hours and less homework and they  
[0:45:49](https://youtu.be/v4-FUP5Nefk?t=2749) start at a later age why is that  
[0:45:51](https://youtu.be/v4-FUP5Nefk?t=2751) well in america if you say something  
[0:45:53](https://youtu.be/v4-FUP5Nefk?t=2753) like not not everywhere in america but  
[0:45:55](https://youtu.be/v4-FUP5Nefk?t=2755) like  
[0:45:57](https://youtu.be/v4-FUP5Nefk?t=2757) let's just put it this way they have a  
[0:45:58](https://youtu.be/v4-FUP5Nefk?t=2758) high regard for  
[0:46:01](https://youtu.be/v4-FUP5Nefk?t=2761) um  
[0:46:02](https://youtu.be/v4-FUP5Nefk?t=2762) education education is seen as a good  
[0:46:04](https://youtu.be/v4-FUP5Nefk?t=2764) thing it's seen it is true in america  
[0:46:06](https://youtu.be/v4-FUP5Nefk?t=2766) but maybe more so in scandinavian  
[0:46:08](https://youtu.be/v4-FUP5Nefk?t=2768) countries saying something like for  
[0:46:10](https://youtu.be/v4-FUP5Nefk?t=2770) instance i remember watching dr phil  
[0:46:13](https://youtu.be/v4-FUP5Nefk?t=2773) and there was this girl she was 16 years  
[0:46:14](https://youtu.be/v4-FUP5Nefk?t=2774) old and she was like  
[0:46:15](https://youtu.be/v4-FUP5Nefk?t=2775) getting angry at the crowd and she's  
[0:46:17](https://youtu.be/v4-FUP5Nefk?t=2777) like take catch me outside how about  
[0:46:18](https://youtu.be/v4-FUP5Nefk?t=2778) that  
[0:46:20](https://youtu.be/v4-FUP5Nefk?t=2780) catch me outside let's go fight outside  
[0:46:21](https://youtu.be/v4-FUP5Nefk?t=2781) she's saying and when she said that i  
[0:46:23](https://youtu.be/v4-FUP5Nefk?t=2783) didn't understand what you're saying but  
[0:46:23](https://youtu.be/v4-FUP5Nefk?t=2783) she became a star  
[0:46:25](https://youtu.be/v4-FUP5Nefk?t=2785) now in scandinavia she would be it would  
[0:46:27](https://youtu.be/v4-FUP5Nefk?t=2787) be frowned upon because she's doing  
[0:46:28](https://youtu.be/v4-FUP5Nefk?t=2788) something a behavior that's probably  
[0:46:30](https://youtu.be/v4-FUP5Nefk?t=2790) ignorant you know it seems like but in  
[0:46:31](https://youtu.be/v4-FUP5Nefk?t=2791) america they'll they'll marvel at  
[0:46:33](https://youtu.be/v4-FUP5Nefk?t=2793) they'll laugh about it because it's cool  
[0:46:35](https://youtu.be/v4-FUP5Nefk?t=2795) it's funny and she later became a  
[0:46:37](https://youtu.be/v4-FUP5Nefk?t=2797) millionaire she signed a 16 million  
[0:46:38](https://youtu.be/v4-FUP5Nefk?t=2798) dollar contract or 40 if millions of  
[0:46:40](https://youtu.be/v4-FUP5Nefk?t=2800) dollars to do like a music video where  
[0:46:42](https://youtu.be/v4-FUP5Nefk?t=2802) she's just lip singing and it's like  
[0:46:44](https://youtu.be/v4-FUP5Nefk?t=2804) crazy that they made her such a star why  
[0:46:46](https://youtu.be/v4-FUP5Nefk?t=2806) because she went on dr phil and she  
[0:46:48](https://youtu.be/v4-FUP5Nefk?t=2808) behaved in a certain way  
[0:46:49](https://youtu.be/v4-FUP5Nefk?t=2809) now in certain other cultures that would  
[0:46:51](https://youtu.be/v4-FUP5Nefk?t=2811) be rejected  
[0:46:52](https://youtu.be/v4-FUP5Nefk?t=2812) that would be frowned upon that would be  
[0:46:53](https://youtu.be/v4-FUP5Nefk?t=2813) embarrassing they probably wouldn't even  
[0:46:55](https://youtu.be/v4-FUP5Nefk?t=2815) show it on the air  
[0:46:56](https://youtu.be/v4-FUP5Nefk?t=2816) however in certain cultures hey it's  
[0:46:58](https://youtu.be/v4-FUP5Nefk?t=2818) considered cool and fun and and funny  
[0:47:00](https://youtu.be/v4-FUP5Nefk?t=2820) and then marvelous and whatnot so  
[0:47:03](https://youtu.be/v4-FUP5Nefk?t=2823) culture makes a huge difference  
[0:47:05](https://youtu.be/v4-FUP5Nefk?t=2825) absolutely right like you know  
[0:47:06](https://youtu.be/v4-FUP5Nefk?t=2826) especially in india china like  
[0:47:08](https://youtu.be/v4-FUP5Nefk?t=2828) why why do they  
[0:47:10](https://youtu.be/v4-FUP5Nefk?t=2830) excel so much over and above western  
[0:47:12](https://youtu.be/v4-FUP5Nefk?t=2832) countries and for example sub jobs like  
[0:47:14](https://youtu.be/v4-FUP5Nefk?t=2834) mathematics  
[0:47:16](https://youtu.be/v4-FUP5Nefk?t=2836) uh probably the same kind of reasoning  
[0:47:18](https://youtu.be/v4-FUP5Nefk?t=2838) the the education and the teacher gets  
[0:47:20](https://youtu.be/v4-FUP5Nefk?t=2840) to maintain his integrity whereas in the  
[0:47:22](https://youtu.be/v4-FUP5Nefk?t=2842) west the teacher is almost like a  
[0:47:24](https://youtu.be/v4-FUP5Nefk?t=2844) dispensable asset like you know you can  
[0:47:26](https://youtu.be/v4-FUP5Nefk?t=2846) just replace him if you don't like him  
[0:47:27](https://youtu.be/v4-FUP5Nefk?t=2847) you can vote him out or something you  
[0:47:28](https://youtu.be/v4-FUP5Nefk?t=2848) know i remember watching a documentary  
[0:47:30](https://youtu.be/v4-FUP5Nefk?t=2850) where they they sent they brought in a  
[0:47:32](https://youtu.be/v4-FUP5Nefk?t=2852) chinese  
[0:47:33](https://youtu.be/v4-FUP5Nefk?t=2853) a group of chinese teachers here to  
[0:47:34](https://youtu.be/v4-FUP5Nefk?t=2854) england  
[0:47:36](https://youtu.be/v4-FUP5Nefk?t=2856) and they separated a grade one would do  
[0:47:37](https://youtu.be/v4-FUP5Nefk?t=2857) the chinese system one would do  
[0:47:39](https://youtu.be/v4-FUP5Nefk?t=2859) the english system  
[0:47:41](https://youtu.be/v4-FUP5Nefk?t=2861) and the chinese teachers were like  
[0:47:45](https://youtu.be/v4-FUP5Nefk?t=2865) in china we don't have to discipline  
[0:47:46](https://youtu.be/v4-FUP5Nefk?t=2866) because they were asking the students to  
[0:47:48](https://youtu.be/v4-FUP5Nefk?t=2868) do a b and c and the students weren't  
[0:47:50](https://youtu.be/v4-FUP5Nefk?t=2870) doing it  
[0:47:51](https://youtu.be/v4-FUP5Nefk?t=2871) and that the chinese teachers were  
[0:47:52](https://youtu.be/v4-FUP5Nefk?t=2872) perplexed they were like in china we  
[0:47:54](https://youtu.be/v4-FUP5Nefk?t=2874) don't have to discipline they're born  
[0:47:55](https://youtu.be/v4-FUP5Nefk?t=2875) disciplined  
[0:47:56](https://youtu.be/v4-FUP5Nefk?t=2876) meaning in their culture they're raised  
[0:47:58](https://youtu.be/v4-FUP5Nefk?t=2878) by the time they go to school they  
[0:47:59](https://youtu.be/v4-FUP5Nefk?t=2879) already understand that you have to  
[0:48:00](https://youtu.be/v4-FUP5Nefk?t=2880) follow the rules and it's natural to  
[0:48:02](https://youtu.be/v4-FUP5Nefk?t=2882) them  
[0:48:02](https://youtu.be/v4-FUP5Nefk?t=2882) so in the west they had this different  
[0:48:04](https://youtu.be/v4-FUP5Nefk?t=2884) challenge where they had to they had to  
[0:48:07](https://youtu.be/v4-FUP5Nefk?t=2887) try to discipline the children but they  
[0:48:08](https://youtu.be/v4-FUP5Nefk?t=2888) had no means to they had no program for  
[0:48:10](https://youtu.be/v4-FUP5Nefk?t=2890) this and they were making the kids work  
[0:48:12](https://youtu.be/v4-FUP5Nefk?t=2892) harder longer and eventually they  
[0:48:14](https://youtu.be/v4-FUP5Nefk?t=2894) compared the grades and the chinese  
[0:48:16](https://youtu.be/v4-FUP5Nefk?t=2896) school had better grades the chinese  
[0:48:18](https://youtu.be/v4-FUP5Nefk?t=2898) group but then the chinese teacher said  
[0:48:21](https://youtu.be/v4-FUP5Nefk?t=2901) something very interesting he said look  
[0:48:23](https://youtu.be/v4-FUP5Nefk?t=2903) in china we have kung fu  
[0:48:26](https://youtu.be/v4-FUP5Nefk?t=2906) and we have pandas but we would never  
[0:48:28](https://youtu.be/v4-FUP5Nefk?t=2908) have kung fu panda meaning  
[0:48:30](https://youtu.be/v4-FUP5Nefk?t=2910) that by being so rigid they kind of kill  
[0:48:33](https://youtu.be/v4-FUP5Nefk?t=2913) creativity and that's something the west  
[0:48:35](https://youtu.be/v4-FUP5Nefk?t=2915) has that so this it was complimentary  
[0:48:37](https://youtu.be/v4-FUP5Nefk?t=2917) yeah yeah hard work will make you book  
[0:48:39](https://youtu.be/v4-FUP5Nefk?t=2919) smart yes but what is it taking from you  
[0:48:41](https://youtu.be/v4-FUP5Nefk?t=2921) you know mark twain said the best one  
[0:48:42](https://youtu.be/v4-FUP5Nefk?t=2922) time he said don't let don't let school  
[0:48:45](https://youtu.be/v4-FUP5Nefk?t=2925) get in the way of your education wow  
[0:48:49](https://youtu.be/v4-FUP5Nefk?t=2929) so look being i should have said that to  
[0:48:51](https://youtu.be/v4-FUP5Nefk?t=2931) the teacher when i was being  
[0:48:52](https://youtu.be/v4-FUP5Nefk?t=2932) sent to the detention center all the  
[0:48:54](https://youtu.be/v4-FUP5Nefk?t=2934) time  
[0:48:55](https://youtu.be/v4-FUP5Nefk?t=2935) i think i think you can go too far in  
[0:48:58](https://youtu.be/v4-FUP5Nefk?t=2938) being rigid and academic  
[0:49:00](https://youtu.be/v4-FUP5Nefk?t=2940) because it can cost i think both sides  
[0:49:02](https://youtu.be/v4-FUP5Nefk?t=2942) have something to learn from one another  
[0:49:03](https://youtu.be/v4-FUP5Nefk?t=2943) yeah yeah sure it's complementary that  
[0:49:05](https://youtu.be/v4-FUP5Nefk?t=2945) we have to strike a middle ground  
[0:49:06](https://youtu.be/v4-FUP5Nefk?t=2946) somewhere but comparing the two makes  
[0:49:08](https://youtu.be/v4-FUP5Nefk?t=2948) for interesting uh uh con like um  
[0:49:12](https://youtu.be/v4-FUP5Nefk?t=2952) you know  
[0:49:13](https://youtu.be/v4-FUP5Nefk?t=2953) it'll teach us to think differently and  
[0:49:15](https://youtu.be/v4-FUP5Nefk?t=2955) experiment with different methods but i  
[0:49:17](https://youtu.be/v4-FUP5Nefk?t=2957) think culture is something that's  
[0:49:18](https://youtu.be/v4-FUP5Nefk?t=2958) overlooked it makes a massive difference  
[0:49:20](https://youtu.be/v4-FUP5Nefk?t=2960) like me my kids i try to instill instill  
[0:49:22](https://youtu.be/v4-FUP5Nefk?t=2962) into them that on knowledge knowledge  
[0:49:27](https://youtu.be/v4-FUP5Nefk?t=2967) knowledge is good for you always truth  
[0:49:28](https://youtu.be/v4-FUP5Nefk?t=2968) is always good for you one way or  
[0:49:30](https://youtu.be/v4-FUP5Nefk?t=2970) another truth is good for your truth is  
[0:49:31](https://youtu.be/v4-FUP5Nefk?t=2971) something to be desired and one way or  
[0:49:33](https://youtu.be/v4-FUP5Nefk?t=2973) another it  
[0:49:34](https://youtu.be/v4-FUP5Nefk?t=2974) it brings you a benefit one way or  
[0:49:36](https://youtu.be/v4-FUP5Nefk?t=2976) another you have to have that kind of uh  
[0:49:39](https://youtu.be/v4-FUP5Nefk?t=2979) belief in truth you know one way or  
[0:49:41](https://youtu.be/v4-FUP5Nefk?t=2981) another the truth is always good for me  
[0:49:43](https://youtu.be/v4-FUP5Nefk?t=2983) even though i think it's bad now down  
[0:49:44](https://youtu.be/v4-FUP5Nefk?t=2984) the line is gonna it's gonna provide  
[0:49:46](https://youtu.be/v4-FUP5Nefk?t=2986) something  
[0:49:47](https://youtu.be/v4-FUP5Nefk?t=2987) truth is that truth is a very special  
[0:49:50](https://youtu.be/v4-FUP5Nefk?t=2990) phenomenon  
[0:49:51](https://youtu.be/v4-FUP5Nefk?t=2991) do you know um one of what i have these  
[0:49:53](https://youtu.be/v4-FUP5Nefk?t=2993) conversations with you especially when  
[0:49:54](https://youtu.be/v4-FUP5Nefk?t=2994) you have private conversations one thing  
[0:49:55](https://youtu.be/v4-FUP5Nefk?t=2995) that always comes up is family and uh  
[0:49:58](https://youtu.be/v4-FUP5Nefk?t=2998) even those who kind of follow you on  
[0:50:00](https://youtu.be/v4-FUP5Nefk?t=3000) social media would have seen the video  
[0:50:02](https://youtu.be/v4-FUP5Nefk?t=3002) that you very famous viral video that  
[0:50:03](https://youtu.be/v4-FUP5Nefk?t=3003) you've done was like a day in the life  
[0:50:05](https://youtu.be/v4-FUP5Nefk?t=3005) of for us the hobby very beautiful video  
[0:50:07](https://youtu.be/v4-FUP5Nefk?t=3007) fantastic and one thing that really  
[0:50:09](https://youtu.be/v4-FUP5Nefk?t=3009) sticks out or  
[0:50:10](https://youtu.be/v4-FUP5Nefk?t=3010) is your relationship with your children  
[0:50:13](https://youtu.be/v4-FUP5Nefk?t=3013) like you do  
[0:50:14](https://youtu.be/v4-FUP5Nefk?t=3014) uh as many people that would watch your  
[0:50:16](https://youtu.be/v4-FUP5Nefk?t=3016) content would know you do like jiu-jitsu  
[0:50:18](https://youtu.be/v4-FUP5Nefk?t=3018) with them you do martial arts with them  
[0:50:20](https://youtu.be/v4-FUP5Nefk?t=3020) but you do a lot of  
[0:50:22](https://youtu.be/v4-FUP5Nefk?t=3022) conversation with them and this is  
[0:50:23](https://youtu.be/v4-FUP5Nefk?t=3023) something that i think which is being  
[0:50:24](https://youtu.be/v4-FUP5Nefk?t=3024) lost in transition in our communities  
[0:50:26](https://youtu.be/v4-FUP5Nefk?t=3026) like where fathers are actually taking  
[0:50:29](https://youtu.be/v4-FUP5Nefk?t=3029) you know a responsible role with their  
[0:50:30](https://youtu.be/v4-FUP5Nefk?t=3030) children  
[0:50:32](https://youtu.be/v4-FUP5Nefk?t=3032) what do you have to say about  
[0:50:34](https://youtu.be/v4-FUP5Nefk?t=3034) the extent to which we should as men for  
[0:50:37](https://youtu.be/v4-FUP5Nefk?t=3037) example be responsible over our children  
[0:50:39](https://youtu.be/v4-FUP5Nefk?t=3039) and what kind of fruit does this have in  
[0:50:41](https://youtu.be/v4-FUP5Nefk?t=3041) one's life  
[0:50:43](https://youtu.be/v4-FUP5Nefk?t=3043) look i would say after after god what's  
[0:50:45](https://youtu.be/v4-FUP5Nefk?t=3045) the next important thing in your life  
[0:50:47](https://youtu.be/v4-FUP5Nefk?t=3047) it should be family it's the greatest

[0:53:54](https://youtu.be/v4-FUP5Nefk?t=3234) but there's a there's a fear in that  
[0:53:56](https://youtu.be/v4-FUP5Nefk?t=3236) because my my youngest daughter as well  
[0:53:58](https://youtu.be/v4-FUP5Nefk?t=3238) to be honest with you  
[0:54:00](https://youtu.be/v4-FUP5Nefk?t=3240) i'm actually in a similar camp i worry  
[0:54:02](https://youtu.be/v4-FUP5Nefk?t=3242) that you know she's going to be spoiled  
[0:54:05](https://youtu.be/v4-FUP5Nefk?t=3245) let's put it mildly you know because you  
[0:54:07](https://youtu.be/v4-FUP5Nefk?t=3247) know she's she can always like get her  
[0:54:09](https://youtu.be/v4-FUP5Nefk?t=3249) way through  
[0:54:11](https://youtu.be/v4-FUP5Nefk?t=3251) kind of cry of course smile make her  
[0:54:13](https://youtu.be/v4-FUP5Nefk?t=3253) face or something she knows how to play  
[0:54:14](https://youtu.be/v4-FUP5Nefk?t=3254) the system  
[0:54:16](https://youtu.be/v4-FUP5Nefk?t=3256) absolutely do you see that in the case  
[0:54:18](https://youtu.be/v4-FUP5Nefk?t=3258) i mean there is a time where i do this  
[0:54:20](https://youtu.be/v4-FUP5Nefk?t=3260) with her because i feel that if i spoil  
[0:54:21](https://youtu.be/v4-FUP5Nefk?t=3261) her i'm doing her the series to be  
[0:54:23](https://youtu.be/v4-FUP5Nefk?t=3263) honest there is a time i draw a hard  
[0:54:24](https://youtu.be/v4-FUP5Nefk?t=3264) line but i do spoil her every time i  
[0:54:26](https://youtu.be/v4-FUP5Nefk?t=3266) travel i bring her back gifts i shower  
[0:54:28](https://youtu.be/v4-FUP5Nefk?t=3268) with love i take care of my daughter my  
[0:54:30](https://youtu.be/v4-FUP5Nefk?t=3270) daughter is number one yeah  
[0:54:32](https://youtu.be/v4-FUP5Nefk?t=3272) but there's a time i have to draw the  
[0:54:33](https://youtu.be/v4-FUP5Nefk?t=3273) line i have to discipline her i think  
[0:54:34](https://youtu.be/v4-FUP5Nefk?t=3274) it's it's just because it's for her own  
[0:54:36](https://youtu.be/v4-FUP5Nefk?t=3276) good yeah  
[0:54:37](https://youtu.be/v4-FUP5Nefk?t=3277) and  
[0:54:38](https://youtu.be/v4-FUP5Nefk?t=3278) or else she'll become spoiled right  
[0:54:40](https://youtu.be/v4-FUP5Nefk?t=3280) spoiled and that's it's very important  
[0:54:41](https://youtu.be/v4-FUP5Nefk?t=3281) that she's not you know because then one  
[0:54:42](https://youtu.be/v4-FUP5Nefk?t=3282) day  
[0:54:43](https://youtu.be/v4-FUP5Nefk?t=3283) she'll have difficulty functioning in  
[0:54:45](https://youtu.be/v4-FUP5Nefk?t=3285) society yeah it's not always about her  
[0:54:47](https://youtu.be/v4-FUP5Nefk?t=3287) you know she's got to know that yeah we  
[0:54:49](https://youtu.be/v4-FUP5Nefk?t=3289) have this playful time where i make it  
[0:54:51](https://youtu.be/v4-FUP5Nefk?t=3291) all about you but then we get serious  
[0:54:52](https://youtu.be/v4-FUP5Nefk?t=3292) and look everybody waits their turn  
[0:54:54](https://youtu.be/v4-FUP5Nefk?t=3294) everybody gets their fair share and you  
[0:54:55](https://youtu.be/v4-FUP5Nefk?t=3295) have to you know get out get with the  
[0:54:56](https://youtu.be/v4-FUP5Nefk?t=3296) program uh  
[0:54:58](https://youtu.be/v4-FUP5Nefk?t=3298) the idea is that in the future she's  
[0:55:00](https://youtu.be/v4-FUP5Nefk?t=3300) gonna marry a guy who takes care of her  
[0:55:02](https://youtu.be/v4-FUP5Nefk?t=3302) like her father takes care of her she  
[0:55:03](https://youtu.be/v4-FUP5Nefk?t=3303) has a map in her mind she knows how it  
[0:55:04](https://youtu.be/v4-FUP5Nefk?t=3304) feels to be treated well and that's how  
[0:55:06](https://youtu.be/v4-FUP5Nefk?t=3306) it should feel if she's going to marry  
[0:55:08](https://youtu.be/v4-FUP5Nefk?t=3308) somebody  
[0:55:09](https://youtu.be/v4-FUP5Nefk?t=3309) um i take my i make my sons take care of  
[0:55:11](https://youtu.be/v4-FUP5Nefk?t=3311) her because one day when i die they're  
[0:55:12](https://youtu.be/v4-FUP5Nefk?t=3312) going to take care of her it's a reflex  
[0:55:14](https://youtu.be/v4-FUP5Nefk?t=3314) she needs something i said her brother  
[0:55:16](https://youtu.be/v4-FUP5Nefk?t=3316) kind of things would you say to your  
[0:55:17](https://youtu.be/v4-FUP5Nefk?t=3317) sons  
[0:55:18](https://youtu.be/v4-FUP5Nefk?t=3318) absolutely if if i hear my baby girl  
[0:55:20](https://youtu.be/v4-FUP5Nefk?t=3320) crying and my sons don't get up  
[0:55:22](https://youtu.be/v4-FUP5Nefk?t=3322) to check on her it's gonna be a problem  
[0:55:24](https://youtu.be/v4-FUP5Nefk?t=3324) on that level oh yeah if she's in if  
[0:55:26](https://youtu.be/v4-FUP5Nefk?t=3326) she's in pain or she needs help or she  
[0:55:28](https://youtu.be/v4-FUP5Nefk?t=3328) there's no toilet paper they got to get  
[0:55:29](https://youtu.be/v4-FUP5Nefk?t=3329) up and go get it for her like  
[0:55:31](https://youtu.be/v4-FUP5Nefk?t=3331) they better get up right now and do it  
[0:55:33](https://youtu.be/v4-FUP5Nefk?t=3333) why because i want to cultivate in them  
[0:55:34](https://youtu.be/v4-FUP5Nefk?t=3334) a sense that she's the most important  
[0:55:36](https://youtu.be/v4-FUP5Nefk?t=3336) person in in our lives and you have to  
[0:55:38](https://youtu.be/v4-FUP5Nefk?t=3338) take care of her why she's the youngest  
[0:55:40](https://youtu.be/v4-FUP5Nefk?t=3340) okay she's younger she's the baby girl

[0:55:45](https://youtu.be/v4-FUP5Nefk?t=3345) she wasn't the youngest there would be  
[0:55:46](https://youtu.be/v4-FUP5Nefk?t=3346) more you would say there's being more

[0:56:45](https://youtu.be/v4-FUP5Nefk?t=3405) gave you his time now do something at  
[0:56:47](https://youtu.be/v4-FUP5Nefk?t=3407) rounds or three three no five minute  
[0:56:48](https://youtu.be/v4-FUP5Nefk?t=3408) rounds we'll do five minute rounds do  
[0:56:49](https://youtu.be/v4-FUP5Nefk?t=3409) you ever do do you ever do full fully  
[0:56:51](https://youtu.be/v4-FUP5Nefk?t=3411) fledged sparring uh no no no the kids no  
[0:56:53](https://youtu.be/v4-FUP5Nefk?t=3413) no no no no no no just just grappling uh  
[0:56:55](https://youtu.be/v4-FUP5Nefk?t=3415) graphic we do body shot sparring i'm a  
[0:56:57](https://youtu.be/v4-FUP5Nefk?t=3417) big believer in the kyokushin style  
[0:56:58](https://youtu.be/v4-FUP5Nefk?t=3418) system like if you look at george grew  
[0:56:59](https://youtu.be/v4-FUP5Nefk?t=3419) up in that system where they kick and  
[0:57:01](https://youtu.be/v4-FUP5Nefk?t=3421) punch to the body really and then later  
[0:57:03](https://youtu.be/v4-FUP5Nefk?t=3423) as they're older they teach some  
[0:57:04](https://youtu.be/v4-FUP5Nefk?t=3424) striking to their head do you not think  
[0:57:06](https://youtu.be/v4-FUP5Nefk?t=3426) that one of the drawbacks of that system  
[0:57:07](https://youtu.be/v4-FUP5Nefk?t=3427) is that if you learn to punch the body  
[0:57:10](https://youtu.be/v4-FUP5Nefk?t=3430) and defend to the body that when you go  
[0:57:12](https://youtu.be/v4-FUP5Nefk?t=3432) and do sparring  
[0:57:13](https://youtu.be/v4-FUP5Nefk?t=3433) fully fledged that your defenses will be  
[0:57:15](https://youtu.be/v4-FUP5Nefk?t=3435) they quickly catch up are you sure yeah  
[0:57:17](https://youtu.be/v4-FUP5Nefk?t=3437) absolutely because  
[0:57:20](https://youtu.be/v4-FUP5Nefk?t=3440) there's many world champions in k1 that  
[0:57:22](https://youtu.be/v4-FUP5Nefk?t=3442) came from a karate background that had  
[0:57:23](https://youtu.be/v4-FUP5Nefk?t=3443) hard time early in the beginning then  
[0:57:25](https://youtu.be/v4-FUP5Nefk?t=3445) they adopted boxing and george is one of  
[0:57:26](https://youtu.be/v4-FUP5Nefk?t=3446) them george exactly like this he had a  
[0:57:27](https://youtu.be/v4-FUP5Nefk?t=3447) great kicking and punching to the body  
[0:57:29](https://youtu.be/v4-FUP5Nefk?t=3449) but no punching to the head it was very  
[0:57:30](https://youtu.be/v4-FUP5Nefk?t=3450) easy to hit he quickly transformed why  
[0:57:32](https://youtu.be/v4-FUP5Nefk?t=3452) because it's very similar  
[0:57:34](https://youtu.be/v4-FUP5Nefk?t=3454) and it's it's just basically you're  
[0:57:36](https://youtu.be/v4-FUP5Nefk?t=3456) putting the icing on the cake it's not  
[0:57:37](https://youtu.be/v4-FUP5Nefk?t=3457) really you're you're not building the  
[0:57:38](https://youtu.be/v4-FUP5Nefk?t=3458) whole idea of reflexes and distance  
[0:57:40](https://youtu.be/v4-FUP5Nefk?t=3460) control and the thing is because they  
[0:57:42](https://youtu.be/v4-FUP5Nefk?t=3462) haven't gotten hit in the head their  
[0:57:43](https://youtu.be/v4-FUP5Nefk?t=3463) mind is completely well developed and  
[0:57:45](https://youtu.be/v4-FUP5Nefk?t=3465) clear  
[0:57:46](https://youtu.be/v4-FUP5Nefk?t=3466) you know so i really believe in the  
[0:57:48](https://youtu.be/v4-FUP5Nefk?t=3468) system i think it's fantastic because  
[0:57:49](https://youtu.be/v4-FUP5Nefk?t=3469) you learn how to kick punch distance  
[0:57:51](https://youtu.be/v4-FUP5Nefk?t=3471) control and actually it's more painful  
[0:57:53](https://youtu.be/v4-FUP5Nefk?t=3473) to get hit in the body than the head the  
[0:57:54](https://youtu.be/v4-FUP5Nefk?t=3474) head you don't really feel anything and  
[0:57:56](https://youtu.be/v4-FUP5Nefk?t=3476) just you might see a spark here and  
[0:57:57](https://youtu.be/v4-FUP5Nefk?t=3477) there a star here and there but you  
[0:57:59](https://youtu.be/v4-FUP5Nefk?t=3479) don't feel pain like getting in the body  
[0:58:00](https://youtu.be/v4-FUP5Nefk?t=3480) so they're actually more resistant to  
[0:58:01](https://youtu.be/v4-FUP5Nefk?t=3481) pain  
[0:58:02](https://youtu.be/v4-FUP5Nefk?t=3482) and they're less likely to head hunt  
[0:58:03](https://youtu.be/v4-FUP5Nefk?t=3483) because they've been hitting the body  
[0:58:04](https://youtu.be/v4-FUP5Nefk?t=3484) their entire life  
[0:58:06](https://youtu.be/v4-FUP5Nefk?t=3486) it's a brilliant system i think it's  
[0:58:07](https://youtu.be/v4-FUP5Nefk?t=3487) very very good and i think  
[0:58:09](https://youtu.be/v4-FUP5Nefk?t=3489) well  
[0:58:09](https://youtu.be/v4-FUP5Nefk?t=3489) in kyokushin karate  
[0:58:12](https://youtu.be/v4-FUP5Nefk?t=3492) the karate system because they're they  
[0:58:13](https://youtu.be/v4-FUP5Nefk?t=3493) start in the youth they only attack the  
[0:58:15](https://youtu.be/v4-FUP5Nefk?t=3495) body even in taekwondo they just they  
[0:58:17](https://youtu.be/v4-FUP5Nefk?t=3497) put a shield on the body and you can hit  
[0:58:19](https://youtu.be/v4-FUP5Nefk?t=3499) the body as hard as you want right okay  
[0:58:21](https://youtu.be/v4-FUP5Nefk?t=3501) well not not every kyokushin tournament  
[0:58:24](https://youtu.be/v4-FUP5Nefk?t=3504) is as hard as you want they have  
[0:58:25](https://youtu.be/v4-FUP5Nefk?t=3505) somewhere you're not allowed to hit as  
[0:58:26](https://youtu.be/v4-FUP5Nefk?t=3506) hard as you want but it's very very safe  
[0:58:28](https://youtu.be/v4-FUP5Nefk?t=3508) for the brain like the worst you can get  
[0:58:30](https://youtu.be/v4-FUP5Nefk?t=3510) is  
[0:58:31](https://youtu.be/v4-FUP5Nefk?t=3511) really hard on the body and winded  
[0:58:32](https://youtu.be/v4-FUP5Nefk?t=3512) mm-hmm so basically you run out of you  
[0:58:34](https://youtu.be/v4-FUP5Nefk?t=3514) get dropped to your knees and you can't  
[0:58:35](https://youtu.be/v4-FUP5Nefk?t=3515) breathe for a second or two and it's  
[0:58:37](https://youtu.be/v4-FUP5Nefk?t=3517) very rare but it's nothing serious and  
[0:58:39](https://youtu.be/v4-FUP5Nefk?t=3519) george came from that background  
[0:58:40](https://youtu.be/v4-FUP5Nefk?t=3520) absolutely he became world champion  
[0:58:41](https://youtu.be/v4-FUP5Nefk?t=3521) that's why i'm telling people it's  
[0:58:42](https://youtu.be/v4-FUP5Nefk?t=3522) better to do it that way  
[0:58:44](https://youtu.be/v4-FUP5Nefk?t=3524) then because if you look at boxers and  
[0:58:46](https://youtu.be/v4-FUP5Nefk?t=3526) muay thai fighters after they're retired  
[0:58:48](https://youtu.be/v4-FUP5Nefk?t=3528) the ones who started very very young a  
[0:58:50](https://youtu.be/v4-FUP5Nefk?t=3530) lot of them unfortunately become  
[0:58:51](https://youtu.be/v4-FUP5Nefk?t=3531) alcoholics  
[0:58:52](https://youtu.be/v4-FUP5Nefk?t=3532) dysfunctional they're completely  
[0:58:54](https://youtu.be/v4-FUP5Nefk?t=3534) dysfunctional they can't go into society  
[0:58:56](https://youtu.be/v4-FUP5Nefk?t=3536) why  
[0:58:58](https://youtu.be/v4-FUP5Nefk?t=3538) the way that they explain it the way  
[0:58:59](https://youtu.be/v4-FUP5Nefk?t=3539) i've heard it to be explained is that  
[0:59:02](https://youtu.be/v4-FUP5Nefk?t=3542) when you get hit in the head often  
[0:59:04](https://youtu.be/v4-FUP5Nefk?t=3544) the brain the receptor in your brain is  
[0:59:06](https://youtu.be/v4-FUP5Nefk?t=3546) not as  
[0:59:07](https://youtu.be/v4-FUP5Nefk?t=3547) efficient it's not as sensitive so what  
[0:59:09](https://youtu.be/v4-FUP5Nefk?t=3549) happens  
[0:59:11](https://youtu.be/v4-FUP5Nefk?t=3551) if a hundred is feeling normal they're  
[0:59:13](https://youtu.be/v4-FUP5Nefk?t=3553) at 80.  
[0:59:15](https://youtu.be/v4-FUP5Nefk?t=3555) so they need a substance a self-medicate  
[0:59:16](https://youtu.be/v4-FUP5Nefk?t=3556) they say they take drugs or alcohol to  
[0:59:18](https://youtu.be/v4-FUP5Nefk?t=3558) bring them up to just a hundred just to  
[0:59:20](https://youtu.be/v4-FUP5Nefk?t=3560) feel normal  
[0:59:21](https://youtu.be/v4-FUP5Nefk?t=3561) and i don't know if this narrative is  
[0:59:23](https://youtu.be/v4-FUP5Nefk?t=3563) true you know i've heard experts say  
[0:59:25](https://youtu.be/v4-FUP5Nefk?t=3565) this but i i can't say that i have no  
[0:59:26](https://youtu.be/v4-FUP5Nefk?t=3566) studies  
[0:59:28](https://youtu.be/v4-FUP5Nefk?t=3568) explains this for a fact but  
[0:59:30](https://youtu.be/v4-FUP5Nefk?t=3570) i've definitely noticed a trend that  
[0:59:31](https://youtu.be/v4-FUP5Nefk?t=3571) ex-boxers are not functional after yeah  
[0:59:34](https://youtu.be/v4-FUP5Nefk?t=3574) i've seen yeah i've i've been in  
[0:59:35](https://youtu.be/v4-FUP5Nefk?t=3575) thailand believe me i've been i've been  
[0:59:37](https://youtu.be/v4-FUP5Nefk?t=3577) in the thick of it okay  
[0:59:38](https://youtu.be/v4-FUP5Nefk?t=3578) land they they retire like 32 or  
[0:59:40](https://youtu.be/v4-FUP5Nefk?t=3580) something right younger 526 yeah because  
[0:59:43](https://youtu.be/v4-FUP5Nefk?t=3583) it's just too much is it because they  
[0:59:45](https://youtu.be/v4-FUP5Nefk?t=3585) used to be on the stage and now they  
[0:59:46](https://youtu.be/v4-FUP5Nefk?t=3586) have they have a regular job and that's  
[0:59:47](https://youtu.be/v4-FUP5Nefk?t=3587) what's depressing them i don't know i  
[0:59:49](https://youtu.be/v4-FUP5Nefk?t=3589) can't tell you that either narrative is  
[0:59:50](https://youtu.be/v4-FUP5Nefk?t=3590) true i don't know for a fact i thought  
[0:59:52](https://youtu.be/v4-FUP5Nefk?t=3592) it was because their bodies had had  
[0:59:53](https://youtu.be/v4-FUP5Nefk?t=3593) enough i think it has a lot to do with  
[0:59:54](https://youtu.be/v4-FUP5Nefk?t=3594) blows to the head is that yeah yeah um  
[0:59:57](https://youtu.be/v4-FUP5Nefk?t=3597) i think excessive looks to the head  
[0:59:58](https://youtu.be/v4-FUP5Nefk?t=3598) don't forget they do with elbows kicks  
[1:00:00](https://youtu.be/v4-FUP5Nefk?t=3600) to the head it's brutal yeah that's why  
[1:00:02](https://youtu.be/v4-FUP5Nefk?t=3602) i'm very sensitive to that issue your  
[1:00:04](https://youtu.be/v4-FUP5Nefk?t=3604) brain is developing because the thing is  
[1:00:05](https://youtu.be/v4-FUP5Nefk?t=3605) in thailand they make them fight with  
[1:00:07](https://youtu.be/v4-FUP5Nefk?t=3607) elbows and knees as kids like we're  
[1:00:09](https://youtu.be/v4-FUP5Nefk?t=3609) talking about seven-year-old  
[1:00:10](https://youtu.be/v4-FUP5Nefk?t=3610) eight-year-old six years old  
[1:00:11](https://youtu.be/v4-FUP5Nefk?t=3611) and they make them cut weight who knows  
[1:00:14](https://youtu.be/v4-FUP5Nefk?t=3614) what that does to your organs and brain  
[1:00:15](https://youtu.be/v4-FUP5Nefk?t=3615) i don't know what it does there's no  
[1:00:16](https://youtu.be/v4-FUP5Nefk?t=3616) study that tells you there's no study  
[1:00:18](https://youtu.be/v4-FUP5Nefk?t=3618) following kids cutting weight so i think  
[1:00:20](https://youtu.be/v4-FUP5Nefk?t=3620) it's too much i rather my kids have a  
[1:00:22](https://youtu.be/v4-FUP5Nefk?t=3622) development yeah their bodies fully  
[1:00:24](https://youtu.be/v4-FUP5Nefk?t=3624) developed and then i'll add them to  
[1:00:26](https://youtu.be/v4-FUP5Nefk?t=3626) these do you know an mma there are two  
[1:00:28](https://youtu.be/v4-FUP5Nefk?t=3628) kind of if you want to call them that  
[1:00:29](https://youtu.be/v4-FUP5Nefk?t=3629) schools of thought someone's come from a  
[1:00:31](https://youtu.be/v4-FUP5Nefk?t=3631) specialist background and then they  
[1:00:32](https://youtu.be/v4-FUP5Nefk?t=3632) learn the other two or three sports  
[1:00:34](https://youtu.be/v4-FUP5Nefk?t=3634) whatever they're gonna learn all  
[1:00:35](https://youtu.be/v4-FUP5Nefk?t=3635) together and someone who's trying to be  
[1:00:37](https://youtu.be/v4-FUP5Nefk?t=3637) a generalist  
[1:00:38](https://youtu.be/v4-FUP5Nefk?t=3638) in terms of effectiveness  
[1:00:40](https://youtu.be/v4-FUP5Nefk?t=3640) and general efficacy who what do you  
[1:00:42](https://youtu.be/v4-FUP5Nefk?t=3642) think other like where has success been  
[1:00:45](https://youtu.be/v4-FUP5Nefk?t=3645) more seen  
[1:00:46](https://youtu.be/v4-FUP5Nefk?t=3646) people that have for example freestyle  
[1:00:48](https://youtu.be/v4-FUP5Nefk?t=3648) wrestling backgrounds and then they come  
[1:00:49](https://youtu.be/v4-FUP5Nefk?t=3649) and they learn like a bit of striking  
[1:00:51](https://youtu.be/v4-FUP5Nefk?t=3651) and  
[1:00:52](https://youtu.be/v4-FUP5Nefk?t=3652) jiu-jitsu or someone who's trying to do  
[1:00:54](https://youtu.be/v4-FUP5Nefk?t=3654) all three at the same time um i would  
[1:00:56](https://youtu.be/v4-FUP5Nefk?t=3656) recommend doing wrestling and jiu jitsu  
[1:00:58](https://youtu.be/v4-FUP5Nefk?t=3658) first  
[1:00:59](https://youtu.be/v4-FUP5Nefk?t=3659) wrestling in jitsu shouldn't be  
[1:01:00](https://youtu.be/v4-FUP5Nefk?t=3660) separated  
[1:01:01](https://youtu.be/v4-FUP5Nefk?t=3661) and do that because you're gonna build  
[1:01:03](https://youtu.be/v4-FUP5Nefk?t=3663) an athleticism the wrestlers have a  
[1:01:04](https://youtu.be/v4-FUP5Nefk?t=3664) better athleticism  
[1:01:06](https://youtu.be/v4-FUP5Nefk?t=3666) then let's go into striking  
[1:01:08](https://youtu.be/v4-FUP5Nefk?t=3668) and i'll quick quick what age is always  
[1:01:10](https://youtu.be/v4-FUP5Nefk?t=3670) talking about here  
[1:01:11](https://youtu.be/v4-FUP5Nefk?t=3671) i would say look after your brain  
[1:01:12](https://youtu.be/v4-FUP5Nefk?t=3672) finishes developing i would teach my  
[1:01:14](https://youtu.be/v4-FUP5Nefk?t=3674) kids how to hit the bag earlier on like  
[1:01:16](https://youtu.be/v4-FUP5Nefk?t=3676) my kids they don't do a lot of striking  
[1:01:18](https://youtu.be/v4-FUP5Nefk?t=3678) they do a lot of wrestling in jiu jitsu  
[1:01:19](https://youtu.be/v4-FUP5Nefk?t=3679) and then i make them hit the back let's  
[1:01:20](https://youtu.be/v4-FUP5Nefk?t=3680) say once a week once every two weeks  
[1:01:22](https://youtu.be/v4-FUP5Nefk?t=3682) just so they can develop that  
[1:01:24](https://youtu.be/v4-FUP5Nefk?t=3684) coordination when they're young  
[1:01:25](https://youtu.be/v4-FUP5Nefk?t=3685) because we've seen world champions pick  
[1:01:27](https://youtu.be/v4-FUP5Nefk?t=3687) up kickboxing at the age of 14 and  
[1:01:29](https://youtu.be/v4-FUP5Nefk?t=3689) become world champion by the time  
[1:01:30](https://youtu.be/v4-FUP5Nefk?t=3690) they're 25.  
[1:01:31](https://youtu.be/v4-FUP5Nefk?t=3691) what happened he learned in such a short  
[1:01:32](https://youtu.be/v4-FUP5Nefk?t=3692) period well it doesn't take that long  
[1:01:35](https://youtu.be/v4-FUP5Nefk?t=3695) it's not that it takes forever to learn  
[1:01:36](https://youtu.be/v4-FUP5Nefk?t=3696) however  
[1:01:37](https://youtu.be/v4-FUP5Nefk?t=3697) jiu jitsu is complicated yeah  
[1:01:40](https://youtu.be/v4-FUP5Nefk?t=3700) and wrestling is there's a lot of  
[1:01:43](https://youtu.be/v4-FUP5Nefk?t=3703) uh possibilities whereas in kickboxing  
[1:01:45](https://youtu.be/v4-FUP5Nefk?t=3705) and muay thai  
[1:01:47](https://youtu.be/v4-FUP5Nefk?t=3707) it's more about speeding timing the  
[1:01:48](https://youtu.be/v4-FUP5Nefk?t=3708) possibilities are not that complicated  
[1:01:50](https://youtu.be/v4-FUP5Nefk?t=3710) comparatively comparatively don't forget  
[1:01:52](https://youtu.be/v4-FUP5Nefk?t=3712) and jiu jitsu jesus there's so many  
[1:01:54](https://youtu.be/v4-FUP5Nefk?t=3714) nuances there's so many positions so  
[1:01:55](https://youtu.be/v4-FUP5Nefk?t=3715) many things you have to learn cerebrally  
[1:01:58](https://youtu.be/v4-FUP5Nefk?t=3718) now boxing is also you know there's a  
[1:02:00](https://youtu.be/v4-FUP5Nefk?t=3720) lot of detail but nowhere near nobody  
[1:02:02](https://youtu.be/v4-FUP5Nefk?t=3722) can the possibilities in wrestling in  
[1:02:03](https://youtu.be/v4-FUP5Nefk?t=3723) jujitsu are far greater than striking  
[1:02:07](https://youtu.be/v4-FUP5Nefk?t=3727) i i i saw a video of john jones one time  
[1:02:09](https://youtu.be/v4-FUP5Nefk?t=3729) he was asking what's the most potent  
[1:02:12](https://youtu.be/v4-FUP5Nefk?t=3732) sport um kind of martial in the sport  
[1:02:14](https://youtu.be/v4-FUP5Nefk?t=3734) and he said it was freestyle wrestling  
[1:02:16](https://youtu.be/v4-FUP5Nefk?t=3736) to what extent do you agree that if you  
[1:02:17](https://youtu.be/v4-FUP5Nefk?t=3737) have a time limit i would say yeah it  
[1:02:19](https://youtu.be/v4-FUP5Nefk?t=3739) makes sense if there's no time limit  
[1:02:20](https://youtu.be/v4-FUP5Nefk?t=3740) it's jiu jitsu right because look jiu  
[1:02:23](https://youtu.be/v4-FUP5Nefk?t=3743) jitsu was developed in the time of vale  
[1:02:24](https://youtu.be/v4-FUP5Nefk?t=3744) tudor valley tutorial means anything  
[1:02:26](https://youtu.be/v4-FUP5Nefk?t=3746) goes me and you would fight but there's  
[1:02:27](https://youtu.be/v4-FUP5Nefk?t=3747) no time limit the winner gets the  
[1:02:28](https://youtu.be/v4-FUP5Nefk?t=3748) videotape that's how it was  
[1:02:30](https://youtu.be/v4-FUP5Nefk?t=3750) fights will last two three hours so what  
[1:02:32](https://youtu.be/v4-FUP5Nefk?t=3752) you took me down so what however if you  
[1:02:34](https://youtu.be/v4-FUP5Nefk?t=3754) take me down and there's only two  
[1:02:35](https://youtu.be/v4-FUP5Nefk?t=3755) minutes left on the clock  
[1:02:37](https://youtu.be/v4-FUP5Nefk?t=3757) and you just fend off my submissions and  
[1:02:39](https://youtu.be/v4-FUP5Nefk?t=3759) you just kind of hold me tight and you  
[1:02:40](https://youtu.be/v4-FUP5Nefk?t=3760) just and the bell rings they give you  
[1:02:42](https://youtu.be/v4-FUP5Nefk?t=3762) the round you read  
[1:02:44](https://youtu.be/v4-FUP5Nefk?t=3764) you repeat the process two more times  
[1:02:45](https://youtu.be/v4-FUP5Nefk?t=3765) and you win  
[1:02:46](https://youtu.be/v4-FUP5Nefk?t=3766) however that's just 15 minutes  
[1:02:48](https://youtu.be/v4-FUP5Nefk?t=3768) that's not a long time for two guys to  
[1:02:50](https://youtu.be/v4-FUP5Nefk?t=3770) find out who's a better fighter now  
[1:02:52](https://youtu.be/v4-FUP5Nefk?t=3772) let's say that let's say we made it  
[1:02:53](https://youtu.be/v4-FUP5Nefk?t=3773) unlimited rounds and the fighter the  
[1:02:55](https://youtu.be/v4-FUP5Nefk?t=3775) wrestler gets subbed in seventh round  
[1:02:57](https://youtu.be/v4-FUP5Nefk?t=3777) you'll be like oh the grappler is better  
[1:02:59](https://youtu.be/v4-FUP5Nefk?t=3779) yeah but you didn't get to the seventh  
[1:03:00](https://youtu.be/v4-FUP5Nefk?t=3780) round in competition night you only saw  
[1:03:02](https://youtu.be/v4-FUP5Nefk?t=3782) the first three  
[1:03:03](https://youtu.be/v4-FUP5Nefk?t=3783) because believe me when i tell you  
[1:03:05](https://youtu.be/v4-FUP5Nefk?t=3785) um  
[1:03:06](https://youtu.be/v4-FUP5Nefk?t=3786) the wrestlers don't have a way to end  
[1:03:07](https://youtu.be/v4-FUP5Nefk?t=3787) the fight often  
[1:03:09](https://youtu.be/v4-FUP5Nefk?t=3789) so i've seen many fights where there was  
[1:03:11](https://youtu.be/v4-FUP5Nefk?t=3791) no time limit and the wrestler gets  
[1:03:13](https://youtu.be/v4-FUP5Nefk?t=3793) subbed or knocked out or hurt because he  
[1:03:15](https://youtu.be/v4-FUP5Nefk?t=3795) just had no way to end the fight he can  
[1:03:16](https://youtu.be/v4-FUP5Nefk?t=3796) get the guy down he can't do anything  
[1:03:17](https://youtu.be/v4-FUP5Nefk?t=3797) about it it takes years to refine how to  
[1:03:19](https://youtu.be/v4-FUP5Nefk?t=3799) pass their guard mount them take their  
[1:03:20](https://youtu.be/v4-FUP5Nefk?t=3800) back etc  
[1:03:21](https://youtu.be/v4-FUP5Nefk?t=3801) so  
[1:03:23](https://youtu.be/v4-FUP5Nefk?t=3803) with because we've made it more of a  
[1:03:24](https://youtu.be/v4-FUP5Nefk?t=3804) sport it's more time sensitive i would  
[1:03:26](https://youtu.be/v4-FUP5Nefk?t=3806) say yes makes sense  
[1:03:28](https://youtu.be/v4-FUP5Nefk?t=3808) and on this point what do you think with  
[1:03:30](https://youtu.be/v4-FUP5Nefk?t=3810) the whole comes out hamza chameleo and  
[1:03:34](https://youtu.be/v4-FUP5Nefk?t=3814) burns  
[1:03:35](https://youtu.be/v4-FUP5Nefk?t=3815) if it becomes a grappling affair then on  
[1:03:37](https://youtu.be/v4-FUP5Nefk?t=3817) this analysis it should favor burns  
[1:03:39](https://youtu.be/v4-FUP5Nefk?t=3819) because then he could yeah but because  
[1:03:41](https://youtu.be/v4-FUP5Nefk?t=3821) of the time limit i don't think there's  
[1:03:42](https://youtu.be/v4-FUP5Nefk?t=3822) much you can do like you have to look  
[1:03:43](https://youtu.be/v4-FUP5Nefk?t=3823) the better the guy is the more sequences  
[1:03:45](https://youtu.be/v4-FUP5Nefk?t=3825) i need to trap him  
[1:03:47](https://youtu.be/v4-FUP5Nefk?t=3827) and the guy knows that so what he's  
[1:03:48](https://youtu.be/v4-FUP5Nefk?t=3828) going to stall he's going to have stall  
[1:03:49](https://youtu.be/v4-FUP5Nefk?t=3829) tactics he's not even going to do the  
[1:03:51](https://youtu.be/v4-FUP5Nefk?t=3831) sequences he knows that if he keeps  
[1:03:52](https://youtu.be/v4-FUP5Nefk?t=3832) breaking grips keep interrupting the  
[1:03:53](https://youtu.be/v4-FUP5Nefk?t=3833) sequences he can eventually kill the  
[1:03:56](https://youtu.be/v4-FUP5Nefk?t=3836) time so what do you think's going to  
[1:03:57](https://youtu.be/v4-FUP5Nefk?t=3837) happen i think comes that's going to win  
[1:03:58](https://youtu.be/v4-FUP5Nefk?t=3838) it's going to be a stand-up affair is it  
[1:04:00](https://youtu.be/v4-FUP5Nefk?t=3840) yeah i think he has the reach the power  
[1:04:02](https://youtu.be/v4-FUP5Nefk?t=3842) the the the distance he's assault pots  
[1:04:04](https://youtu.be/v4-FUP5Nefk?t=3844) and open stance it could be harder for  
[1:04:06](https://youtu.be/v4-FUP5Nefk?t=3846) uh bernstein he's a blue belt compared  
[1:04:08](https://youtu.be/v4-FUP5Nefk?t=3848) to yeah but  
[1:04:09](https://youtu.be/v4-FUP5Nefk?t=3849) that's that's misleading because he's  
[1:04:11](https://youtu.be/v4-FUP5Nefk?t=3851) been wrestling his whole life and people  
[1:04:12](https://youtu.be/v4-FUP5Nefk?t=3852) think wrestlers don't do ground that's  
[1:04:13](https://youtu.be/v4-FUP5Nefk?t=3853) not true  
[1:04:14](https://youtu.be/v4-FUP5Nefk?t=3854) see the fatal flaw in jiu jitsu is that  
[1:04:15](https://youtu.be/v4-FUP5Nefk?t=3855) they do just ground a lot of them like  
[1:04:17](https://youtu.be/v4-FUP5Nefk?t=3857) in my academy we do standing and we do  
[1:04:19](https://youtu.be/v4-FUP5Nefk?t=3859) ground  
[1:04:20](https://youtu.be/v4-FUP5Nefk?t=3860) wrestlers do standing and ground it's a  
[1:04:21](https://youtu.be/v4-FUP5Nefk?t=3861) myth that they don't it's it's not true  
[1:04:23](https://youtu.be/v4-FUP5Nefk?t=3863) that they do a different type of ground  
[1:04:25](https://youtu.be/v4-FUP5Nefk?t=3865) but it's very relevant to what we do on  
[1:04:27](https://youtu.be/v4-FUP5Nefk?t=3867) mma but  
[1:04:28](https://youtu.be/v4-FUP5Nefk?t=3868) with the difference being with um anklev  
[1:04:30](https://youtu.be/v4-FUP5Nefk?t=3870) and um  
[1:04:32](https://youtu.be/v4-FUP5Nefk?t=3872) khabib is that they did right  
[1:04:34](https://youtu.be/v4-FUP5Nefk?t=3874) whereas  
[1:04:35](https://youtu.be/v4-FUP5Nefk?t=3875) whereas whereas hamza is coming from a  
[1:04:36](https://youtu.be/v4-FUP5Nefk?t=3876) freestyle restaurant but freestyle they  
[1:04:38](https://youtu.be/v4-FUP5Nefk?t=3878) do ground  
[1:04:39](https://youtu.be/v4-FUP5Nefk?t=3879) yeah but they do like what you call it  
[1:04:41](https://youtu.be/v4-FUP5Nefk?t=3881) gut wrench etc that's plenty they do a  
[1:04:43](https://youtu.be/v4-FUP5Nefk?t=3883) lot of ground there is a lot of ground  
[1:04:45](https://youtu.be/v4-FUP5Nefk?t=3885) so they know how to control their  
[1:04:47](https://youtu.be/v4-FUP5Nefk?t=3887) balance they know how to hold you down  
[1:04:48](https://youtu.be/v4-FUP5Nefk?t=3888) from getting up i don't think it's going  
[1:04:50](https://youtu.be/v4-FUP5Nefk?t=3890) to be too much of a ground affair would  
[1:04:51](https://youtu.be/v4-FUP5Nefk?t=3891) surprise me i mean nothing's impossible  
[1:04:52](https://youtu.be/v4-FUP5Nefk?t=3892) but i think it's a it's a good very good  
[1:04:54](https://youtu.be/v4-FUP5Nefk?t=3894) hamsa it's a very good fight for him  
[1:04:56](https://youtu.be/v4-FUP5Nefk?t=3896) it's gonna be interesting i think if he  
[1:04:57](https://youtu.be/v4-FUP5Nefk?t=3897) gets through this one  
[1:04:58](https://youtu.be/v4-FUP5Nefk?t=3898) you know a very yeah i thought martial  
[1:05:00](https://youtu.be/v4-FUP5Nefk?t=3900) is a world champion or in ibj  
[1:05:03](https://youtu.be/v4-FUP5Nefk?t=3903) burns ah burns he is right so if he gets  
[1:05:05](https://youtu.be/v4-FUP5Nefk?t=3905) through him i think that would  
[1:05:07](https://youtu.be/v4-FUP5Nefk?t=3907) definitely mean that he's  
[1:05:08](https://youtu.be/v4-FUP5Nefk?t=3908) i think one of the top guys there i  
[1:05:10](https://youtu.be/v4-FUP5Nefk?t=3910) think the winner is going to get kobe  
[1:05:11](https://youtu.be/v4-FUP5Nefk?t=3911) covington  
[1:05:13](https://youtu.be/v4-FUP5Nefk?t=3913) hamzat or  
[1:05:14](https://youtu.be/v4-FUP5Nefk?t=3914) burns  
[1:05:15](https://youtu.be/v4-FUP5Nefk?t=3915) both of them i think either whoever wins  
[1:05:17](https://youtu.be/v4-FUP5Nefk?t=3917) the fight gets kobe and the winner of  
[1:05:18](https://youtu.be/v4-FUP5Nefk?t=3918) kobe versus  
[1:05:19](https://youtu.be/v4-FUP5Nefk?t=3919) kamza go back tomorrow or yeah i think  
[1:05:22](https://youtu.be/v4-FUP5Nefk?t=3922) we'll go to camaro but even then if it's  
[1:05:26](https://youtu.be/v4-FUP5Nefk?t=3926) the thing is if kobe wins would they do  
[1:05:27](https://youtu.be/v4-FUP5Nefk?t=3927) a third time  
[1:05:29](https://youtu.be/v4-FUP5Nefk?t=3929) it's boring isn't it it's it's  
[1:05:31](https://youtu.be/v4-FUP5Nefk?t=3931) i think it wouldn't sell yeah i mean  
[1:05:33](https://youtu.be/v4-FUP5Nefk?t=3933) yeah i mean i would watch it but i don't  
[1:05:34](https://youtu.be/v4-FUP5Nefk?t=3934) know if it's cell because he lost twice  
[1:05:36](https://youtu.be/v4-FUP5Nefk?t=3936) convincingly yeah i think it would have  
[1:05:38](https://youtu.be/v4-FUP5Nefk?t=3938) to be a camzat beating a kobe and now we  
[1:05:40](https://youtu.be/v4-FUP5Nefk?t=3940) have a new contender they're saying kobe  
[1:05:41](https://youtu.be/v4-FUP5Nefk?t=3941) is going to go up to middleweight now i  
[1:05:42](https://youtu.be/v4-FUP5Nefk?t=3942) think  
[1:05:43](https://youtu.be/v4-FUP5Nefk?t=3943) that's what no he said he's cooled up  
[1:05:46](https://youtu.be/v4-FUP5Nefk?t=3946) yeah  
[1:05:47](https://youtu.be/v4-FUP5Nefk?t=3947) oh uh  
[1:05:49](https://youtu.be/v4-FUP5Nefk?t=3949) maybe he's called him up  
[1:05:51](https://youtu.be/v4-FUP5Nefk?t=3951) you don't think he's because he's got a  
[1:05:52](https://youtu.be/v4-FUP5Nefk?t=3952) grappling pedigree right or do you i  
[1:05:54](https://youtu.be/v4-FUP5Nefk?t=3954) know he's very good look kobe is a real  
[1:05:55](https://youtu.be/v4-FUP5Nefk?t=3955) he's a legit fighter yeah i don't know  
[1:05:57](https://youtu.be/v4-FUP5Nefk?t=3957) if he beats uh  
[1:05:58](https://youtu.be/v4-FUP5Nefk?t=3958) uh  
[1:05:59](https://youtu.be/v4-FUP5Nefk?t=3959) i don't think so because  
[1:06:01](https://youtu.be/v4-FUP5Nefk?t=3961) his fate or weakness was his gravity  
[1:06:03](https://youtu.be/v4-FUP5Nefk?t=3963) yeah sure sure but he's much bigger  
[1:06:05](https://youtu.be/v4-FUP5Nefk?t=3965) longer stronger dangerous at the same  
[1:06:07](https://youtu.be/v4-FUP5Nefk?t=3967) thing  
[1:06:09](https://youtu.be/v4-FUP5Nefk?t=3969) was bigger and stronger that's the  
[1:06:11](https://youtu.be/v4-FUP5Nefk?t=3971) difference yeah blood blochovic was 205  
[1:06:14](https://youtu.be/v4-FUP5Nefk?t=3974) yeah  
[1:06:15](https://youtu.be/v4-FUP5Nefk?t=3975) i think pound for pound at the seniors  
[1:06:16](https://youtu.be/v4-FUP5Nefk?t=3976) better than blojovic yeah but there's a  
[1:06:19](https://youtu.be/v4-FUP5Nefk?t=3979) massive there's a 20 pound weight  
[1:06:20](https://youtu.be/v4-FUP5Nefk?t=3980) difference wait a way in difference not  
[1:06:22](https://youtu.be/v4-FUP5Nefk?t=3982) even a weight difference  
[1:06:23](https://youtu.be/v4-FUP5Nefk?t=3983) blhovich was even bigger than that  
[1:06:25](https://youtu.be/v4-FUP5Nefk?t=3985) that's a massive order so adesanio beats  
[1:06:27](https://youtu.be/v4-FUP5Nefk?t=3987) kovy covington you see bobby covington  
[1:06:31](https://youtu.be/v4-FUP5Nefk?t=3991) what do you think is going to happen  
[1:06:32](https://youtu.be/v4-FUP5Nefk?t=3992) between him and uh hamzat if they go i  
[1:06:34](https://youtu.be/v4-FUP5Nefk?t=3994) think hamzad has his number really yeah  
[1:06:36](https://youtu.be/v4-FUP5Nefk?t=3996) with the grappling and stuff striking  
[1:06:38](https://youtu.be/v4-FUP5Nefk?t=3998) cannot strike him really  
[1:06:40](https://youtu.be/v4-FUP5Nefk?t=4000) i think so possible here's the thing  
[1:06:42](https://youtu.be/v4-FUP5Nefk?t=4002) here here's my i want to say one thing  
[1:06:44](https://youtu.be/v4-FUP5Nefk?t=4004) we haven't seen hamzat in later rounds  
[1:06:46](https://youtu.be/v4-FUP5Nefk?t=4006) sometimes the guy looks so good in round  
[1:06:48](https://youtu.be/v4-FUP5Nefk?t=4008) one and round two he falls apart round  
[1:06:49](https://youtu.be/v4-FUP5Nefk?t=4009) three he falls apart so i don't know  
[1:06:51](https://youtu.be/v4-FUP5Nefk?t=4011) that about him yet i don't know if he  
[1:06:52](https://youtu.be/v4-FUP5Nefk?t=4012) fights hard all the way to the third but  
[1:06:53](https://youtu.be/v4-FUP5Nefk?t=4013) if he can maintain what he does in  
[1:06:55](https://youtu.be/v4-FUP5Nefk?t=4015) rounds one  
[1:06:56](https://youtu.be/v4-FUP5Nefk?t=4016) because all i've seen is round one from  
[1:06:58](https://youtu.be/v4-FUP5Nefk?t=4018) we'll beat everybody him  
[1:06:59](https://youtu.be/v4-FUP5Nefk?t=4019) seen a lot from madison i mean he's good  
[1:07:01](https://youtu.be/v4-FUP5Nefk?t=4021) we know we know what he looks like  
[1:07:02](https://youtu.be/v4-FUP5Nefk?t=4022) around five and he's very durable yeah  
[1:07:04](https://youtu.be/v4-FUP5Nefk?t=4024) he's very durable yeah and uh  
[1:07:07](https://youtu.be/v4-FUP5Nefk?t=4027) mike there's a question mark and comes  
[1:07:09](https://youtu.be/v4-FUP5Nefk?t=4029) that does he have that durability i  
[1:07:10](https://youtu.be/v4-FUP5Nefk?t=4030) think so but we haven't seen it yet  
[1:07:12](https://youtu.be/v4-FUP5Nefk?t=4032) that's why i don't want to jump the gun  
[1:07:13](https://youtu.be/v4-FUP5Nefk?t=4033) and say yes he has it i don't know i  
[1:07:14](https://youtu.be/v4-FUP5Nefk?t=4034) haven't seen that yet but  
[1:07:16](https://youtu.be/v4-FUP5Nefk?t=4036) uh i i really like him against kobe so  
[1:07:18](https://youtu.be/v4-FUP5Nefk?t=4038) do you think he's that he he faces  
[1:07:19](https://youtu.be/v4-FUP5Nefk?t=4039) better chances against um  
[1:07:23](https://youtu.be/v4-FUP5Nefk?t=4043) sanya than he does against  
[1:07:25](https://youtu.be/v4-FUP5Nefk?t=4045) than he does against um  
[1:07:32](https://youtu.be/v4-FUP5Nefk?t=4052) that's tough to call i think uzman's  
[1:07:33](https://youtu.be/v4-FUP5Nefk?t=4053) ultimate challenge for hamzad right yeah  
[1:07:36](https://youtu.be/v4-FUP5Nefk?t=4056) because usman is very mentally tough  
[1:07:37](https://youtu.be/v4-FUP5Nefk?t=4057) also not that arasanya isn't but  
[1:07:39](https://youtu.be/v4-FUP5Nefk?t=4059) it's going to be easier to take down i  
[1:07:40](https://youtu.be/v4-FUP5Nefk?t=4060) think than uh kumaro  
[1:07:43](https://youtu.be/v4-FUP5Nefk?t=4063) that's that's the problem isn't that  
[1:07:44](https://youtu.be/v4-FUP5Nefk?t=4064) because kumar was he's only ever been  
[1:07:45](https://youtu.be/v4-FUP5Nefk?t=4065) taken down once in his career not that  
[1:07:47](https://youtu.be/v4-FUP5Nefk?t=4067) they counted it when kobe took him down  
[1:07:48](https://youtu.be/v4-FUP5Nefk?t=4068) the last fight they didn't statistically  
[1:07:50](https://youtu.be/v4-FUP5Nefk?t=4070) count it but in my opinion it was it was  
[1:07:52](https://youtu.be/v4-FUP5Nefk?t=4072) a takedown who would you have between  
[1:07:54](https://youtu.be/v4-FUP5Nefk?t=4074) usman and george simpion  
[1:07:58](https://youtu.be/v4-FUP5Nefk?t=4078) am i getting in trouble now  
[1:08:00](https://youtu.be/v4-FUP5Nefk?t=4080) listen i love both those guys yeah but  
[1:08:02](https://youtu.be/v4-FUP5Nefk?t=4082) if i have to be totally candid i think  
[1:08:04](https://youtu.be/v4-FUP5Nefk?t=4084) george just has more skills  
[1:08:05](https://youtu.be/v4-FUP5Nefk?t=4085) yeah george has more skills even now  
[1:08:07](https://youtu.be/v4-FUP5Nefk?t=4087) he's more developed yeah even though  
[1:08:08](https://youtu.be/v4-FUP5Nefk?t=4088) like his game goes deeper he has more  
[1:08:10](https://youtu.be/v4-FUP5Nefk?t=4090) layers  
[1:08:12](https://youtu.be/v4-FUP5Nefk?t=4092) and i love usman i really love us man i  
[1:08:13](https://youtu.be/v4-FUP5Nefk?t=4093) i love the guy he's  
[1:08:15](https://youtu.be/v4-FUP5Nefk?t=4095) if you met i don't know if you met him  
[1:08:18](https://youtu.be/v4-FUP5Nefk?t=4098) he's a very sweet humble person kind  
[1:08:20](https://youtu.be/v4-FUP5Nefk?t=4100) salted the earth guy um  
[1:08:24](https://youtu.be/v4-FUP5Nefk?t=4104) this goes beyond you know but i guess  
[1:08:26](https://youtu.be/v4-FUP5Nefk?t=4106) so so yeah but exactly so sure i i hate  
[1:08:28](https://youtu.be/v4-FUP5Nefk?t=4108) to pick one over the other because i  
[1:08:29](https://youtu.be/v4-FUP5Nefk?t=4109) like them both so much but george's game  
[1:08:31](https://youtu.be/v4-FUP5Nefk?t=4111) just goes deeper  
[1:08:32](https://youtu.be/v4-FUP5Nefk?t=4112) yeah he's just he has a greater  
[1:08:34](https://youtu.be/v4-FUP5Nefk?t=4114) understanding of  
[1:08:35](https://youtu.be/v4-FUP5Nefk?t=4115) what about khabib versus uh  
[1:08:38](https://youtu.be/v4-FUP5Nefk?t=4118) pound for a pound  
[1:08:39](https://youtu.be/v4-FUP5Nefk?t=4119) well if they had to catch weight let's  
[1:08:40](https://youtu.be/v4-FUP5Nefk?t=4120) see  
[1:08:43](https://youtu.be/v4-FUP5Nefk?t=4123) people are gonna people are gonna grill  
[1:08:44](https://youtu.be/v4-FUP5Nefk?t=4124) me for this but i'll pick khabib i think  
[1:08:46](https://youtu.be/v4-FUP5Nefk?t=4126) i think that highly of khabib i think  
[1:08:47](https://youtu.be/v4-FUP5Nefk?t=4127) khabib is the ultimate killing machine  
[1:08:49](https://youtu.be/v4-FUP5Nefk?t=4129) he's incredible  
[1:08:51](https://youtu.be/v4-FUP5Nefk?t=4131) so i just feel that khabib has a few  
[1:08:53](https://youtu.be/v4-FUP5Nefk?t=4133) more layers and he's he's just  
[1:08:55](https://youtu.be/v4-FUP5Nefk?t=4135) he's as tough mentally as as usman  
[1:08:58](https://youtu.be/v4-FUP5Nefk?t=4138) and not that i ever want to see them  
[1:08:59](https://youtu.be/v4-FUP5Nefk?t=4139) fight they're close you know they would  
[1:09:01](https://youtu.be/v4-FUP5Nefk?t=4141) never fight each other but i think i  
[1:09:02](https://youtu.be/v4-FUP5Nefk?t=4142) think khabib is like he's a special cut  
[1:09:05](https://youtu.be/v4-FUP5Nefk?t=4145) above  
[1:09:06](https://youtu.be/v4-FUP5Nefk?t=4146) he's very special khabib  
[1:09:09](https://youtu.be/v4-FUP5Nefk?t=4149) i wanted to speak to you more about your  
[1:09:10](https://youtu.be/v4-FUP5Nefk?t=4150) philosophies  
[1:09:13](https://youtu.be/v4-FUP5Nefk?t=4153) but i think what we'll do is we'll do um  
[1:09:16](https://youtu.be/v4-FUP5Nefk?t=4156) when you're when you're back in canada  
[1:09:17](https://youtu.be/v4-FUP5Nefk?t=4157) we'll do an episode just for them  
[1:09:20](https://youtu.be/v4-FUP5Nefk?t=4160) uh because  
[1:09:21](https://youtu.be/v4-FUP5Nefk?t=4161) last time when when i did this  
[1:09:23](https://youtu.be/v4-FUP5Nefk?t=4163) and we said oh we got for us we we made  
[1:09:25](https://youtu.be/v4-FUP5Nefk?t=4165) it the opposite way we kind of spoke  
[1:09:27](https://youtu.be/v4-FUP5Nefk?t=4167) more about the feel philosophical issues  
[1:09:28](https://youtu.be/v4-FUP5Nefk?t=4168) more  
[1:09:29](https://youtu.be/v4-FUP5Nefk?t=4169) and the um  
[1:09:31](https://youtu.be/v4-FUP5Nefk?t=4171) and the the the sports stuff less but  
[1:09:34](https://youtu.be/v4-FUP5Nefk?t=4174) this i think  
[1:09:35](https://youtu.be/v4-FUP5Nefk?t=4175) you know the first time we had a fleshed  
[1:09:37](https://youtu.be/v4-FUP5Nefk?t=4177) out conversation about these things i  
[1:09:39](https://youtu.be/v4-FUP5Nefk?t=4179) think this is very important for the  
[1:09:40](https://youtu.be/v4-FUP5Nefk?t=4180) muslim community but obviously people  
[1:09:42](https://youtu.be/v4-FUP5Nefk?t=4182) don't realize that you have been  
[1:09:44](https://youtu.be/v4-FUP5Nefk?t=4184) really deeply involved i mean one time  
[1:09:47](https://youtu.be/v4-FUP5Nefk?t=4187) maybe you wouldn't mind me saying this  
[1:09:48](https://youtu.be/v4-FUP5Nefk?t=4188) but  
[1:09:49](https://youtu.be/v4-FUP5Nefk?t=4189) in addition to your training you do  
[1:09:51](https://youtu.be/v4-FUP5Nefk?t=4191) hours and hours of studying don't you  
[1:09:53](https://youtu.be/v4-FUP5Nefk?t=4193) like  
[1:09:54](https://youtu.be/v4-FUP5Nefk?t=4194) maybe three four five hours a day or  
[1:09:56](https://youtu.be/v4-FUP5Nefk?t=4196) some how many hours yeah i would say two  
[1:09:58](https://youtu.be/v4-FUP5Nefk?t=4198) to five sometimes wow wow when i travel  
[1:10:01](https://youtu.be/v4-FUP5Nefk?t=4201) you read that much yeah i do what do you  
[1:10:04](https://youtu.be/v4-FUP5Nefk?t=4204) read what do you do  
[1:10:06](https://youtu.be/v4-FUP5Nefk?t=4206) i do a lot of you know what i really  
[1:10:07](https://youtu.be/v4-FUP5Nefk?t=4207) like uh is audible audible.com i use a  
[1:10:10](https://youtu.be/v4-FUP5Nefk?t=4210) lot of their  
[1:10:11](https://youtu.be/v4-FUP5Nefk?t=4211) audiobooks i do a lot of lectures i find  
[1:10:13](https://youtu.be/v4-FUP5Nefk?t=4213) lectures online science history  
[1:10:14](https://youtu.be/v4-FUP5Nefk?t=4214) philosophy  
[1:10:16](https://youtu.be/v4-FUP5Nefk?t=4216) religion i like to listen to debates  
[1:10:18](https://youtu.be/v4-FUP5Nefk?t=4218) lectures i mean absolutely everything on  
[1:10:20](https://youtu.be/v4-FUP5Nefk?t=4220) science history philosophy religion i  
[1:10:22](https://youtu.be/v4-FUP5Nefk?t=4222) listen to all of it i buy all the books  
[1:10:24](https://youtu.be/v4-FUP5Nefk?t=4224) i buy hundreds of books  
[1:10:25](https://youtu.be/v4-FUP5Nefk?t=4225) and for me it's a pleasure just  
[1:10:27](https://youtu.be/v4-FUP5Nefk?t=4227) listening to it as a pleasure like  
[1:10:28](https://youtu.be/v4-FUP5Nefk?t=4228) people listen to music i listen to  
[1:10:29](https://youtu.be/v4-FUP5Nefk?t=4229) audiobooks wow yeah and and as it helped  
[1:10:33](https://youtu.be/v4-FUP5Nefk?t=4233) you gain a sense of spirituality now  
[1:10:34](https://youtu.be/v4-FUP5Nefk?t=4234) we're two weeks away from ramadan  
[1:10:37](https://youtu.be/v4-FUP5Nefk?t=4237) like the the spiritual aspects of islam  
[1:10:40](https://youtu.be/v4-FUP5Nefk?t=4240) you've been reading a lot of ghazali  
[1:10:41](https://youtu.be/v4-FUP5Nefk?t=4241) recently as well haven't you and  
[1:10:44](https://youtu.be/v4-FUP5Nefk?t=4244) what have you what have you kind of  
[1:10:45](https://youtu.be/v4-FUP5Nefk?t=4245) taken from that and  
[1:10:47](https://youtu.be/v4-FUP5Nefk?t=4247) for people that might be listening to  
[1:10:48](https://youtu.be/v4-FUP5Nefk?t=4248) this who might not be aware of the  
[1:10:50](https://youtu.be/v4-FUP5Nefk?t=4250) islamic tradition in particular  
[1:10:51](https://youtu.be/v4-FUP5Nefk?t=4251) what would you guide them to in terms of  
[1:10:54](https://youtu.be/v4-FUP5Nefk?t=4254) reading material  
[1:10:56](https://youtu.be/v4-FUP5Nefk?t=4256) i think gazelle is hard to read honestly  
[1:10:58](https://youtu.be/v4-FUP5Nefk?t=4258) okay i think i think i would if i didn't  
[1:11:01](https://youtu.be/v4-FUP5Nefk?t=4261) study philosophy for so many years  
[1:11:02](https://youtu.be/v4-FUP5Nefk?t=4262) before gazali i wouldn't have understood  
[1:11:04](https://youtu.be/v4-FUP5Nefk?t=4264) anything he meant so i think hazel is  
[1:11:06](https://youtu.be/v4-FUP5Nefk?t=4266) actually quite a difficult read  
[1:11:09](https://youtu.be/v4-FUP5Nefk?t=4269) it's not a good place to start per se if  
[1:11:11](https://youtu.be/v4-FUP5Nefk?t=4271) you don't have a background yeah if you  
[1:11:12](https://youtu.be/v4-FUP5Nefk?t=4272) if you don't have a background then you  
[1:11:13](https://youtu.be/v4-FUP5Nefk?t=4273) start with the quran you know exactly  
[1:11:15](https://youtu.be/v4-FUP5Nefk?t=4275) with the profit  
[1:11:17](https://youtu.be/v4-FUP5Nefk?t=4277) it's a long ways away  
[1:11:19](https://youtu.be/v4-FUP5Nefk?t=4279) um  
[1:11:20](https://youtu.be/v4-FUP5Nefk?t=4280) i don't think i don't think philosophy  
[1:11:22](https://youtu.be/v4-FUP5Nefk?t=4282) is a place where you start yeah i  
[1:11:24](https://youtu.be/v4-FUP5Nefk?t=4284) definitely don't think you start there  
[1:11:25](https://youtu.be/v4-FUP5Nefk?t=4285) uh but you can you can build to that and  
[1:11:28](https://youtu.be/v4-FUP5Nefk?t=4288) um  
[1:11:29](https://youtu.be/v4-FUP5Nefk?t=4289) you know it's it's it's  
[1:11:31](https://youtu.be/v4-FUP5Nefk?t=4291) again you know you start with the quran  
[1:11:32](https://youtu.be/v4-FUP5Nefk?t=4292) the sunnah and then  
[1:11:35](https://youtu.be/v4-FUP5Nefk?t=4295) i'll listen i studied the greeks i  
[1:11:37](https://youtu.be/v4-FUP5Nefk?t=4297) studied muslim philosophers and the  
[1:11:39](https://youtu.be/v4-FUP5Nefk?t=4299) british empiricism and enlightenment  
[1:11:41](https://youtu.be/v4-FUP5Nefk?t=4301) period i think the three together  
[1:11:44](https://youtu.be/v4-FUP5Nefk?t=4304) because i think a lot of them each one  
[1:11:45](https://youtu.be/v4-FUP5Nefk?t=4305) of them was commentary of the on the  
[1:11:47](https://youtu.be/v4-FUP5Nefk?t=4307) past they were influenced by the past  
[1:11:49](https://youtu.be/v4-FUP5Nefk?t=4309) and  
[1:11:50](https://youtu.be/v4-FUP5Nefk?t=4310) logic is an innate thing  
[1:11:53](https://youtu.be/v4-FUP5Nefk?t=4313) so hazel said it beautifully said it  
[1:11:55](https://youtu.be/v4-FUP5Nefk?t=4315) doesn't matter who said it we have to  
[1:11:56](https://youtu.be/v4-FUP5Nefk?t=4316) study each  
[1:11:57](https://youtu.be/v4-FUP5Nefk?t=4317) each claim by itself standing alone and  
[1:12:00](https://youtu.be/v4-FUP5Nefk?t=4320) see whether it's true or not doesn't  
[1:12:01](https://youtu.be/v4-FUP5Nefk?t=4321) matter if aristotle said something or  
[1:12:03](https://youtu.be/v4-FUP5Nefk?t=4323) this guy said something it doesn't  
[1:12:04](https://youtu.be/v4-FUP5Nefk?t=4324) matter we have to verify it for  
[1:12:05](https://youtu.be/v4-FUP5Nefk?t=4325) ourselves we have to have demonstration  
[1:12:08](https://youtu.be/v4-FUP5Nefk?t=4328) and this is this is i think very  
[1:12:09](https://youtu.be/v4-FUP5Nefk?t=4329) important but ultimately speaking  
[1:12:11](https://youtu.be/v4-FUP5Nefk?t=4331) everything boils back down to the fitrah  
[1:12:14](https://youtu.be/v4-FUP5Nefk?t=4334) like you can't go further than that once  
[1:12:15](https://youtu.be/v4-FUP5Nefk?t=4335) you try to go further than that this is  
[1:12:16](https://youtu.be/v4-FUP5Nefk?t=4336) the limit  
[1:12:18](https://youtu.be/v4-FUP5Nefk?t=4338) and  
[1:12:19](https://youtu.be/v4-FUP5Nefk?t=4339) this is what gives certainty hazali's  
[1:12:21](https://youtu.be/v4-FUP5Nefk?t=4341) work is all about getting to certainty  
[1:12:24](https://youtu.be/v4-FUP5Nefk?t=4344) and certainty is a very special thing we  
[1:12:25](https://youtu.be/v4-FUP5Nefk?t=4345) have to differentiate between knowledge  
[1:12:27](https://youtu.be/v4-FUP5Nefk?t=4347) and belief  
[1:12:28](https://youtu.be/v4-FUP5Nefk?t=4348) and certainty is a type of knowledge  
[1:12:30](https://youtu.be/v4-FUP5Nefk?t=4350) that's that's unique  
[1:12:32](https://youtu.be/v4-FUP5Nefk?t=4352) and once you find that nucleus  
[1:12:34](https://youtu.be/v4-FUP5Nefk?t=4354) everything else makes sense everything  
[1:12:35](https://youtu.be/v4-FUP5Nefk?t=4355) makes sense  
[1:12:36](https://youtu.be/v4-FUP5Nefk?t=4356) but you have to get to that nucleus and  
[1:12:38](https://youtu.be/v4-FUP5Nefk?t=4358) that's what he does that's that was his  
[1:12:40](https://youtu.be/v4-FUP5Nefk?t=4360) his uh  
[1:12:42](https://youtu.be/v4-FUP5Nefk?t=4362) crisis as he describes it you know he  
[1:12:44](https://youtu.be/v4-FUP5Nefk?t=4364) went through a crisis because he wanted  
[1:12:45](https://youtu.be/v4-FUP5Nefk?t=4365) to know what's the bedrock of it all  
[1:12:47](https://youtu.be/v4-FUP5Nefk?t=4367) and it's quite a profound thing and  
[1:12:51](https://youtu.be/v4-FUP5Nefk?t=4371) for you reading the quran  
[1:12:54](https://youtu.be/v4-FUP5Nefk?t=4374) and reflecting over and and things like  
[1:12:56](https://youtu.be/v4-FUP5Nefk?t=4376) that what are some of the main things  
[1:12:58](https://youtu.be/v4-FUP5Nefk?t=4378) you have taken away from from that  
[1:13:00](https://youtu.be/v4-FUP5Nefk?t=4380) reading  
[1:13:01](https://youtu.be/v4-FUP5Nefk?t=4381) i think i think the quran  
[1:13:03](https://youtu.be/v4-FUP5Nefk?t=4383) it  
[1:13:04](https://youtu.be/v4-FUP5Nefk?t=4384) it  
[1:13:05](https://youtu.be/v4-FUP5Nefk?t=4385) touches on every type of logic  
[1:13:08](https://youtu.be/v4-FUP5Nefk?t=4388) and it ultimately tells you look  
[1:13:11](https://youtu.be/v4-FUP5Nefk?t=4391) you were born with this special thing  
[1:13:12](https://youtu.be/v4-FUP5Nefk?t=4392) called the fitra this innate belief this  
[1:13:15](https://youtu.be/v4-FUP5Nefk?t=4395) tao had within you  
[1:13:17](https://youtu.be/v4-FUP5Nefk?t=4397) and you have to revert back to that  
[1:13:18](https://youtu.be/v4-FUP5Nefk?t=4398) natural religion  
[1:13:19](https://youtu.be/v4-FUP5Nefk?t=4399) and the quran is reminding you and  
[1:13:21](https://youtu.be/v4-FUP5Nefk?t=4401) telling you about it and  
[1:13:22](https://youtu.be/v4-FUP5Nefk?t=4402) like we were talking about earlier there  
[1:13:24](https://youtu.be/v4-FUP5Nefk?t=4404) are levels of truth there are levels  
[1:13:26](https://youtu.be/v4-FUP5Nefk?t=4406) there  
[1:13:27](https://youtu.be/v4-FUP5Nefk?t=4407) when we talk about what is true that's a  
[1:13:29](https://youtu.be/v4-FUP5Nefk?t=4409) very complicated thing you could put 10  
[1:13:30](https://youtu.be/v4-FUP5Nefk?t=4410) experts in epistemology in one room and  
[1:13:32](https://youtu.be/v4-FUP5Nefk?t=4412) they won't agree on the definition of  
[1:13:34](https://youtu.be/v4-FUP5Nefk?t=4414) truth  
[1:13:35](https://youtu.be/v4-FUP5Nefk?t=4415) so how are you making claims to truth  
[1:13:36](https://youtu.be/v4-FUP5Nefk?t=4416) when we don't even have the definition  
[1:13:37](https://youtu.be/v4-FUP5Nefk?t=4417) of it i think islam ultimately is asking  
[1:13:40](https://youtu.be/v4-FUP5Nefk?t=4420) you to discover  
[1:13:41](https://youtu.be/v4-FUP5Nefk?t=4421) the ultimate truth now  
[1:13:44](https://youtu.be/v4-FUP5Nefk?t=4424) god himself in my opinion the way i  
[1:13:46](https://youtu.be/v4-FUP5Nefk?t=4426) understand it  
[1:13:47](https://youtu.be/v4-FUP5Nefk?t=4427) is actually the only thing that is a  
[1:13:49](https://youtu.be/v4-FUP5Nefk?t=4429) hundred percent objectively true  
[1:13:51](https://youtu.be/v4-FUP5Nefk?t=4431) do you know this is actually a beautiful  
[1:13:53](https://youtu.be/v4-FUP5Nefk?t=4433) um hadith on this there was there's a  
[1:13:55](https://youtu.be/v4-FUP5Nefk?t=4435) poem uh a pre-islamic poet called labit  
[1:13:59](https://youtu.be/v4-FUP5Nefk?t=4439) and  
[1:14:00](https://youtu.be/v4-FUP5Nefk?t=4440) um  
[1:14:01](https://youtu.be/v4-FUP5Nefk?t=4441) he was one of the people actually  
[1:14:03](https://youtu.be/v4-FUP5Nefk?t=4443) because before islam there were there  
[1:14:05](https://youtu.be/v4-FUP5Nefk?t=4445) were poems that were hung up on the um  
[1:14:07](https://youtu.be/v4-FUP5Nefk?t=4447) the kaaba  
[1:14:08](https://youtu.be/v4-FUP5Nefk?t=4448) called them  
[1:14:09](https://youtu.be/v4-FUP5Nefk?t=4449) one of the one of the main people that  
[1:14:11](https://youtu.be/v4-FUP5Nefk?t=4451) wrote was a person called  
[1:14:13](https://youtu.be/v4-FUP5Nefk?t=4453) but he was also a time he was at the  
[1:14:14](https://youtu.be/v4-FUP5Nefk?t=4454) time of the prophet as well and he had a  
[1:14:17](https://youtu.be/v4-FUP5Nefk?t=4457) very um interesting line of poetry which  
[1:14:20](https://youtu.be/v4-FUP5Nefk?t=4460) was  
[1:14:23](https://youtu.be/v4-FUP5Nefk?t=4463) whatever is other than allah is in vain  
[1:14:26](https://youtu.be/v4-FUP5Nefk?t=4466) was not true or is not fully true  
[1:14:28](https://youtu.be/v4-FUP5Nefk?t=4468) and the prophet actually commented on  
[1:14:30](https://youtu.be/v4-FUP5Nefk?t=4470) this line of poetry and he said that  
[1:14:31](https://youtu.be/v4-FUP5Nefk?t=4471) this  
[1:14:32](https://youtu.be/v4-FUP5Nefk?t=4472) is the truest thing a poet has ever said  
[1:14:34](https://youtu.be/v4-FUP5Nefk?t=4474) alhamdulillah which is kind of in line  
[1:14:36](https://youtu.be/v4-FUP5Nefk?t=4476) with what you're saying isn't it  
[1:14:38](https://youtu.be/v4-FUP5Nefk?t=4478) it's  
[1:14:40](https://youtu.be/v4-FUP5Nefk?t=4480) it's something we all know  
[1:14:43](https://youtu.be/v4-FUP5Nefk?t=4483) but  
[1:14:45](https://youtu.be/v4-FUP5Nefk?t=4485) i think ever that's why i say i don't  
[1:14:46](https://youtu.be/v4-FUP5Nefk?t=4486) believe in atheism bring me an atheist  
[1:14:47](https://youtu.be/v4-FUP5Nefk?t=4487) i'm going to find you a deity he  
[1:14:48](https://youtu.be/v4-FUP5Nefk?t=4488) believes it bring me an atheist  
[1:14:51](https://youtu.be/v4-FUP5Nefk?t=4491) they all believe in something  
[1:14:53](https://youtu.be/v4-FUP5Nefk?t=4493) he believes in he believes in a deity  
[1:14:54](https://youtu.be/v4-FUP5Nefk?t=4494) somewhere somehow i'm going to find the  
[1:14:55](https://youtu.be/v4-FUP5Nefk?t=4495) deity in his beliefs i'm going to  
[1:14:57](https://youtu.be/v4-FUP5Nefk?t=4497) cross-examine aluminum and how are you  
[1:14:58](https://youtu.be/v4-FUP5Nefk?t=4498) defining a deity here  
[1:15:01](https://youtu.be/v4-FUP5Nefk?t=4501) something you project from your mind  
[1:15:03](https://youtu.be/v4-FUP5Nefk?t=4503) onto the world  
[1:15:04](https://youtu.be/v4-FUP5Nefk?t=4504) and my definition will go further in  
[1:15:06](https://youtu.be/v4-FUP5Nefk?t=4506) this but just to keep it simple let's  
[1:15:07](https://youtu.be/v4-FUP5Nefk?t=4507) give for  
[1:15:08](https://youtu.be/v4-FUP5Nefk?t=4508) instance nature nature is the most  
[1:15:10](https://youtu.be/v4-FUP5Nefk?t=4510) famous deity in today's age nature what  
[1:15:13](https://youtu.be/v4-FUP5Nefk?t=4513) brought us about nature  
[1:15:14](https://youtu.be/v4-FUP5Nefk?t=4514) nature is just that a word is just sound  
[1:15:16](https://youtu.be/v4-FUP5Nefk?t=4516) you made with your mouth what does it  
[1:15:18](https://youtu.be/v4-FUP5Nefk?t=4518) mean nature  
[1:15:19](https://youtu.be/v4-FUP5Nefk?t=4519) see  
[1:15:20](https://youtu.be/v4-FUP5Nefk?t=4520) nature comes from your observation of  
[1:15:22](https://youtu.be/v4-FUP5Nefk?t=4522) particulars if i asked you what is  
[1:15:24](https://youtu.be/v4-FUP5Nefk?t=4524) nature you would say  
[1:15:25](https://youtu.be/v4-FUP5Nefk?t=4525) well you would have to point to examples  
[1:15:27](https://youtu.be/v4-FUP5Nefk?t=4527) you would say look at that flower  
[1:15:30](https://youtu.be/v4-FUP5Nefk?t=4530) that's nature okay if i destroy all the  
[1:15:32](https://youtu.be/v4-FUP5Nefk?t=4532) flowers nature's gone no no no there's  
[1:15:33](https://youtu.be/v4-FUP5Nefk?t=4533) also  
[1:15:34](https://youtu.be/v4-FUP5Nefk?t=4534) the river  
[1:15:36](https://youtu.be/v4-FUP5Nefk?t=4536) the water cycle the trees  
[1:15:38](https://youtu.be/v4-FUP5Nefk?t=4538) the  
[1:15:39](https://youtu.be/v4-FUP5Nefk?t=4539) the  
[1:15:40](https://youtu.be/v4-FUP5Nefk?t=4540) the bees the ants the cattle  
[1:15:43](https://youtu.be/v4-FUP5Nefk?t=4543) okay what if i destroy all that oh no  
[1:15:45](https://youtu.be/v4-FUP5Nefk?t=4545) there's still more what if i destroy  
[1:15:47](https://youtu.be/v4-FUP5Nefk?t=4547) every particular thing  
[1:15:49](https://youtu.be/v4-FUP5Nefk?t=4549) what if we had a universe an empty  
[1:15:50](https://youtu.be/v4-FUP5Nefk?t=4550) universe would you know nature now you  
[1:15:53](https://youtu.be/v4-FUP5Nefk?t=4553) wouldn't know nature now there's nothing  
[1:15:54](https://youtu.be/v4-FUP5Nefk?t=4554) there's no collective  
[1:15:56](https://youtu.be/v4-FUP5Nefk?t=4556) so  
[1:15:57](https://youtu.be/v4-FUP5Nefk?t=4557) how do you know nature well you saw  
[1:15:58](https://youtu.be/v4-FUP5Nefk?t=4558) blades of grass  
[1:16:01](https://youtu.be/v4-FUP5Nefk?t=4561) you felt the wind  
[1:16:02](https://youtu.be/v4-FUP5Nefk?t=4562) and the word nature is just a collective  
[1:16:04](https://youtu.be/v4-FUP5Nefk?t=4564) to name all those particulars you  
[1:16:05](https://youtu.be/v4-FUP5Nefk?t=4565) experienced  
[1:16:06](https://youtu.be/v4-FUP5Nefk?t=4566) i mean this is exactly what um i think  
[1:16:09](https://youtu.be/v4-FUP5Nefk?t=4569) he believed in that and certainly  
[1:16:10](https://youtu.be/v4-FUP5Nefk?t=4570) nominalism yeah nominalism and and um  
[1:16:15](https://youtu.be/v4-FUP5Nefk?t=4575) was you could say conceptualist as well  
[1:16:16](https://youtu.be/v4-FUP5Nefk?t=4576) like in the sense that he didn't believe  
[1:16:18](https://youtu.be/v4-FUP5Nefk?t=4578) in el culiereto like the gene genuses or  
[1:16:21](https://youtu.be/v4-FUP5Nefk?t=4581) the universals existed  
[1:16:23](https://youtu.be/v4-FUP5Nefk?t=4583) in reality and said you only know them  
[1:16:25](https://youtu.be/v4-FUP5Nefk?t=4585) through the particulars we're projecting  
[1:16:26](https://youtu.be/v4-FUP5Nefk?t=4586) them from our minds this is a name i  
[1:16:28](https://youtu.be/v4-FUP5Nefk?t=4588) give like for instance how many trees  
[1:16:30](https://youtu.be/v4-FUP5Nefk?t=4590) does it take to make a forest well  
[1:16:31](https://youtu.be/v4-FUP5Nefk?t=4591) that's subjective you might have a  
[1:16:32](https://youtu.be/v4-FUP5Nefk?t=4592) different number than me it's a  
[1:16:34](https://youtu.be/v4-FUP5Nefk?t=4594) projection of our mind what do you think  
[1:16:36](https://youtu.be/v4-FUP5Nefk?t=4596) it is it's there's there's subjectivity  
[1:16:37](https://youtu.be/v4-FUP5Nefk?t=4597) is always mingled in what you what you  
[1:16:39](https://youtu.be/v4-FUP5Nefk?t=4599) call truth  
[1:16:41](https://youtu.be/v4-FUP5Nefk?t=4601) except in one instance  
[1:16:42](https://youtu.be/v4-FUP5Nefk?t=4602) so there's part concept part observation  
[1:16:46](https://youtu.be/v4-FUP5Nefk?t=4606) in a quran it says do they not  
[1:16:48](https://youtu.be/v4-FUP5Nefk?t=4608) consider the seed that they sow like  
[1:16:51](https://youtu.be/v4-FUP5Nefk?t=4611) your  
[1:16:52](https://youtu.be/v4-FUP5Nefk?t=4612) nature is coming after your observation  
[1:16:54](https://youtu.be/v4-FUP5Nefk?t=4614) so i observed  
[1:16:56](https://youtu.be/v4-FUP5Nefk?t=4616) particulars  
[1:16:57](https://youtu.be/v4-FUP5Nefk?t=4617) then i came up with the idea of nature  
[1:16:59](https://youtu.be/v4-FUP5Nefk?t=4619) without the particulars that universal  
[1:17:01](https://youtu.be/v4-FUP5Nefk?t=4621) doesn't exist  
[1:17:03](https://youtu.be/v4-FUP5Nefk?t=4623) the universal is dependent on  
[1:17:05](https://youtu.be/v4-FUP5Nefk?t=4625) particulars  
[1:17:06](https://youtu.be/v4-FUP5Nefk?t=4626) allah is telling you look i don't depend  
[1:17:08](https://youtu.be/v4-FUP5Nefk?t=4628) on particulars  
[1:17:09](https://youtu.be/v4-FUP5Nefk?t=4629) i am the particular this is the quranic  
[1:17:11](https://youtu.be/v4-FUP5Nefk?t=4631) point of view  
[1:17:12](https://youtu.be/v4-FUP5Nefk?t=4632) so one example i've  
[1:17:14](https://youtu.be/v4-FUP5Nefk?t=4634) come up with recently is to help make  
[1:17:16](https://youtu.be/v4-FUP5Nefk?t=4636) this even clearer is remember the ship  
[1:17:18](https://youtu.be/v4-FUP5Nefk?t=4638) of thesis yeah okay so let's think about  
[1:17:20](https://youtu.be/v4-FUP5Nefk?t=4640) the ship of thesis okay i'm gonna i'm  
[1:17:22](https://youtu.be/v4-FUP5Nefk?t=4642) gonna go through it again real quick  
[1:17:23](https://youtu.be/v4-FUP5Nefk?t=4643) because i know we've done it before yeah  
[1:17:24](https://youtu.be/v4-FUP5Nefk?t=4644) the ship of thesis is a ship of 99 parts  
[1:17:27](https://youtu.be/v4-FUP5Nefk?t=4647) it belongs to a man named thesis every  
[1:17:29](https://youtu.be/v4-FUP5Nefk?t=4649) day he changes changes apart  
[1:17:32](https://youtu.be/v4-FUP5Nefk?t=4652) after 99 days his ship has been  
[1:17:34](https://youtu.be/v4-FUP5Nefk?t=4654) completely re  
[1:17:35](https://youtu.be/v4-FUP5Nefk?t=4655) every pace has been changed 99 days 99  
[1:17:38](https://youtu.be/v4-FUP5Nefk?t=4658) parts  
[1:17:39](https://youtu.be/v4-FUP5Nefk?t=4659) those old parts we put them in a  
[1:17:40](https://youtu.be/v4-FUP5Nefk?t=4660) warehouse somewhere he's sailing that  
[1:17:42](https://youtu.be/v4-FUP5Nefk?t=4662) ship we all identified as the ship of  
[1:17:44](https://youtu.be/v4-FUP5Nefk?t=4664) thesis  
[1:17:46](https://youtu.be/v4-FUP5Nefk?t=4666) then one day i go in the warehouse i put  
[1:17:47](https://youtu.be/v4-FUP5Nefk?t=4667) this the old pieces back together now  
[1:17:49](https://youtu.be/v4-FUP5Nefk?t=4669) there are two ships on the ocean we both  
[1:17:51](https://youtu.be/v4-FUP5Nefk?t=4671) call them both the ship of theseus and  
[1:17:52](https://youtu.be/v4-FUP5Nefk?t=4672) if i ask you which one is the ship of  
[1:17:53](https://youtu.be/v4-FUP5Nefk?t=4673) pieces  
[1:17:54](https://youtu.be/v4-FUP5Nefk?t=4674) well now it has a lot to do with your  
[1:17:56](https://youtu.be/v4-FUP5Nefk?t=4676) subjective uh sense of what identity is  
[1:17:59](https://youtu.be/v4-FUP5Nefk?t=4679) there's no objective way to  
[1:18:00](https://youtu.be/v4-FUP5Nefk?t=4680) differentiate which one is the ship of  
[1:18:02](https://youtu.be/v4-FUP5Nefk?t=4682) thesis  
[1:18:03](https://youtu.be/v4-FUP5Nefk?t=4683) now imagine these two ships are i'm  
[1:18:05](https://youtu.be/v4-FUP5Nefk?t=4685) gonna make the problem even worse  
[1:18:06](https://youtu.be/v4-FUP5Nefk?t=4686) imagine these two ships are going around  
[1:18:08](https://youtu.be/v4-FUP5Nefk?t=4688) on the ocean  
[1:18:10](https://youtu.be/v4-FUP5Nefk?t=4690) and every day each ship is still  
[1:18:11](https://youtu.be/v4-FUP5Nefk?t=4691) changing a new piece  
[1:18:14](https://youtu.be/v4-FUP5Nefk?t=4694) and the old pieces i'm taking from both  
[1:18:15](https://youtu.be/v4-FUP5Nefk?t=4695) ships and i'm creating a third ship  
[1:18:19](https://youtu.be/v4-FUP5Nefk?t=4699) and the ships are changing piece every  
[1:18:20](https://youtu.be/v4-FUP5Nefk?t=4700) day and  
[1:18:21](https://youtu.be/v4-FUP5Nefk?t=4701) they're they're their particulars are  
[1:18:23](https://youtu.be/v4-FUP5Nefk?t=4703) being mingled shuffled like a card of  
[1:18:25](https://youtu.be/v4-FUP5Nefk?t=4705) deck of cards and i'm making thousands  
[1:18:26](https://youtu.be/v4-FUP5Nefk?t=4706) and thousands of ships now ask you which  
[1:18:28](https://youtu.be/v4-FUP5Nefk?t=4708) one is the ship of thesis you're like  
[1:18:29](https://youtu.be/v4-FUP5Nefk?t=4709) hey well you know it all depends on how  
[1:18:30](https://youtu.be/v4-FUP5Nefk?t=4710) you see it  
[1:18:33](https://youtu.be/v4-FUP5Nefk?t=4713) the ship of thesis is an archetype  
[1:18:36](https://youtu.be/v4-FUP5Nefk?t=4716) there's an archetype in your mind and  
[1:18:37](https://youtu.be/v4-FUP5Nefk?t=4717) you use that archetype this is what  
[1:18:39](https://youtu.be/v4-FUP5Nefk?t=4719) plato called the forms to identify  
[1:18:40](https://youtu.be/v4-FUP5Nefk?t=4720) what's out there  
[1:18:43](https://youtu.be/v4-FUP5Nefk?t=4723) but now i want you to  
[1:18:45](https://youtu.be/v4-FUP5Nefk?t=4725) put this example to the side think about  
[1:18:47](https://youtu.be/v4-FUP5Nefk?t=4727) a ship now if i told you about a ship  
[1:18:49](https://youtu.be/v4-FUP5Nefk?t=4729) it's the divine ship  
[1:18:51](https://youtu.be/v4-FUP5Nefk?t=4731) this ship is not trans it doesn't  
[1:18:53](https://youtu.be/v4-FUP5Nefk?t=4733) transition it doesn't change it always  
[1:18:54](https://youtu.be/v4-FUP5Nefk?t=4734) was will always be and there will never  
[1:18:56](https://youtu.be/v4-FUP5Nefk?t=4736) be another ship  
[1:18:57](https://youtu.be/v4-FUP5Nefk?t=4737) you no longer need this archetype  
[1:18:59](https://youtu.be/v4-FUP5Nefk?t=4739) there's no more form of ship  
[1:19:02](https://youtu.be/v4-FUP5Nefk?t=4742) you had an archetype because that thing  
[1:19:03](https://youtu.be/v4-FUP5Nefk?t=4743) the original example i gave  
[1:19:05](https://youtu.be/v4-FUP5Nefk?t=4745) the ship of thesis that goes through a  
[1:19:07](https://youtu.be/v4-FUP5Nefk?t=4747) change like me and you our bodies after  
[1:19:09](https://youtu.be/v4-FUP5Nefk?t=4749) seven years of life your entire all your  
[1:19:11](https://youtu.be/v4-FUP5Nefk?t=4751) cells have been changed in your body  
[1:19:14](https://youtu.be/v4-FUP5Nefk?t=4754) we are like the ship of theseus we are  
[1:19:16](https://youtu.be/v4-FUP5Nefk?t=4756) part archetype we are part observation  
[1:19:18](https://youtu.be/v4-FUP5Nefk?t=4758) we are part object  
[1:19:22](https://youtu.be/v4-FUP5Nefk?t=4762) but imagine a ship that was divine  
[1:19:24](https://youtu.be/v4-FUP5Nefk?t=4764) never changes and never will change and  
[1:19:26](https://youtu.be/v4-FUP5Nefk?t=4766) always was  
[1:19:28](https://youtu.be/v4-FUP5Nefk?t=4768) if i told you if i asked you something  
[1:19:30](https://youtu.be/v4-FUP5Nefk?t=4770) about that ship if i told you where's  
[1:19:31](https://youtu.be/v4-FUP5Nefk?t=4771) the ship of these you say that's the  
[1:19:33](https://youtu.be/v4-FUP5Nefk?t=4773) ship of theseus now there's no more  
[1:19:35](https://youtu.be/v4-FUP5Nefk?t=4775) archetype there's no more subjectivity  
[1:19:38](https://youtu.be/v4-FUP5Nefk?t=4778) there's no more your opinion is  
[1:19:39](https://youtu.be/v4-FUP5Nefk?t=4779) different than mine and we're equally  
[1:19:41](https://youtu.be/v4-FUP5Nefk?t=4781) true we're not equal footing no more now  
[1:19:42](https://youtu.be/v4-FUP5Nefk?t=4782) there are facts now it's truly objective  
[1:19:44](https://youtu.be/v4-FUP5Nefk?t=4784) in the original  
[1:19:46](https://youtu.be/v4-FUP5Nefk?t=4786) example i gave you it was subjective the  
[1:19:48](https://youtu.be/v4-FUP5Nefk?t=4788) truth was subjective there was part  
[1:19:50](https://youtu.be/v4-FUP5Nefk?t=4790) object  
[1:19:52](https://youtu.be/v4-FUP5Nefk?t=4792) part archetype so there was room for  
[1:19:54](https://youtu.be/v4-FUP5Nefk?t=4794) subjectivity now there is no more room  
[1:19:56](https://youtu.be/v4-FUP5Nefk?t=4796) for when there is only one  
[1:19:59](https://youtu.be/v4-FUP5Nefk?t=4799) see like if you give me a  
[1:20:01](https://youtu.be/v4-FUP5Nefk?t=4801) a pagan god there's an archetype to  
[1:20:03](https://youtu.be/v4-FUP5Nefk?t=4803) their gods  
[1:20:05](https://youtu.be/v4-FUP5Nefk?t=4805) this is what i refer to oftentimes as  
[1:20:06](https://youtu.be/v4-FUP5Nefk?t=4806) the abrahamic experience you have to  
[1:20:08](https://youtu.be/v4-FUP5Nefk?t=4808) strike down  
[1:20:09](https://youtu.be/v4-FUP5Nefk?t=4809) all  
[1:20:11](https://youtu.be/v4-FUP5Nefk?t=4811) the multiplicities because to get to  
[1:20:14](https://youtu.be/v4-FUP5Nefk?t=4814) objectivity pure objectivity which is  
[1:20:16](https://youtu.be/v4-FUP5Nefk?t=4816) what ghazali was looking for when allah  
[1:20:18](https://youtu.be/v4-FUP5Nefk?t=4818) tells you i am one he's telling you look  
[1:20:19](https://youtu.be/v4-FUP5Nefk?t=4819) i am literal i am the particular  
[1:20:23](https://youtu.be/v4-FUP5Nefk?t=4823) you all are particulars and universals  
[1:20:25](https://youtu.be/v4-FUP5Nefk?t=4825) you are not like me  
[1:20:28](https://youtu.be/v4-FUP5Nefk?t=4828) is one category there will never be any  
[1:20:31](https://youtu.be/v4-FUP5Nefk?t=4831) category like this  
[1:20:33](https://youtu.be/v4-FUP5Nefk?t=4833) this is what the quran is telling allah  
[1:20:35](https://youtu.be/v4-FUP5Nefk?t=4835) like  
[1:20:36](https://youtu.be/v4-FUP5Nefk?t=4836) you have to understand when  
[1:20:37](https://youtu.be/v4-FUP5Nefk?t=4837) when i teach you language when you learn  
[1:20:39](https://youtu.be/v4-FUP5Nefk?t=4839) language every word is dependent on  
[1:20:41](https://youtu.be/v4-FUP5Nefk?t=4841) another word  
[1:20:43](https://youtu.be/v4-FUP5Nefk?t=4843) if i want to explain you what table  
[1:20:44](https://youtu.be/v4-FUP5Nefk?t=4844) means i have to explain to you the words  
[1:20:46](https://youtu.be/v4-FUP5Nefk?t=4846) i have to use words and those words that  
[1:20:47](https://youtu.be/v4-FUP5Nefk?t=4847) i use to explain the word table also are  
[1:20:49](https://youtu.be/v4-FUP5Nefk?t=4849) contingent on other words  
[1:20:52](https://youtu.be/v4-FUP5Nefk?t=4852) how can i explain to you table if  
[1:20:53](https://youtu.be/v4-FUP5Nefk?t=4853) there's an infinite regress of  
[1:20:54](https://youtu.be/v4-FUP5Nefk?t=4854) contingent words well i have to give you  
[1:20:56](https://youtu.be/v4-FUP5Nefk?t=4856) experience i have to tell you look this  
[1:20:57](https://youtu.be/v4-FUP5Nefk?t=4857) is a table  
[1:20:59](https://youtu.be/v4-FUP5Nefk?t=4859) now you have direct experience with the  
[1:21:01](https://youtu.be/v4-FUP5Nefk?t=4861) table  
[1:21:02](https://youtu.be/v4-FUP5Nefk?t=4862) the word table goes with it if you  
[1:21:03](https://youtu.be/v4-FUP5Nefk?t=4863) didn't see a table i could never use  
[1:21:06](https://youtu.be/v4-FUP5Nefk?t=4866) words to explain to you what table is i  
[1:21:08](https://youtu.be/v4-FUP5Nefk?t=4868) have to i have to  
[1:21:09](https://youtu.be/v4-FUP5Nefk?t=4869) tie it with some experience you have  
[1:21:12](https://youtu.be/v4-FUP5Nefk?t=4872) this is very important because when i  
[1:21:13](https://youtu.be/v4-FUP5Nefk?t=4873) tell you about allah you don't tell me  
[1:21:14](https://youtu.be/v4-FUP5Nefk?t=4874) what does that mean i never heard of  
[1:21:15](https://youtu.be/v4-FUP5Nefk?t=4875) this no you know exactly but i never  
[1:21:18](https://youtu.be/v4-FUP5Nefk?t=4878) pointed i never pointed here this is  
[1:21:20](https://youtu.be/v4-FUP5Nefk?t=4880) allah  
[1:21:22](https://youtu.be/v4-FUP5Nefk?t=4882) you know allah so i say there's no  
[1:21:23](https://youtu.be/v4-FUP5Nefk?t=4883) atheist  
[1:21:24](https://youtu.be/v4-FUP5Nefk?t=4884) because i've never spoke to a person who  
[1:21:26](https://youtu.be/v4-FUP5Nefk?t=4886) said look i don't even understand what  
[1:21:27](https://youtu.be/v4-FUP5Nefk?t=4887) you're talking about  
[1:21:29](https://youtu.be/v4-FUP5Nefk?t=4889) because if i'm  
[1:21:30](https://youtu.be/v4-FUP5Nefk?t=4890) you cannot truly make up something all  
[1:21:32](https://youtu.be/v4-FUP5Nefk?t=4892) you could do is take things that exist  
[1:21:34](https://youtu.be/v4-FUP5Nefk?t=4894) and make a collage  
[1:21:37](https://youtu.be/v4-FUP5Nefk?t=4897) so if people tell me look i believe in  
[1:21:38](https://youtu.be/v4-FUP5Nefk?t=4898) the god of war i might say no you took  
[1:21:40](https://youtu.be/v4-FUP5Nefk?t=4900) god and you took war and you mingled  
[1:21:42](https://youtu.be/v4-FUP5Nefk?t=4902) them together  
[1:21:44](https://youtu.be/v4-FUP5Nefk?t=4904) but  
[1:21:45](https://youtu.be/v4-FUP5Nefk?t=4905) like a blind man can never know the  
[1:21:47](https://youtu.be/v4-FUP5Nefk?t=4907) color red  
[1:21:48](https://youtu.be/v4-FUP5Nefk?t=4908) unless you fix his eyes and he sees red  
[1:21:51](https://youtu.be/v4-FUP5Nefk?t=4911) like that when i talk to you about allah  
[1:21:52](https://youtu.be/v4-FUP5Nefk?t=4912) you know exactly what i'm talking about  
[1:21:54](https://youtu.be/v4-FUP5Nefk?t=4914) wow  
[1:21:56](https://youtu.be/v4-FUP5Nefk?t=4916) so i i came up with another thought  
[1:21:57](https://youtu.be/v4-FUP5Nefk?t=4917) experiment to try to teach this to to  
[1:21:59](https://youtu.be/v4-FUP5Nefk?t=4919) make it more simple mm-hmm what gazelle  
[1:22:01](https://youtu.be/v4-FUP5Nefk?t=4921) is trying to say  
[1:22:03](https://youtu.be/v4-FUP5Nefk?t=4923) we've all you've heard about the beetle  
[1:22:04](https://youtu.be/v4-FUP5Nefk?t=4924) in the box so for instance this is to  
[1:22:06](https://youtu.be/v4-FUP5Nefk?t=4926) point to the heart problem of  
[1:22:07](https://youtu.be/v4-FUP5Nefk?t=4927) consciousness imagine i have a insider i  
[1:22:09](https://youtu.be/v4-FUP5Nefk?t=4929) have a box and inside this box i open  
[1:22:10](https://youtu.be/v4-FUP5Nefk?t=4930) the box inside there's a beetle  
[1:22:13](https://youtu.be/v4-FUP5Nefk?t=4933) you you have your own box you open your  
[1:22:14](https://youtu.be/v4-FUP5Nefk?t=4934) box you see a beetle  
[1:22:16](https://youtu.be/v4-FUP5Nefk?t=4936) but there's no beetles in existence we  
[1:22:17](https://youtu.be/v4-FUP5Nefk?t=4937) don't see them when we observe the world  
[1:22:19](https://youtu.be/v4-FUP5Nefk?t=4939) around us we all see books we see  
[1:22:20](https://youtu.be/v4-FUP5Nefk?t=4940) microphones we see cars but we don't see  
[1:22:21](https://youtu.be/v4-FUP5Nefk?t=4941) any beetles but when i look at my box i  
[1:22:24](https://youtu.be/v4-FUP5Nefk?t=4944) tell you i try to explain to you what  
[1:22:25](https://youtu.be/v4-FUP5Nefk?t=4945) i'm seeing and you try to explain to me  
[1:22:26](https://youtu.be/v4-FUP5Nefk?t=4946) what you're seeing or like hey we both  
[1:22:27](https://youtu.be/v4-FUP5Nefk?t=4947) have one  
[1:22:29](https://youtu.be/v4-FUP5Nefk?t=4949) we both have a beetle in the box  
[1:22:31](https://youtu.be/v4-FUP5Nefk?t=4951) every person we meet they all have a  
[1:22:32](https://youtu.be/v4-FUP5Nefk?t=4952) beetle in the box but we can't look in  
[1:22:34](https://youtu.be/v4-FUP5Nefk?t=4954) each other's box this is what's known in  
[1:22:36](https://youtu.be/v4-FUP5Nefk?t=4956) philosophy as the ego centric  
[1:22:37](https://youtu.be/v4-FUP5Nefk?t=4957) predicament you're trapped within your  
[1:22:38](https://youtu.be/v4-FUP5Nefk?t=4958) own body  
[1:22:42](https://youtu.be/v4-FUP5Nefk?t=4962) if i tell you hey guys my beetle has a  
[1:22:45](https://youtu.be/v4-FUP5Nefk?t=4965) blonde hair  
[1:22:48](https://youtu.be/v4-FUP5Nefk?t=4968) you're like wait a second no blonde hair  
[1:22:49](https://youtu.be/v4-FUP5Nefk?t=4969) is that's dunya  
[1:22:51](https://youtu.be/v4-FUP5Nefk?t=4971) you're taking the beetle and you're  
[1:22:52](https://youtu.be/v4-FUP5Nefk?t=4972) mixing it with what you saw in the world  
[1:22:54](https://youtu.be/v4-FUP5Nefk?t=4974) the beetle in the box is not we're not  
[1:22:56](https://youtu.be/v4-FUP5Nefk?t=4976) seeing it in the dunya we're seeing it  
[1:22:57](https://youtu.be/v4-FUP5Nefk?t=4977) internally we're having direct  
[1:22:58](https://youtu.be/v4-FUP5Nefk?t=4978) experience with the beetle in the box  
[1:23:02](https://youtu.be/v4-FUP5Nefk?t=4982) any if i tell you hey my my beetle is  
[1:23:04](https://youtu.be/v4-FUP5Nefk?t=4984) wearing boxing gloves you can be like no  
[1:23:05](https://youtu.be/v4-FUP5Nefk?t=4985) no that part's not true  
[1:23:07](https://youtu.be/v4-FUP5Nefk?t=4987) that part's not true because that's not  
[1:23:08](https://youtu.be/v4-FUP5Nefk?t=4988) what i'm seeing when i'm looking you're  
[1:23:09](https://youtu.be/v4-FUP5Nefk?t=4989) taking dunya and you're mixing it in  
[1:23:11](https://youtu.be/v4-FUP5Nefk?t=4991) with the beetle in the box so every  
[1:23:14](https://youtu.be/v4-FUP5Nefk?t=4994) every human being is born with this  
[1:23:15](https://youtu.be/v4-FUP5Nefk?t=4995) fitra this belief in one god  
[1:23:18](https://youtu.be/v4-FUP5Nefk?t=4998) you're incubated in it  
[1:23:20](https://youtu.be/v4-FUP5Nefk?t=5000) then when you're born you find things  
[1:23:22](https://youtu.be/v4-FUP5Nefk?t=5002) that  
[1:23:23](https://youtu.be/v4-FUP5Nefk?t=5003) you want to associate with it you want  
[1:23:24](https://youtu.be/v4-FUP5Nefk?t=5004) to mingle with it  
[1:23:25](https://youtu.be/v4-FUP5Nefk?t=5005) and then therefore you have polygamy  
[1:23:28](https://youtu.be/v4-FUP5Nefk?t=5008) that's another you know another  
[1:23:31](https://youtu.be/v4-FUP5Nefk?t=5011) sorry did i say polygamy yeah freudian  
[1:23:34](https://youtu.be/v4-FUP5Nefk?t=5014) slip you said  
[1:23:38](https://youtu.be/v4-FUP5Nefk?t=5018) yeah well i meant um  
[1:23:41](https://youtu.be/v4-FUP5Nefk?t=5021) uh  
[1:23:42](https://youtu.be/v4-FUP5Nefk?t=5022) assimilation no no no multiple gods and  
[1:23:44](https://youtu.be/v4-FUP5Nefk?t=5024) integration no no no monopolism  
[1:23:49](https://youtu.be/v4-FUP5Nefk?t=5029) we're both thinking polygamy  
[1:23:50](https://youtu.be/v4-FUP5Nefk?t=5030) [Laughter]  
[1:23:52](https://youtu.be/v4-FUP5Nefk?t=5032) sorry my fault yeah that's fine edit  
[1:23:54](https://youtu.be/v4-FUP5Nefk?t=5034) that part for my wife please  
[1:23:56](https://youtu.be/v4-FUP5Nefk?t=5036) it's okay don't worry yeah um yep uh not  
[1:24:00](https://youtu.be/v4-FUP5Nefk?t=5040) polygamy  
[1:24:02](https://youtu.be/v4-FUP5Nefk?t=5042) polytheism  
[1:24:05](https://youtu.be/v4-FUP5Nefk?t=5045) so that's where where polytheism comes  
[1:24:07](https://youtu.be/v4-FUP5Nefk?t=5047) from yeah i always tell people you learn  
[1:24:09](https://youtu.be/v4-FUP5Nefk?t=5049) the number one first  
[1:24:10](https://youtu.be/v4-FUP5Nefk?t=5050) then you learn two you can't learn the  
[1:24:12](https://youtu.be/v4-FUP5Nefk?t=5052) number two  
[1:24:14](https://youtu.be/v4-FUP5Nefk?t=5054) two is one and one  
[1:24:16](https://youtu.be/v4-FUP5Nefk?t=5056) you cannot explain the number ten  
[1:24:17](https://youtu.be/v4-FUP5Nefk?t=5057) without referring to the number one  
[1:24:20](https://youtu.be/v4-FUP5Nefk?t=5060) every other  
[1:24:22](https://youtu.be/v4-FUP5Nefk?t=5062) supposed deity  
[1:24:25](https://youtu.be/v4-FUP5Nefk?t=5065) is a mingling of the number one  
[1:24:27](https://youtu.be/v4-FUP5Nefk?t=5067) so like all words  
[1:24:30](https://youtu.be/v4-FUP5Nefk?t=5070) rely on experience experiences  
[1:24:33](https://youtu.be/v4-FUP5Nefk?t=5073) when we say the word god it also relies  
[1:24:35](https://youtu.be/v4-FUP5Nefk?t=5075) on experience  
[1:24:37](https://youtu.be/v4-FUP5Nefk?t=5077) there's not a word you know that doesn't  
[1:24:39](https://youtu.be/v4-FUP5Nefk?t=5079) rely on experience that's very deep it's  
[1:24:40](https://youtu.be/v4-FUP5Nefk?t=5080) very important it's amazing that's why  
[1:24:42](https://youtu.be/v4-FUP5Nefk?t=5082) there is no there is no atheist on the  
[1:24:44](https://youtu.be/v4-FUP5Nefk?t=5084) face of the earth
