According to the schools of thought in Islamic jurisprudence, three out of four schools say that after 120 days, a woman can abort. One school of thought says that after 40 days. She then says, "It's inconceivable to think that after 120 days, a Muslim can believe in something referred to as 'late stage terminal abortion.'"  goes on to ask, "Should we move on to the next one because I think here we're assuming the best?"

<a onclick="modifyYTiframeseektime('40')">0:00:40</a> [Laughter]  
<a onclick="modifyYTiframeseektime('42')">0:00:42</a> today we're going to be reacting to a  
<a onclick="modifyYTiframeseektime('44')">0:00:44</a> video which i came across which has many  
<a onclick="modifyYTiframeseektime('45')">0:00:45</a> many views uh about seven million  
<a onclick="modifyYTiframeseektime('48')">0:00:48</a> actually i was surprised i didn't come  
<a onclick="modifyYTiframeseektime('49')">0:00:49</a> across this video or that no one sent it  
<a onclick="modifyYTiframeseektime('51')">0:00:51</a> to me before i think we were all  
<a onclick="modifyYTiframeseektime('52')">0:00:52</a> surprised actually because this video  
<a onclick="modifyYTiframeseektime('53')">0:00:53</a> was quite interesting it is actually  
<a onclick="modifyYTiframeseektime('54')">0:00:54</a> yeah not least because there was  
<a onclick="modifyYTiframeseektime('56')">0:00:56</a> actually a muslim representative  
<a onclick="modifyYTiframeseektime('59')">0:00:59</a> did she represent  
<a onclick="modifyYTiframeseektime('60')">0:01:00</a> exactly this is the question right there  
<a onclick="modifyYTiframeseektime('62')">0:01:02</a> was a muslim woman there who at least  
<a onclick="modifyYTiframeseektime('64')">0:01:04</a> looked like a muslim but did not sound  
<a onclick="modifyYTiframeseektime('66')">0:01:06</a> like one  
<a onclick="modifyYTiframeseektime('67')">0:01:07</a> who was answering these questions and  
<a onclick="modifyYTiframeseektime('69')">0:01:09</a> the way this this program works the  
<a onclick="modifyYTiframeseektime('70')">0:01:10</a> spectrum is that they've asked these  
<a onclick="modifyYTiframeseektime('72')">0:01:12</a> questions and then they would stand  
<a onclick="modifyYTiframeseektime('74')">0:01:14</a> on a spectrum  
<a onclick="modifyYTiframeseektime('75')">0:01:15</a> okay on whether they agree  
<a onclick="modifyYTiframeseektime('78')">0:01:18</a> or to what extent they agree and or  
<a onclick="modifyYTiframeseektime('79')">0:01:19</a> disagree  
<a onclick="modifyYTiframeseektime('80')">0:01:20</a> and so there are there are a few  
<a onclick="modifyYTiframeseektime('82')">0:01:22</a> questions here that were asked i think  
<a onclick="modifyYTiframeseektime('83')">0:01:23</a> which are person into the public  
<a onclick="modifyYTiframeseektime('84')">0:01:24</a> discourse which we want to react to so  
<a onclick="modifyYTiframeseektime('87')">0:01:27</a> let's let's look at the first thing  
<a onclick="modifyYTiframeseektime('89')">0:01:29</a> that i i felt was um  
<a onclick="modifyYTiframeseektime('92')">0:01:32</a> pretty important  
<a onclick="modifyYTiframeseektime('95')">0:01:35</a> i actually don't want kids but if i were  
<a onclick="modifyYTiframeseektime('97')">0:01:37</a> to decide to do that i would want them  
<a onclick="modifyYTiframeseektime('100')">0:01:40</a> to to grow up in that environment where  
<a onclick="modifyYTiframeseektime('102')">0:01:42</a> there's no difference between you two  
<a onclick="modifyYTiframeseektime('104')">0:01:44</a> you don't have like a curfew that she  
<a onclick="modifyYTiframeseektime('106')">0:01:46</a> doesn't have or vice versa so hijab what  
<a onclick="modifyYTiframeseektime('109')">0:01:49</a> do you think about that because that's  
<a onclick="modifyYTiframeseektime('109')">0:01:49</a> something a bit you know i would say  
<a onclick="modifyYTiframeseektime('111')">0:01:51</a> well close to all of our hearts but you  
<a onclick="modifyYTiframeseektime('113')">0:01:53</a> know to see a muslim woman um saying  
<a onclick="modifyYTiframeseektime('115')">0:01:55</a> what she said or moving to where she  
<a onclick="modifyYTiframeseektime('117')">0:01:57</a> moved was it the right move  
<a onclick="modifyYTiframeseektime('118')">0:01:58</a> no i don't i don't think it was the  
<a onclick="modifyYTiframeseektime('120')">0:02:00</a> right move but um we can employ hosni  
<a onclick="modifyYTiframeseektime('122')">0:02:02</a> van here or the  
<a onclick="modifyYTiframeseektime('123')">0:02:03</a> thinking good because at this point in  
<a onclick="modifyYTiframeseektime('125')">0:02:05</a> time you can see that generically i mean  
<a onclick="modifyYTiframeseektime('128')">0:02:08</a> when you're raising boys and girls there  
<a onclick="modifyYTiframeseektime('129')">0:02:09</a> are not that many differences in the way  
<a onclick="modifyYTiframeseektime('131')">0:02:11</a> that you're going to raise both of them  
<a onclick="modifyYTiframeseektime('132')">0:02:12</a> in fact there are many rules in islam  
<a onclick="modifyYTiframeseektime('134')">0:02:14</a> which indicate that you should be equal  
<a onclick="modifyYTiframeseektime('136')">0:02:16</a> in gifts  
<a onclick="modifyYTiframeseektime('137')">0:02:17</a> and time spent and your love that you  
<a onclick="modifyYTiframeseektime('139')">0:02:19</a> have for both boys and girls so  
<a onclick="modifyYTiframeseektime('141')">0:02:21</a> generically i mean  
<a onclick="modifyYTiframeseektime('142')">0:02:22</a> uh i don't think it's wrong however  
<a onclick="modifyYTiframeseektime('144')">0:02:24</a> there are obviously differences  
<a onclick="modifyYTiframeseektime('146')">0:02:26</a> especially as boys and girls become  
<a onclick="modifyYTiframeseektime('148')">0:02:28</a> closer to puberty  
<a onclick="modifyYTiframeseektime('149')">0:02:29</a> and become closer to adulthood so  
<a onclick="modifyYTiframeseektime('152')">0:02:32</a> that's what i would say like for for  
<a onclick="modifyYTiframeseektime('153')">0:02:33</a> instance  
<a onclick="modifyYTiframeseektime('155')">0:02:35</a> a boy now who's becoming a man has to  
<a onclick="modifyYTiframeseektime('158')">0:02:38</a> start thinking about protection the  
<a onclick="modifyYTiframeseektime('159')">0:02:39</a> protective role that they would have  
<a onclick="modifyYTiframeseektime('162')">0:02:42</a> this is something we believe in we  
<a onclick="modifyYTiframeseektime('163')">0:02:43</a> believe that for example a boy a son and  
<a onclick="modifyYTiframeseektime('165')">0:02:45</a> a daughter  
<a onclick="modifyYTiframeseektime('166')">0:02:46</a> knowing that the son has advantages  
<a onclick="modifyYTiframeseektime('169')">0:02:49</a> which are anatomical in nature  
<a onclick="modifyYTiframeseektime('171')">0:02:51</a> clearly you would you would guide the  
<a onclick="modifyYTiframeseektime('172')">0:02:52</a> sun to be protective of over the  
<a onclick="modifyYTiframeseektime('174')">0:02:54</a> daughter in a way that you wouldn't tell  
<a onclick="modifyYTiframeseektime('176')">0:02:56</a> the daughter to be protective over the  
<a onclick="modifyYTiframeseektime('178')">0:02:58</a> sun i don't know how to accent do you  
<a onclick="modifyYTiframeseektime('180')">0:03:00</a> agree with uh with that no exactly even  
<a onclick="modifyYTiframeseektime('182')">0:03:02</a> biologically that follows you know i've  
<a onclick="modifyYTiframeseektime('184')">0:03:04</a> had a discussion with feminists in the  
<a onclick="modifyYTiframeseektime('185')">0:03:05</a> park as well you know it's it's it's sad  
<a onclick="modifyYTiframeseektime('187')">0:03:07</a> you know for them to deny their own  
<a onclick="modifyYTiframeseektime('188')">0:03:08</a> biology you know and we're not talking  
<a onclick="modifyYTiframeseektime('190')">0:03:10</a> about exceptions they'll come and say oh  
<a onclick="modifyYTiframeseektime('191')">0:03:11</a> but if there's a woman that's a  
<a onclick="modifyYTiframeseektime('192')">0:03:12</a> kickboxer we're not talking about that  
<a onclick="modifyYTiframeseektime('193')">0:03:13</a> you know it's it's the duty of the male  
<a onclick="modifyYTiframeseektime('196')">0:03:16</a> and like allah says men are the  
<a onclick="modifyYTiframeseektime('197')">0:03:17</a> maintainers and practices of women  
<a onclick="modifyYTiframeseektime('198')">0:03:18</a> period if the one who created me said  
<a onclick="modifyYTiframeseektime('200')">0:03:20</a> that there's there's nothing else that  
<a onclick="modifyYTiframeseektime('201')">0:03:21</a> needs to be loved that's what i was  
<a onclick="modifyYTiframeseektime('203')">0:03:23</a> saying without delving in too much  
<a onclick="modifyYTiframeseektime('206')">0:03:26</a> yeah i was gonna say that if if i was to  
<a onclick="modifyYTiframeseektime('209')">0:03:29</a> push back and play devil's advocate i  
<a onclick="modifyYTiframeseektime('212')">0:03:32</a> would say okay but here we're talking  
<a onclick="modifyYTiframeseektime('214')">0:03:34</a> about kids  
<a onclick="modifyYTiframeseektime('215')">0:03:35</a> should you not be bringing them all up  
<a onclick="modifyYTiframeseektime('217')">0:03:37</a> as protectors should they not all be  
<a onclick="modifyYTiframeseektime('220')">0:03:40</a> exposed to that no what's the definition  
<a onclick="modifyYTiframeseektime('221')">0:03:41</a> protected  
<a onclick="modifyYTiframeseektime('222')">0:03:42</a> look firstly if i have a daughter and  
<a onclick="modifyYTiframeseektime('224')">0:03:44</a> have a son i'll both tell them both how  
<a onclick="modifyYTiframeseektime('227')">0:03:47</a> to protect myself and i'm sure even your  
<a onclick="modifyYTiframeseektime('229')">0:03:49</a> could you send them to bjj you know so  
<a onclick="modifyYTiframeseektime('232')">0:03:52</a> even though you're  
<a onclick="modifyYTiframeseektime('233')">0:03:53</a> against this but in your life you  
<a onclick="modifyYTiframeseektime('235')">0:03:55</a> practice like you take your daughter and  
<a onclick="modifyYTiframeseektime('237')">0:03:57</a> your son to bjj however let's be real  
<a onclick="modifyYTiframeseektime('239')">0:03:59</a> here that when they grow up yeah that we  
<a onclick="modifyYTiframeseektime('241')">0:04:01</a> need to be real with them and tell them  
<a onclick="modifyYTiframeseektime('243')">0:04:03</a> you know and i'm sure they would realize  
<a onclick="modifyYTiframeseektime('244')">0:04:04</a> that with their own biology they'll  
<a onclick="modifyYTiframeseektime('245')">0:04:05</a> understand that a man is tend to be more  
<a onclick="modifyYTiframeseektime('247')">0:04:07</a> stronger and their brother is there to  
<a onclick="modifyYTiframeseektime('248')">0:04:08</a> protect you  
<a onclick="modifyYTiframeseektime('249')">0:04:09</a> why should we be afraid of that that's  
<a onclick="modifyYTiframeseektime('251')">0:04:11</a> why i would say that and you know on  
<a onclick="modifyYTiframeseektime('252')">0:04:12</a> this point you know i take my child to i  
<a onclick="modifyYTiframeseektime('255')">0:04:15</a> would do we do everything with like in  
<a onclick="modifyYTiframeseektime('257')">0:04:17</a> terms of self defense my two i've got  
<a onclick="modifyYTiframeseektime('258')">0:04:18</a> two daughters as you know but the thing  
<a onclick="modifyYTiframeseektime('261')">0:04:21</a> is  
<a onclick="modifyYTiframeseektime('262')">0:04:22</a> i do that now when she's very young and  
<a onclick="modifyYTiframeseektime('264')">0:04:24</a> prepubescent and the same thing with my  
<a onclick="modifyYTiframeseektime('266')">0:04:26</a> son but the moment puberty kicks in i  
<a onclick="modifyYTiframeseektime('268')">0:04:28</a> mean people don't realize the effect of  
<a onclick="modifyYTiframeseektime('269')">0:04:29</a> testosterone when testosterone comes  
<a onclick="modifyYTiframeseektime('272')">0:04:32</a> into the picture i mean it's changing it  
<a onclick="modifyYTiframeseektime('275')">0:04:35</a> actually increases muscle mass by up to  
<a onclick="modifyYTiframeseektime('277')">0:04:37</a> fifty percent  
<a onclick="modifyYTiframeseektime('279')">0:04:39</a> fifty five zero percent  
<a onclick="modifyYTiframeseektime('281')">0:04:41</a> so now you know this is very interesting  
<a onclick="modifyYTiframeseektime('285')">0:04:45</a> you see children right when they grow  
<a onclick="modifyYTiframeseektime('287')">0:04:47</a> older and you see how like for example  
<a onclick="modifyYTiframeseektime('289')">0:04:49</a> girls versus boys before the pubescent  
<a onclick="modifyYTiframeseektime('291')">0:04:51</a> stage girls can sometimes really  
<a onclick="modifyYTiframeseektime('293')">0:04:53</a> dominate boys because they don't there's  
<a onclick="modifyYTiframeseektime('295')">0:04:55</a> no like testosterone advantage and these  
<a onclick="modifyYTiframeseektime('298')">0:04:58</a> kind of things you see that very it's  
<a onclick="modifyYTiframeseektime('299')">0:04:59</a> very often um very common but then when  
<a onclick="modifyYTiframeseektime('302')">0:05:02</a> when pbe hits that's no longer a  
<a onclick="modifyYTiframeseektime('303')">0:05:03</a> question i remember i remember going to  
<a onclick="modifyYTiframeseektime('305')">0:05:05</a> a boxing club when i was younger i want  
<a onclick="modifyYTiframeseektime('306')">0:05:06</a> to mention the club but one of the top  
<a onclick="modifyYTiframeseektime('308')">0:05:08</a> female boxers in the uk actually who  
<a onclick="modifyYTiframeseektime('310')">0:05:10</a> represented gb in  
<a onclick="modifyYTiframeseektime('312')">0:05:12</a> the olympics okay  
<a onclick="modifyYTiframeseektime('314')">0:05:14</a> when i think the first year they had  
<a onclick="modifyYTiframeseektime('316')">0:05:16</a> female boxing yeah  
<a onclick="modifyYTiframeseektime('318')">0:05:18</a> she was basically sparring she was a  
<a onclick="modifyYTiframeseektime('320')">0:05:20</a> woman she was part of the 14 year old  
<a onclick="modifyYTiframeseektime('321')">0:05:21</a> boys  
<a onclick="modifyYTiframeseektime('323')">0:05:23</a> 13 14 year olds yeah eights and your  
<a onclick="modifyYTiframeseektime('324')">0:05:24</a> nines she would be inconceivable to put  
<a onclick="modifyYTiframeseektime('327')">0:05:27</a> her in with you know a 21 year old or  
<a onclick="modifyYTiframeseektime('330')">0:05:30</a> something like that  
<a onclick="modifyYTiframeseektime('332')">0:05:32</a> who's her weight or equal weight because  
<a onclick="modifyYTiframeseektime('334')">0:05:34</a> the advantages are so well described  
<a onclick="modifyYTiframeseektime('336')">0:05:36</a> then everyone knows in in that industry  
<a onclick="modifyYTiframeseektime('338')">0:05:38</a> that it would be so disadvantageous for  
<a onclick="modifyYTiframeseektime('339')">0:05:39</a> them okay should we move on to the next  
<a onclick="modifyYTiframeseektime('341')">0:05:41</a> one because i think here we're assuming

<a onclick="modifyYTiframeseektime('353')">0:05:53</a> oh here we go hi guys  
<a onclick="modifyYTiframeseektime('358')">0:05:58</a> second that i agree with that statement  
<a onclick="modifyYTiframeseektime('360')">0:06:00</a> but i feel like the heavy restrictions  
<a onclick="modifyYTiframeseektime('363')">0:06:03</a> that are placed on it by our government  
<a onclick="modifyYTiframeseektime('365')">0:06:05</a> just dictating what we can do with our  
<a onclick="modifyYTiframeseektime('366')">0:06:06</a> bodies is really infuriating and then  
<a onclick="modifyYTiframeseektime('368')">0:06:08</a> seeing people who have kids and resent  
<a onclick="modifyYTiframeseektime('370')">0:06:10</a> it for the rest of their lives and  
<a onclick="modifyYTiframeseektime('372')">0:06:12</a> raising children that they never wanted  
<a onclick="modifyYTiframeseektime('374')">0:06:14</a> it's frustrating and so do you think  
<a onclick="modifyYTiframeseektime('376')">0:06:16</a> that those parents that are struggling  
<a onclick="modifyYTiframeseektime('378')">0:06:18</a> with raising their children that they  
<a onclick="modifyYTiframeseektime('379')">0:06:19</a> didn't have the option for adoption or  
<a onclick="modifyYTiframeseektime('382')">0:06:22</a> other ways it depends like for a lot of  
<a onclick="modifyYTiframeseektime('385')">0:06:25</a> cultures adoption is not okay so as you  
<a onclick="modifyYTiframeseektime('387')">0:06:27</a> guys saw she was strongly agreeing with  
<a onclick="modifyYTiframeseektime('390')">0:06:30</a> abortion but we know this just to make  
<a onclick="modifyYTiframeseektime('391')">0:06:31</a> this clear  
<a onclick="modifyYTiframeseektime('392')">0:06:32</a> that according to the the schools of  
<a onclick="modifyYTiframeseektime('394')">0:06:34</a> thought in islamic jurisprudence three  
<a onclick="modifyYTiframeseektime('396')">0:06:36</a> out of four schools say  
<a onclick="modifyYTiframeseektime('398')">0:06:38</a> that after 120 days i mean up to 120  
<a onclick="modifyYTiframeseektime('401')">0:06:41</a> days you can abort  
<a onclick="modifyYTiframeseektime('403')">0:06:43</a> in certain circumstances not not all  
<a onclick="modifyYTiframeseektime('405')">0:06:45</a> circumstances and one school of thought  
<a onclick="modifyYTiframeseektime('407')">0:06:47</a> says 40 days  
<a onclick="modifyYTiframeseektime('408')">0:06:48</a> it's inconceivable to think that after  
<a onclick="modifyYTiframeseektime('411')">0:06:51</a> 120 days that a muslim  
<a onclick="modifyYTiframeseektime('414')">0:06:54</a> can believe in something referred to as  
<a onclick="modifyYTiframeseektime('416')">0:06:56</a> late stage terminal abortion  
<a onclick="modifyYTiframeseektime('419')">0:06:59</a> which is as you know in in america in

<a onclick="modifyYTiframeseektime('423')">0:07:03</a> different parts of the world can go up  
<a onclick="modifyYTiframeseektime('425')">0:07:05</a> to six months which if you've ever seen  
<a onclick="modifyYTiframeseektime('427')">0:07:07</a> a child a child can survive in six  
<a onclick="modifyYTiframeseektime('429')">0:07:09</a> months the way they take and we couldn't  
<a onclick="modifyYTiframeseektime('431')">0:07:11</a> even put this like as a picture of you  
<a onclick="modifyYTiframeseektime('433')">0:07:13</a> know a video how they actually extract  
<a onclick="modifyYTiframeseektime('436')">0:07:16</a> and cut up a baby that's five months old  
<a onclick="modifyYTiframeseektime('438')">0:07:18</a> literally a viable child a viable when i

<a onclick="modifyYTiframeseektime('443')">0:07:23</a> has a pulse it has a heart it has organs  
<a onclick="modifyYTiframeseektime('445')">0:07:25</a> it has a brain it can

<a onclick="modifyYTiframeseektime('448')">0:07:28</a> it has a nervous system you killed this  
<a onclick="modifyYTiframeseektime('451')">0:07:31</a> child practically  
<a onclick="modifyYTiframeseektime('453')">0:07:33</a> you're saying that a woman should have  
<a onclick="modifyYTiframeseektime('454')">0:07:34</a> the right to do this  
<a onclick="modifyYTiframeseektime('456')">0:07:36</a> on what grounds do you think this is  
<a onclick="modifyYTiframeseektime('457')">0:07:37</a> commensurate with the islamic teaching  
<a onclick="modifyYTiframeseektime('459')">0:07:39</a> to be honest i believe this it's it's  
<a onclick="modifyYTiframeseektime('460')">0:07:40</a> just based on nothing no rationale no  
<a onclick="modifyYTiframeseektime('462')">0:07:42</a> logic it's just basically  
<a onclick="modifyYTiframeseektime('464')">0:07:44</a> i see an insecure muslim woman yeah  
<a onclick="modifyYTiframeseektime('467')">0:07:47</a> who's dominated uh yes you know with  
<a onclick="modifyYTiframeseektime('469')">0:07:49</a> ideologically yeah in the west yes and  
<a onclick="modifyYTiframeseektime('471')">0:07:51</a> she's just basically  
<a onclick="modifyYTiframeseektime('473')">0:07:53</a> like she's just saying you know i'm here  
<a onclick="modifyYTiframeseektime('474')">0:07:54</a> do wherever you like me and wherever you  
<a onclick="modifyYTiframeseektime('476')">0:07:56</a> go i'm to follow you that's what i see  
<a onclick="modifyYTiframeseektime('478')">0:07:58</a> because there is no way if i sat that  
<a onclick="modifyYTiframeseektime('479')">0:07:59</a> sister down i said do you genuinely  
<a onclick="modifyYTiframeseektime('481')">0:08:01</a> believe this she would say to me  
<a onclick="modifyYTiframeseektime('483')">0:08:03</a> i hope she would say to me no like i  
<a onclick="modifyYTiframeseektime('484')">0:08:04</a> don't even know if i can say that she  
<a onclick="modifyYTiframeseektime('486')">0:08:06</a> will say no and i hope she will say no  
<a onclick="modifyYTiframeseektime('488')">0:08:08</a> but the thing is here how could you can  
<a onclick="modifyYTiframeseektime('489')">0:08:09</a> you imagine this sister she's going to  
<a onclick="modifyYTiframeseektime('491')">0:08:11</a> watch this i don't know if you have kids

<a onclick="modifyYTiframeseektime('500')">0:08:20</a> your sibling  
<a onclick="modifyYTiframeseektime('502')">0:08:22</a> imagine bro

<a onclick="modifyYTiframeseektime('506')">0:08:26</a> piece because we need to put this into  
<a onclick="modifyYTiframeseektime('508')">0:08:28</a> perspective when you come in and say oh  
<a onclick="modifyYTiframeseektime('509')">0:08:29</a> that's wrong no no look at your child  
<a onclick="modifyYTiframeseektime('511')">0:08:31</a> and say and if you did ever do abortion  
<a onclick="modifyYTiframeseektime('513')">0:08:33</a> may allah forgive you and repent look at  
<a onclick="modifyYTiframeseektime('515')">0:08:35</a> your child and say one of your siblings  
<a onclick="modifyYTiframeseektime('517')">0:08:37</a> that died

<a onclick="modifyYTiframeseektime('522')">0:08:42</a> limb by limb and we ripped them into  
<a onclick="modifyYTiframeseektime('524')">0:08:44</a> pieces  
<a onclick="modifyYTiframeseektime('526')">0:08:46</a> you're not talking about early abortion  
<a onclick="modifyYTiframeseektime('527')">0:08:47</a> yeah  
<a onclick="modifyYTiframeseektime('528')">0:08:48</a> no we're talking about five months yes  
<a onclick="modifyYTiframeseektime('530')">0:08:50</a> but she's she's saying totally agree  
<a onclick="modifyYTiframeseektime('531')">0:08:51</a> about her and the question is very clear  
<a onclick="modifyYTiframeseektime('533')">0:08:53</a> so yes so  
<a onclick="modifyYTiframeseektime('535')">0:08:55</a> limb by limb you've literally killed  
<a onclick="modifyYTiframeseektime('537')">0:08:57</a> your own child you've killed your own  
<a onclick="modifyYTiframeseektime('538')">0:08:58</a> child so you should  
<a onclick="modifyYTiframeseektime('540')">0:09:00</a> bring up the child and say this is what  
<a onclick="modifyYTiframeseektime('542')">0:09:02</a> i did to your sibling would you do that  
<a onclick="modifyYTiframeseektime('547')">0:09:07</a> the quran states that when the child  
<a onclick="modifyYTiframeseektime('549')">0:09:09</a> that the female interestingly  
<a onclick="modifyYTiframeseektime('551')">0:09:11</a> female infanticide that the quran is  
<a onclick="modifyYTiframeseektime('553')">0:09:13</a> against when the female child  
<a onclick="modifyYTiframeseektime('555')">0:09:15</a> says for what for what sin did i what  
<a onclick="modifyYTiframeseektime('558')">0:09:18</a> did you kill me for yes yes  
<a onclick="modifyYTiframeseektime('562')">0:09:22</a> [Music]  
<a onclick="modifyYTiframeseektime('564')">0:09:24</a> what did you kill me for feminism  
<a onclick="modifyYTiframeseektime('565')">0:09:25</a> exactly no no no no no what did you kill  
<a onclick="modifyYTiframeseektime('566')">0:09:26</a> me can you watch under the judgement  
<a onclick="modifyYTiframeseektime('568')">0:09:28</a> what did you kill me for uh for uh an  
<a onclick="modifyYTiframeseektime('570')">0:09:30</a> ideology because i was insecure  
<a onclick="modifyYTiframeseektime('574')">0:09:34</a> i think what's interesting here is the  
<a onclick="modifyYTiframeseektime('576')">0:09:36</a> the slogan they use is my body my choice  
<a onclick="modifyYTiframeseektime('579')">0:09:39</a> but absolutely your body it's not your  
<a onclick="modifyYTiframeseektime('580')">0:09:40</a> body  
<a onclick="modifyYTiframeseektime('582')">0:09:42</a> it's my body one bro one brother made a  
<a onclick="modifyYTiframeseektime('584')">0:09:44</a> very good choice  
<a onclick="modifyYTiframeseektime('585')">0:09:45</a> not choice he made a very good point and  
<a onclick="modifyYTiframeseektime('587')">0:09:47</a> he said  
<a onclick="modifyYTiframeseektime('588')">0:09:48</a> that puts the whole kind of impetus on  
<a onclick="modifyYTiframeseektime('590')">0:09:50</a> the past person themselves but they're  
<a onclick="modifyYTiframeseektime('592')">0:09:52</a> not the only one that's responsible or  
<a onclick="modifyYTiframeseektime('595')">0:09:55</a> affected by that decision exactly that's  
<a onclick="modifyYTiframeseektime('596')">0:09:56</a> right what about the choice of the  
<a onclick="modifyYTiframeseektime('598')">0:09:58</a> father what about the choice of the  
<a onclick="modifyYTiframeseektime('600')">0:10:00</a> grandfather about the choice of the  
<a onclick="modifyYTiframeseektime('601')">0:10:01</a> family these sorts of things it's like  
<a onclick="modifyYTiframeseektime('603')">0:10:03</a> you mentioned about human rights it's  
<a onclick="modifyYTiframeseektime('605')">0:10:05</a> all about  
<a onclick="modifyYTiframeseektime('606')">0:10:06</a> what you owed and not what you owe and  
<a onclick="modifyYTiframeseektime('609')">0:10:09</a> that's one of the issues that we have  
<a onclick="modifyYTiframeseektime('610')">0:10:10</a> with this that's point number one point  
<a onclick="modifyYTiframeseektime('611')">0:10:11</a> number two even  
<a onclick="modifyYTiframeseektime('613')">0:10:13</a> ronaldo himself he was one of the  
<a onclick="modifyYTiframeseektime('615')">0:10:15</a> children and he mentions this in his  
<a onclick="modifyYTiframeseektime('618')">0:10:18</a> documentary that he was supposed to be  
<a onclick="modifyYTiframeseektime('619')">0:10:19</a> aborted he was supposed to be gone but  
<a onclick="modifyYTiframeseektime('622')">0:10:22</a> if we didn't have ronaldo then we  
<a onclick="modifyYTiframeseektime('624')">0:10:24</a> wouldn't have such a a  
<a onclick="modifyYTiframeseektime('627')">0:10:27</a> a football star that people look up to  
<a onclick="modifyYTiframeseektime('629')">0:10:29</a> because he doesn't have tattoos he  
<a onclick="modifyYTiframeseektime('631')">0:10:31</a> doesn't drink alcohol you know he looks  
<a onclick="modifyYTiframeseektime('634')">0:10:34</a> after his family and and somebody that  
<a onclick="modifyYTiframeseektime('636')">0:10:36</a> is i'm not saying the best of role  
<a onclick="modifyYTiframeseektime('637')">0:10:37</a> models but i'm saying he's better than  
<a onclick="modifyYTiframeseektime('639')">0:10:39</a> most  
<a onclick="modifyYTiframeseektime('640')">0:10:40</a> so these two things i think uh  
<a onclick="modifyYTiframeseektime('643')">0:10:43</a> are very important things to reflect  
<a onclick="modifyYTiframeseektime('645')">0:10:45</a> about but you you wanted to say  
<a onclick="modifyYTiframeseektime('646')">0:10:46</a> something about my body and my choice i  
<a onclick="modifyYTiframeseektime('648')">0:10:48</a> forget this is my body my choice no so  
<a onclick="modifyYTiframeseektime('650')">0:10:50</a> we we are created by allah and we belong  
<a onclick="modifyYTiframeseektime('652')">0:10:52</a> to allah simple as that yeah this again  
<a onclick="modifyYTiframeseektime('653')">0:10:53</a> it's it's a matter of akida bro and  
<a onclick="modifyYTiframeseektime('655')">0:10:55</a> having tawakon and allah because when  
<a onclick="modifyYTiframeseektime('657')">0:10:57</a> you're aborting this child again it's a  
<a onclick="modifyYTiframeseektime('659')">0:10:59</a> lack of  
<a onclick="modifyYTiframeseektime('660')">0:11:00</a> because if your thinking is i can't look  
<a onclick="modifyYTiframeseektime('662')">0:11:02</a> after them okay allah says in the quran  
<a onclick="modifyYTiframeseektime('664')">0:11:04</a> he is the one that provides one life all  
<a onclick="modifyYTiframeseektime('666')">0:11:06</a> these issues linked to tawheed and his  
<a onclick="modifyYTiframeseektime('669')">0:11:09</a> mainly  
<a onclick="modifyYTiframeseektime('670')">0:11:10</a> not trusting having trust in allah  
<a onclick="modifyYTiframeseektime('673')">0:11:13</a> knowing that he's the creator that  
<a onclick="modifyYTiframeseektime('674')">0:11:14</a> created the heavens and the earth that  
<a onclick="modifyYTiframeseektime('675')">0:11:15</a> he can provide for you it's not deep  
<a onclick="modifyYTiframeseektime('677')">0:11:17</a> well  
<a onclick="modifyYTiframeseektime('678')">0:11:18</a> it's an insulin can you imagine the one  
<a onclick="modifyYTiframeseektime('679')">0:11:19</a> who created the heavens do you believe  
<a onclick="modifyYTiframeseektime('680')">0:11:20</a> in him yeah i do but do you believe it  
<a onclick="modifyYTiframeseektime('682')">0:11:22</a> can provide for you uh what an insult  
<a onclick="modifyYTiframeseektime('684')">0:11:24</a> what's an insult there's there's also  
<a onclick="modifyYTiframeseektime('686')">0:11:26</a> another thing that needs to be  
<a onclick="modifyYTiframeseektime('688')">0:11:28</a> understood here they might say you know  
<a onclick="modifyYTiframeseektime('689')">0:11:29</a> what she's just um she's just a woman  
<a onclick="modifyYTiframeseektime('691')">0:11:31</a> you know leave her alone  
<a onclick="modifyYTiframeseektime('695')">0:11:35</a> the thing is there's two types of  
<a onclick="modifyYTiframeseektime('697')">0:11:37</a> muslims that can go on a show like that  
<a onclick="modifyYTiframeseektime('698')">0:11:38</a> one without hijab that people will  
<a onclick="modifyYTiframeseektime('700')">0:11:40</a> assume certain things let's face it we  
<a onclick="modifyYTiframeseektime('702')">0:11:42</a> do live in a society where we judge by  
<a onclick="modifyYTiframeseektime('705')">0:11:45</a> what's apparent whether it's right right  
<a onclick="modifyYTiframeseektime('707')">0:11:47</a> or whether it's wrong if somebody sees a  
<a onclick="modifyYTiframeseektime('709')">0:11:49</a> hijabi woman on there and they're not  
<a onclick="modifyYTiframeseektime('711')">0:11:51</a> that exposed to islam they will assume  
<a onclick="modifyYTiframeseektime('713')">0:11:53</a> that that is the orthodox opinion of  
<a onclick="modifyYTiframeseektime('716')">0:11:56</a> islam so you're saying that there is a  
<a onclick="modifyYTiframeseektime('718')">0:11:58</a> cut of age and you're saying three  
<a onclick="modifyYTiframeseektime('719')">0:11:59</a> months now you could argue maybe she  
<a onclick="modifyYTiframeseektime('721')">0:12:01</a> knew that maybe she didn't know that  
<a onclick="modifyYTiframeseektime('723')">0:12:03</a> four months but with all due respect  
<a onclick="modifyYTiframeseektime('725')">0:12:05</a> like if she didn't know that and she  
<a onclick="modifyYTiframeseektime('726')">0:12:06</a> knows she's the only hijabi on that show  
<a onclick="modifyYTiframeseektime('728')">0:12:08</a> it's a big channel she has a  
<a onclick="modifyYTiframeseektime('730')">0:12:10</a> responsibility to say and represent her  
<a onclick="modifyYTiframeseektime('733')">0:12:13</a> religion because she's wearing the  
<a onclick="modifyYTiframeseektime('734')">0:12:14</a> attire if you're wearing the attire of a  
<a onclick="modifyYTiframeseektime('736')">0:12:16</a> policewoman and then somebody asks you  
<a onclick="modifyYTiframeseektime('738')">0:12:18</a> law and you get the law wrong you can't  
<a onclick="modifyYTiframeseektime('740')">0:12:20</a> say hey don't judge me by the way i look  
<a onclick="modifyYTiframeseektime('742')">0:12:22</a> so she's she is responsible and she does  
<a onclick="modifyYTiframeseektime('745')">0:12:25</a> need to be sensible about these things  
<a onclick="modifyYTiframeseektime('747')">0:12:27</a> even if you make the argument that maybe  
<a onclick="modifyYTiframeseektime('749')">0:12:29</a> it was cut out maybe this may be that  
<a onclick="modifyYTiframeseektime('750')">0:12:30</a> she should you know ensure that her  
<a onclick="modifyYTiframeseektime('752')">0:12:32</a> religion is represented well i think  
<a onclick="modifyYTiframeseektime('755')">0:12:35</a> with her the thing is what is most  
<a onclick="modifyYTiframeseektime('757')">0:12:37</a> despicable  
<a onclick="modifyYTiframeseektime('758')">0:12:38</a> about her  
<a onclick="modifyYTiframeseektime('760')">0:12:40</a> kind of  
<a onclick="modifyYTiframeseektime('761')">0:12:41</a> portrayal of islam or lack thereof  
<a onclick="modifyYTiframeseektime('763')">0:12:43</a> actually to be honest with you is the  
<a onclick="modifyYTiframeseektime('765')">0:12:45</a> fact that she's being so inconsistent  
<a onclick="modifyYTiframeseektime('767')">0:12:47</a> with her worldview  
<a onclick="modifyYTiframeseektime('769')">0:12:49</a> look she's representing islam through  
<a onclick="modifyYTiframeseektime('771')">0:12:51</a> her attire like you've mentioned  
<a onclick="modifyYTiframeseektime('773')">0:12:53</a> and she's meant to represent a muslim  
<a onclick="modifyYTiframeseektime('775')">0:12:55</a> voice on the show yeah she all she's  
<a onclick="modifyYTiframeseektime('778')">0:12:58</a> doing is spouting left-wing propaganda  
<a onclick="modifyYTiframeseektime('781')">0:13:01</a> second word feminism  
<a onclick="modifyYTiframeseektime('782')">0:13:02</a> this is not a representation of what  
<a onclick="modifyYTiframeseektime('784')">0:13:04</a> muslims believe and she's not  
<a onclick="modifyYTiframeseektime('786')">0:13:06</a> self-consistent with islam she's trying  
<a onclick="modifyYTiframeseektime('788')">0:13:08</a> to bring two opposing ideologies  
<a onclick="modifyYTiframeseektime('790')">0:13:10</a> together second wave feminism and islam  
<a onclick="modifyYTiframeseektime('793')">0:13:13</a> and it's just looking wrong first of all  
<a onclick="modifyYTiframeseektime('795')">0:13:15</a> i want to i want to show one thing okay  
<a onclick="modifyYTiframeseektime('797')">0:13:17</a> they asked a question which is  
<a onclick="modifyYTiframeseektime('799')">0:13:19</a> that do they believe that the world  
<a onclick="modifyYTiframeseektime('801')">0:13:21</a> would be a better place if it's run by  
<a onclick="modifyYTiframeseektime('802')">0:13:22</a> women yeah  
<a onclick="modifyYTiframeseektime('803')">0:13:23</a> and look where she stands on the on  
<a onclick="modifyYTiframeseektime('805')">0:13:25</a> there she doesn't have a strong stance  
<a onclick="modifyYTiframeseektime('807')">0:13:27</a> but look where she stands as well but  
<a onclick="modifyYTiframeseektime('809')">0:13:29</a> then look at the contribution i want to  
<a onclick="modifyYTiframeseektime('811')">0:13:31</a> focus on the contribution of the white  
<a onclick="modifyYTiframeseektime('813')">0:13:33</a> feminists white feminists because i  
<a onclick="modifyYTiframeseektime('815')">0:13:35</a> actually think it was a very good  
<a onclick="modifyYTiframeseektime('817')">0:13:37</a> contribution from within her own  
<a onclick="modifyYTiframeseektime('818')">0:13:38</a> paradigm  
<a onclick="modifyYTiframeseektime('820')">0:13:40</a> how is that any different than saying i  
<a onclick="modifyYTiframeseektime('821')">0:13:41</a> believe that the world would be better  
<a onclick="modifyYTiframeseektime('823')">0:13:43</a> if it were run by men like if we're  
<a onclick="modifyYTiframeseektime('825')">0:13:45</a> going to say that on this token we get  
<a onclick="modifyYTiframeseektime('826')">0:13:46</a> that on that token that's not even  
<a onclick="modifyYTiframeseektime('828')">0:13:48</a> balanced at all now if you compare that  
<a onclick="modifyYTiframeseektime('830')">0:13:50</a> with the muslims contribution okay  
<a onclick="modifyYTiframeseektime('833')">0:13:53</a> let's see what the muslim has to say and  
<a onclick="modifyYTiframeseektime('834')">0:13:54</a> then and then comment on all of it  
<a onclick="modifyYTiframeseektime('836')">0:13:56</a> that's why i chose this one too because  
<a onclick="modifyYTiframeseektime('838')">0:13:58</a> i don't think it should be one or the  
<a onclick="modifyYTiframeseektime('839')">0:13:59</a> other i definitely think that  
<a onclick="modifyYTiframeseektime('841')">0:14:01</a> when it's only man run they're missing  
<a onclick="modifyYTiframeseektime('843')">0:14:03</a> the rest of society you can't really  
<a onclick="modifyYTiframeseektime('845')">0:14:05</a> operate the world or any government or  
<a onclick="modifyYTiframeseektime('847')">0:14:07</a> leadership if you're not embracing the  
<a onclick="modifyYTiframeseektime('849')">0:14:09</a> second half of society so  
<a onclick="modifyYTiframeseektime('851')">0:14:11</a> for me looking at the white feminist  
<a onclick="modifyYTiframeseektime('853')">0:14:13</a> she to be honest is way more  
<a onclick="modifyYTiframeseektime('855')">0:14:15</a> self-consistent with her ideology than  
<a onclick="modifyYTiframeseektime('857')">0:14:17</a> the muslim who's attempting to be a  
<a onclick="modifyYTiframeseektime('859')">0:14:19</a> feminist who really is uh who's  
<a onclick="modifyYTiframeseektime('862')">0:14:22</a> sacrificing her religion is  
<a onclick="modifyYTiframeseektime('863')">0:14:23</a> contradictory in her stances because  
<a onclick="modifyYTiframeseektime('866')">0:14:26</a> this woman at least she's  
<a onclick="modifyYTiframeseektime('867')">0:14:27</a> self-consistent she realizes that  
<a onclick="modifyYTiframeseektime('869')">0:14:29</a> actually if feminism is an egalitarian  
<a onclick="modifyYTiframeseektime('871')">0:14:31</a> discourse especially if it's liberal  
<a onclick="modifyYTiframeseektime('872')">0:14:32</a> feminism  
<a onclick="modifyYTiframeseektime('873')">0:14:33</a> then it shouldn't ensure that people  
<a onclick="modifyYTiframeseektime('875')">0:14:35</a> have freedom of choice  
<a onclick="modifyYTiframeseektime('877')">0:14:37</a> and and she and also freedom and equal  
<a onclick="modifyYTiframeseektime('880')">0:14:40</a> opportunities and she starts to realize  
<a onclick="modifyYTiframeseektime('882')">0:14:42</a> okay this is how it should play out if  
<a onclick="modifyYTiframeseektime('884')">0:14:44</a> we are to be self-consistent the muslim  
<a onclick="modifyYTiframeseektime('887')">0:14:47</a> she has no care to try and represent uh  
<a onclick="modifyYTiframeseektime('889')">0:14:49</a> consistency or be consistent in any way  
<a onclick="modifyYTiframeseektime('892')">0:14:52</a> so she's just saying yeah it would  
<a onclick="modifyYTiframeseektime('893')">0:14:53</a> actually be better if it's run by women  
<a onclick="modifyYTiframeseektime('895')">0:14:55</a> but the problem is of course that islam  
<a onclick="modifyYTiframeseektime('897')">0:14:57</a> gives rights to men that it doesn't give  
<a onclick="modifyYTiframeseektime('899')">0:14:59</a> to women it gives responsibilities as  
<a onclick="modifyYTiframeseektime('900')">0:15:00</a> well to men that it does not give to  
<a onclick="modifyYTiframeseektime('901')">0:15:01</a> women  
<a onclick="modifyYTiframeseektime('902')">0:15:02</a> um  
<a onclick="modifyYTiframeseektime('903')">0:15:03</a> not least of course the fact that the  
<a onclick="modifyYTiframeseektime('904')">0:15:04</a> man is meant to be the manager of the  
<a onclick="modifyYTiframeseektime('906')">0:15:06</a> household  
<a onclick="modifyYTiframeseektime('911')">0:15:11</a> that men are is and protectors of women  
<a onclick="modifyYTiframeseektime('912')">0:15:12</a> but because of what he gave one over the  
<a onclick="modifyYTiframeseektime('914')">0:15:14</a> other  
<a onclick="modifyYTiframeseektime('915')">0:15:15</a> and the word  
<a onclick="modifyYTiframeseektime('916')">0:15:16</a> which is obedience you know for men to  
<a onclick="modifyYTiframeseektime('919')">0:15:19</a> women women to men in the in the  
<a onclick="modifyYTiframeseektime('921')">0:15:21</a> household is not something which is just  
<a onclick="modifyYTiframeseektime('923')">0:15:23</a> relegated to the hadith literature it's  
<a onclick="modifyYTiframeseektime('925')">0:15:25</a> actually in 434 itself  
<a onclick="modifyYTiframeseektime('927')">0:15:27</a> in the quran itself  
<a onclick="modifyYTiframeseektime('932')">0:15:32</a> if they obey you meaning this is the  
<a onclick="modifyYTiframeseektime('934')">0:15:34</a> normative state  
<a onclick="modifyYTiframeseektime('936')">0:15:36</a> the point is  
<a onclick="modifyYTiframeseektime('937')">0:15:37</a> if you're saying that the world will be  
<a onclick="modifyYTiframeseektime('938')">0:15:38</a> better run by women what is your stance  
<a onclick="modifyYTiframeseektime('941')">0:15:41</a> on men being leaders of every household  
<a onclick="modifyYTiframeseektime('944')">0:15:44</a> because  
<a onclick="modifyYTiframeseektime('945')">0:15:45</a> men being lead on an aggregate level  
<a onclick="modifyYTiframeseektime('947')">0:15:47</a> this would mean  
<a onclick="modifyYTiframeseektime('948')">0:15:48</a> that what you want is an inverse of  
<a onclick="modifyYTiframeseektime('950')">0:15:50</a> what's going on which is completely  
<a onclick="modifyYTiframeseektime('951')">0:15:51</a> anti-islamic what do you guys think i  
<a onclick="modifyYTiframeseektime('954')">0:15:54</a> think the  
<a onclick="modifyYTiframeseektime('955')">0:15:55</a> an interesting parallel you can draw is  
<a onclick="modifyYTiframeseektime('957')">0:15:57</a> with regards to approximately 124 000  
<a onclick="modifyYTiframeseektime('960')">0:16:00</a> prophets that have come and all of them  
<a onclick="modifyYTiframeseektime('961')">0:16:01</a> being male and leaders leaders of the  
<a onclick="modifyYTiframeseektime('964')">0:16:04</a> religion exactly imams the leaders of uh  
<a onclick="modifyYTiframeseektime('967')">0:16:07</a> every single congregational prayer  
<a onclick="modifyYTiframeseektime('969')">0:16:09</a> that's valid within the paradigm of  
<a onclick="modifyYTiframeseektime('970')">0:16:10</a> islam being a male figure what would be  
<a onclick="modifyYTiframeseektime('973')">0:16:13</a> your answer with regards to that so it  
<a onclick="modifyYTiframeseektime('975')">0:16:15</a> does seem contradictory to an islamic  
<a onclick="modifyYTiframeseektime('978')">0:16:18</a> point of view i think she could have  
<a onclick="modifyYTiframeseektime('980')">0:16:20</a> worded it better well alan if she  
<a onclick="modifyYTiframeseektime('982')">0:16:22</a> actually meant this  
<a onclick="modifyYTiframeseektime('983')">0:16:23</a> but it doesn't seem like she's somebody  
<a onclick="modifyYTiframeseektime('986')">0:16:26</a> that is  
<a onclick="modifyYTiframeseektime('988')">0:16:28</a> committed but i mean representative of  
<a onclick="modifyYTiframeseektime('990')">0:16:30</a> orthodox islam of course not the thing  
<a onclick="modifyYTiframeseektime('992')">0:16:32</a> is  
<a onclick="modifyYTiframeseektime('994')">0:16:34</a> to be quite honest with you she's sold  
<a onclick="modifyYTiframeseektime('996')">0:16:36</a> her soul to the left-wing ideologies and  
<a onclick="modifyYTiframeseektime('999')">0:16:39</a> for all intents and purposes this could  
<a onclick="modifyYTiframeseektime('1001')">0:16:41</a> lead to major coffer  
<a onclick="modifyYTiframeseektime('1004')">0:16:44</a> that takes someone out of the fold of  
<a onclick="modifyYTiframeseektime('1005')">0:16:45</a> islam and we have to just call the spare  
<a onclick="modifyYTiframeseektime('1007')">0:16:47</a> the spirit i'm not calling her kafer  
<a onclick="modifyYTiframeseektime('1009')">0:16:49</a> although what she's what she's  
<a onclick="modifyYTiframeseektime('1010')">0:16:50</a> representing is kofor akbar a major  
<a onclick="modifyYTiframeseektime('1012')">0:16:52</a> coffee and most of the positions of the

<a onclick="modifyYTiframeseektime('1017')">0:16:57</a> what we need to realize is that these

<a onclick="modifyYTiframeseektime('1021')">0:17:01</a> that's as simple as really as simple as  
<a onclick="modifyYTiframeseektime('1023')">0:17:03</a> that these positions are unacceptable  
<a onclick="modifyYTiframeseektime('1025')">0:17:05</a> islamically you need to realize that  
<a onclick="modifyYTiframeseektime('1027')">0:17:07</a> this is another it's another way of life  
<a onclick="modifyYTiframeseektime('1030')">0:17:10</a> it's another ideology you can call it if  
<a onclick="modifyYTiframeseektime('1032')">0:17:12</a> you like another religion yes second  
<a onclick="modifyYTiframeseektime('1034')">0:17:14</a> word feminism is like another religion  
<a onclick="modifyYTiframeseektime('1036')">0:17:16</a> that has different presuppositions

<a onclick="modifyYTiframeseektime('1041')">0:17:21</a> cannot maintain an islamic committed

<a onclick="modifyYTiframeseektime('1045')">0:17:25</a> point of view and this at the same time  
<a onclick="modifyYTiframeseektime('1047')">0:17:27</a> you will be cognitively dissonant which  
<a onclick="modifyYTiframeseektime('1050')">0:17:30</a> is a psychological disorder or you'll be

<a onclick="modifyYTiframeseektime('1070')">0:17:50</a> we're seeing more and more of these  
<a onclick="modifyYTiframeseektime('1071')">0:17:51</a> kinds of figures come up and they're  
<a onclick="modifyYTiframeseektime('1073')">0:17:53</a> trying to normalize it but there is no  
<a onclick="modifyYTiframeseektime('1074')">0:17:54</a> space for that in the islamic  
<a onclick="modifyYTiframeseektime('1075')">0:17:55</a> environment at all  
<a onclick="modifyYTiframeseektime('1077')">0:17:57</a> would you agree yeah of course you know  
<a onclick="modifyYTiframeseektime('1079')">0:17:59</a> we're happy with our religion you know  
<a onclick="modifyYTiframeseektime('1081')">0:18:01</a> we're pleased with our lord you know  
<a onclick="modifyYTiframeseektime('1082')">0:18:02</a> it's as simple as that man let's just  
<a onclick="modifyYTiframeseektime('1084')">0:18:04</a> get away with this insecurities you know  
<a onclick="modifyYTiframeseektime('1086')">0:18:06</a> at the end of the day it's as simple as  
<a onclick="modifyYTiframeseektime('1087')">0:18:07</a> that but that's why that's where it  
<a onclick="modifyYTiframeseektime('1088')">0:18:08</a> stems from we don't understand a lack of  
<a onclick="modifyYTiframeseektime('1090')">0:18:10</a> tolhee not knowing your religion it's  
<a onclick="modifyYTiframeseektime('1092')">0:18:12</a> true and the weapons is then you become  
<a onclick="modifyYTiframeseektime('1093')">0:18:13</a> like a is it a leaf that you know  
<a onclick="modifyYTiframeseektime('1095')">0:18:15</a> wherever the wind blows you you know  
<a onclick="modifyYTiframeseektime('1096')">0:18:16</a> you're you're wherever where feminism oh  
<a onclick="modifyYTiframeseektime('1098')">0:18:18</a> i'm a feminist that's what it boils down  
<a onclick="modifyYTiframeseektime('1100')">0:18:20</a> to guys you know and that's where the  
<a onclick="modifyYTiframeseektime('1101')">0:18:21</a> root of the problem is be proud be happy  
<a onclick="modifyYTiframeseektime('1104')">0:18:24</a> you know if you see a one phenomena is  
<a onclick="modifyYTiframeseektime('1106')">0:18:26</a> islam has all these regulations and laws  
<a onclick="modifyYTiframeseektime('1109')">0:18:29</a> and stuff in place which is totally  
<a onclick="modifyYTiframeseektime('1111')">0:18:31</a> opposing to the liberal view but  
<a onclick="modifyYTiframeseektime('1113')">0:18:33</a> thousands of people come to islam  
<a onclick="modifyYTiframeseektime('1114')">0:18:34</a> because the thing is when you're true to  
<a onclick="modifyYTiframeseektime('1116')">0:18:36</a> yourself like if i you know once i i  
<a onclick="modifyYTiframeseektime('1118')">0:18:38</a> spent three years looking into different

<a onclick="modifyYTiframeseektime('1175')">0:19:35</a> just one small thought comes to mind  
<a onclick="modifyYTiframeseektime('1177')">0:19:37</a> which is what a scholar said that back  
<a onclick="modifyYTiframeseektime('1178')">0:19:38</a> in the days we had masjids  
<a onclick="modifyYTiframeseektime('1181')">0:19:41</a> the mosques  
<a onclick="modifyYTiframeseektime('1182')">0:19:42</a> that were unbaked they were made from  
<a onclick="modifyYTiframeseektime('1184')">0:19:44</a> unbaked clay  
<a onclick="modifyYTiframeseektime('1185')">0:19:45</a> yeah but the people that emerged from  
<a onclick="modifyYTiframeseektime('1187')">0:19:47</a> them was gonna be a good one take a step  
<a onclick="modifyYTiframeseektime('1189')">0:19:49</a> back  
<a onclick="modifyYTiframeseektime('1190')">0:19:50</a> they were baked but today the masjids  
<a onclick="modifyYTiframeseektime('1193')">0:19:53</a> are baked but the people that emerge  
<a onclick="modifyYTiframeseektime('1195')">0:19:55</a> from the masjids are unbaked  
<a onclick="modifyYTiframeseektime('1198')">0:19:58</a> so i mean we although we we have stepped  
<a onclick="modifyYTiframeseektime('1200')">0:20:00</a> up we  
<a onclick="modifyYTiframeseektime('1202')">0:20:02</a> although we have  
<a onclick="modifyYTiframeseektime('1203')">0:20:03</a> like  
<a onclick="modifyYTiframeseektime('1204')">0:20:04</a> billions 1.8 billion muslims  
<a onclick="modifyYTiframeseektime('1208')">0:20:08</a> but  
<a onclick="modifyYTiframeseektime('1209')">0:20:09</a> if we only had 313 with the caliber of  
<a onclick="modifyYTiframeseektime('1212')">0:20:12</a> badr today we would be on a different  
<a onclick="modifyYTiframeseektime('1215')">0:20:15</a> plane exactly so we need to take a leaf  
<a onclick="modifyYTiframeseektime('1217')">0:20:17</a> from these muslims read the seerah the  
<a onclick="modifyYTiframeseektime('1220')">0:20:20</a> history and and and go and take the  
<a onclick="modifyYTiframeseektime('1223')">0:20:23</a> positives from that time and one of the  
<a onclick="modifyYTiframeseektime('1226')">0:20:26</a> positives that we've highlighted is  
<a onclick="modifyYTiframeseektime('1227')">0:20:27</a> being confident in your religion and  
<a onclick="modifyYTiframeseektime('1229')">0:20:29</a> number two having knowledge of your

<a onclick="modifyYTiframeseektime('1237')">0:20:37</a> of the process which mentions this that  
<a onclick="modifyYTiframeseektime('1239')">0:20:39</a> on that day or the process tell them
