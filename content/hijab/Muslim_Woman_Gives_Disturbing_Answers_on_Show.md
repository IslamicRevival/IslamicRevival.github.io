She mentions that when pbe hits, it's no longer a question for her to remember going to a boxing club when she was younger. She also mentions the club, but one of the top female boxers in the UK actually who represented GB in the Olympics, was a woman. When she thinks back to the first year that female boxing was available, she remembers that she was basically sparring with other women her age. According to the schools of thought in Islamic jurisprudence, three out of four schools say that after 120 days, a woman can abort. One school of thought says that after 40 days. She then says, "It's inconceivable to think that after 120 days, a Muslim can believe in something referred to as 'late stage terminal abortion.'"  goes on to ask, "Should we move on to the next one because I think here we're assuming the best?" The woman agrees and says, "Yes, here we go, hi guys."

[0:00:28](https://youtu.be/0eUfu5Wrh5E?t=28) i'm here with big g and a plus  
[0:00:32](https://youtu.be/0eUfu5Wrh5E?t=32) yes okay  
[0:00:35](https://youtu.be/0eUfu5Wrh5E?t=35) and here as well big h of course with  
[0:00:38](https://youtu.be/0eUfu5Wrh5E?t=38) you guys where is he  
[0:00:40](https://youtu.be/0eUfu5Wrh5E?t=40) [Laughter]  
[0:00:42](https://youtu.be/0eUfu5Wrh5E?t=42) today we're going to be reacting to a  
[0:00:44](https://youtu.be/0eUfu5Wrh5E?t=44) video which i came across which has many  
[0:00:45](https://youtu.be/0eUfu5Wrh5E?t=45) many views uh about seven million  
[0:00:48](https://youtu.be/0eUfu5Wrh5E?t=48) actually i was surprised i didn't come  
[0:00:49](https://youtu.be/0eUfu5Wrh5E?t=49) across this video or that no one sent it  
[0:00:51](https://youtu.be/0eUfu5Wrh5E?t=51) to me before i think we were all  
[0:00:52](https://youtu.be/0eUfu5Wrh5E?t=52) surprised actually because this video  
[0:00:53](https://youtu.be/0eUfu5Wrh5E?t=53) was quite interesting it is actually  
[0:00:54](https://youtu.be/0eUfu5Wrh5E?t=54) yeah not least because there was  
[0:00:56](https://youtu.be/0eUfu5Wrh5E?t=56) actually a muslim representative  
[0:00:59](https://youtu.be/0eUfu5Wrh5E?t=59) did she represent  
[0:01:00](https://youtu.be/0eUfu5Wrh5E?t=60) exactly this is the question right there  
[0:01:02](https://youtu.be/0eUfu5Wrh5E?t=62) was a muslim woman there who at least  
[0:01:04](https://youtu.be/0eUfu5Wrh5E?t=64) looked like a muslim but did not sound  
[0:01:06](https://youtu.be/0eUfu5Wrh5E?t=66) like one  
[0:01:07](https://youtu.be/0eUfu5Wrh5E?t=67) who was answering these questions and  
[0:01:09](https://youtu.be/0eUfu5Wrh5E?t=69) the way this this program works the  
[0:01:10](https://youtu.be/0eUfu5Wrh5E?t=70) spectrum is that they've asked these  
[0:01:12](https://youtu.be/0eUfu5Wrh5E?t=72) questions and then they would stand  
[0:01:14](https://youtu.be/0eUfu5Wrh5E?t=74) on a spectrum  
[0:01:15](https://youtu.be/0eUfu5Wrh5E?t=75) okay on whether they agree  
[0:01:18](https://youtu.be/0eUfu5Wrh5E?t=78) or to what extent they agree and or  
[0:01:19](https://youtu.be/0eUfu5Wrh5E?t=79) disagree  
[0:01:20](https://youtu.be/0eUfu5Wrh5E?t=80) and so there are there are a few  
[0:01:22](https://youtu.be/0eUfu5Wrh5E?t=82) questions here that were asked i think  
[0:01:23](https://youtu.be/0eUfu5Wrh5E?t=83) which are person into the public  
[0:01:24](https://youtu.be/0eUfu5Wrh5E?t=84) discourse which we want to react to so  
[0:01:27](https://youtu.be/0eUfu5Wrh5E?t=87) let's let's look at the first thing  
[0:01:29](https://youtu.be/0eUfu5Wrh5E?t=89) that i i felt was um  
[0:01:32](https://youtu.be/0eUfu5Wrh5E?t=92) pretty important  
[0:01:35](https://youtu.be/0eUfu5Wrh5E?t=95) i actually don't want kids but if i were  
[0:01:37](https://youtu.be/0eUfu5Wrh5E?t=97) to decide to do that i would want them  
[0:01:40](https://youtu.be/0eUfu5Wrh5E?t=100) to to grow up in that environment where  
[0:01:42](https://youtu.be/0eUfu5Wrh5E?t=102) there's no difference between you two  
[0:01:44](https://youtu.be/0eUfu5Wrh5E?t=104) you don't have like a curfew that she  
[0:01:46](https://youtu.be/0eUfu5Wrh5E?t=106) doesn't have or vice versa so hijab what  
[0:01:49](https://youtu.be/0eUfu5Wrh5E?t=109) do you think about that because that's  
[0:01:49](https://youtu.be/0eUfu5Wrh5E?t=109) something a bit you know i would say  
[0:01:51](https://youtu.be/0eUfu5Wrh5E?t=111) well close to all of our hearts but you  
[0:01:53](https://youtu.be/0eUfu5Wrh5E?t=113) know to see a muslim woman um saying  
[0:01:55](https://youtu.be/0eUfu5Wrh5E?t=115) what she said or moving to where she  
[0:01:57](https://youtu.be/0eUfu5Wrh5E?t=117) moved was it the right move  
[0:01:58](https://youtu.be/0eUfu5Wrh5E?t=118) no i don't i don't think it was the  
[0:02:00](https://youtu.be/0eUfu5Wrh5E?t=120) right move but um we can employ hosni  
[0:02:02](https://youtu.be/0eUfu5Wrh5E?t=122) van here or the  
[0:02:03](https://youtu.be/0eUfu5Wrh5E?t=123) thinking good because at this point in  
[0:02:05](https://youtu.be/0eUfu5Wrh5E?t=125) time you can see that generically i mean  
[0:02:08](https://youtu.be/0eUfu5Wrh5E?t=128) when you're raising boys and girls there  
[0:02:09](https://youtu.be/0eUfu5Wrh5E?t=129) are not that many differences in the way  
[0:02:11](https://youtu.be/0eUfu5Wrh5E?t=131) that you're going to raise both of them  
[0:02:12](https://youtu.be/0eUfu5Wrh5E?t=132) in fact there are many rules in islam  
[0:02:14](https://youtu.be/0eUfu5Wrh5E?t=134) which indicate that you should be equal  
[0:02:16](https://youtu.be/0eUfu5Wrh5E?t=136) in gifts  
[0:02:17](https://youtu.be/0eUfu5Wrh5E?t=137) and time spent and your love that you  
[0:02:19](https://youtu.be/0eUfu5Wrh5E?t=139) have for both boys and girls so  
[0:02:21](https://youtu.be/0eUfu5Wrh5E?t=141) generically i mean  
[0:02:22](https://youtu.be/0eUfu5Wrh5E?t=142) uh i don't think it's wrong however  
[0:02:24](https://youtu.be/0eUfu5Wrh5E?t=144) there are obviously differences  
[0:02:26](https://youtu.be/0eUfu5Wrh5E?t=146) especially as boys and girls become  
[0:02:28](https://youtu.be/0eUfu5Wrh5E?t=148) closer to puberty  
[0:02:29](https://youtu.be/0eUfu5Wrh5E?t=149) and become closer to adulthood so  
[0:02:32](https://youtu.be/0eUfu5Wrh5E?t=152) that's what i would say like for for  
[0:02:33](https://youtu.be/0eUfu5Wrh5E?t=153) instance  
[0:02:35](https://youtu.be/0eUfu5Wrh5E?t=155) a boy now who's becoming a man has to  
[0:02:38](https://youtu.be/0eUfu5Wrh5E?t=158) start thinking about protection the  
[0:02:39](https://youtu.be/0eUfu5Wrh5E?t=159) protective role that they would have  
[0:02:42](https://youtu.be/0eUfu5Wrh5E?t=162) this is something we believe in we  
[0:02:43](https://youtu.be/0eUfu5Wrh5E?t=163) believe that for example a boy a son and  
[0:02:45](https://youtu.be/0eUfu5Wrh5E?t=165) a daughter  
[0:02:46](https://youtu.be/0eUfu5Wrh5E?t=166) knowing that the son has advantages  
[0:02:49](https://youtu.be/0eUfu5Wrh5E?t=169) which are anatomical in nature  
[0:02:51](https://youtu.be/0eUfu5Wrh5E?t=171) clearly you would you would guide the  
[0:02:52](https://youtu.be/0eUfu5Wrh5E?t=172) sun to be protective of over the  
[0:02:54](https://youtu.be/0eUfu5Wrh5E?t=174) daughter in a way that you wouldn't tell  
[0:02:56](https://youtu.be/0eUfu5Wrh5E?t=176) the daughter to be protective over the  
[0:02:58](https://youtu.be/0eUfu5Wrh5E?t=178) sun i don't know how to accent do you  
[0:03:00](https://youtu.be/0eUfu5Wrh5E?t=180) agree with uh with that no exactly even  
[0:03:02](https://youtu.be/0eUfu5Wrh5E?t=182) biologically that follows you know i've  
[0:03:04](https://youtu.be/0eUfu5Wrh5E?t=184) had a discussion with feminists in the  
[0:03:05](https://youtu.be/0eUfu5Wrh5E?t=185) park as well you know it's it's it's sad  
[0:03:07](https://youtu.be/0eUfu5Wrh5E?t=187) you know for them to deny their own  
[0:03:08](https://youtu.be/0eUfu5Wrh5E?t=188) biology you know and we're not talking  
[0:03:10](https://youtu.be/0eUfu5Wrh5E?t=190) about exceptions they'll come and say oh  
[0:03:11](https://youtu.be/0eUfu5Wrh5E?t=191) but if there's a woman that's a  
[0:03:12](https://youtu.be/0eUfu5Wrh5E?t=192) kickboxer we're not talking about that  
[0:03:13](https://youtu.be/0eUfu5Wrh5E?t=193) you know it's it's the duty of the male  
[0:03:16](https://youtu.be/0eUfu5Wrh5E?t=196) and like allah says men are the  
[0:03:17](https://youtu.be/0eUfu5Wrh5E?t=197) maintainers and practices of women  
[0:03:18](https://youtu.be/0eUfu5Wrh5E?t=198) period if the one who created me said  
[0:03:20](https://youtu.be/0eUfu5Wrh5E?t=200) that there's there's nothing else that  
[0:03:21](https://youtu.be/0eUfu5Wrh5E?t=201) needs to be loved that's what i was  
[0:03:23](https://youtu.be/0eUfu5Wrh5E?t=203) saying without delving in too much  
[0:03:26](https://youtu.be/0eUfu5Wrh5E?t=206) yeah i was gonna say that if if i was to  
[0:03:29](https://youtu.be/0eUfu5Wrh5E?t=209) push back and play devil's advocate i  
[0:03:32](https://youtu.be/0eUfu5Wrh5E?t=212) would say okay but here we're talking  
[0:03:34](https://youtu.be/0eUfu5Wrh5E?t=214) about kids  
[0:03:35](https://youtu.be/0eUfu5Wrh5E?t=215) should you not be bringing them all up  
[0:03:37](https://youtu.be/0eUfu5Wrh5E?t=217) as protectors should they not all be  
[0:03:40](https://youtu.be/0eUfu5Wrh5E?t=220) exposed to that no what's the definition  
[0:03:41](https://youtu.be/0eUfu5Wrh5E?t=221) protected  
[0:03:42](https://youtu.be/0eUfu5Wrh5E?t=222) look firstly if i have a daughter and  
[0:03:44](https://youtu.be/0eUfu5Wrh5E?t=224) have a son i'll both tell them both how  
[0:03:47](https://youtu.be/0eUfu5Wrh5E?t=227) to protect myself and i'm sure even your  
[0:03:49](https://youtu.be/0eUfu5Wrh5E?t=229) could you send them to bjj you know so  
[0:03:52](https://youtu.be/0eUfu5Wrh5E?t=232) even though you're  
[0:03:53](https://youtu.be/0eUfu5Wrh5E?t=233) against this but in your life you  
[0:03:55](https://youtu.be/0eUfu5Wrh5E?t=235) practice like you take your daughter and  
[0:03:57](https://youtu.be/0eUfu5Wrh5E?t=237) your son to bjj however let's be real  
[0:03:59](https://youtu.be/0eUfu5Wrh5E?t=239) here that when they grow up yeah that we  
[0:04:01](https://youtu.be/0eUfu5Wrh5E?t=241) need to be real with them and tell them  
[0:04:03](https://youtu.be/0eUfu5Wrh5E?t=243) you know and i'm sure they would realize  
[0:04:04](https://youtu.be/0eUfu5Wrh5E?t=244) that with their own biology they'll  
[0:04:05](https://youtu.be/0eUfu5Wrh5E?t=245) understand that a man is tend to be more  
[0:04:07](https://youtu.be/0eUfu5Wrh5E?t=247) stronger and their brother is there to  
[0:04:08](https://youtu.be/0eUfu5Wrh5E?t=248) protect you  
[0:04:09](https://youtu.be/0eUfu5Wrh5E?t=249) why should we be afraid of that that's  
[0:04:11](https://youtu.be/0eUfu5Wrh5E?t=251) why i would say that and you know on  
[0:04:12](https://youtu.be/0eUfu5Wrh5E?t=252) this point you know i take my child to i  
[0:04:15](https://youtu.be/0eUfu5Wrh5E?t=255) would do we do everything with like in  
[0:04:17](https://youtu.be/0eUfu5Wrh5E?t=257) terms of self defense my two i've got  
[0:04:18](https://youtu.be/0eUfu5Wrh5E?t=258) two daughters as you know but the thing  
[0:04:21](https://youtu.be/0eUfu5Wrh5E?t=261) is  
[0:04:22](https://youtu.be/0eUfu5Wrh5E?t=262) i do that now when she's very young and  
[0:04:24](https://youtu.be/0eUfu5Wrh5E?t=264) prepubescent and the same thing with my  
[0:04:26](https://youtu.be/0eUfu5Wrh5E?t=266) son but the moment puberty kicks in i  
[0:04:28](https://youtu.be/0eUfu5Wrh5E?t=268) mean people don't realize the effect of  
[0:04:29](https://youtu.be/0eUfu5Wrh5E?t=269) testosterone when testosterone comes  
[0:04:32](https://youtu.be/0eUfu5Wrh5E?t=272) into the picture i mean it's changing it  
[0:04:35](https://youtu.be/0eUfu5Wrh5E?t=275) actually increases muscle mass by up to  
[0:04:37](https://youtu.be/0eUfu5Wrh5E?t=277) fifty percent  
[0:04:39](https://youtu.be/0eUfu5Wrh5E?t=279) fifty five zero percent  
[0:04:41](https://youtu.be/0eUfu5Wrh5E?t=281) so now you know this is very interesting  
[0:04:45](https://youtu.be/0eUfu5Wrh5E?t=285) you see children right when they grow  
[0:04:47](https://youtu.be/0eUfu5Wrh5E?t=287) older and you see how like for example  
[0:04:49](https://youtu.be/0eUfu5Wrh5E?t=289) girls versus boys before the pubescent  
[0:04:51](https://youtu.be/0eUfu5Wrh5E?t=291) stage girls can sometimes really  
[0:04:53](https://youtu.be/0eUfu5Wrh5E?t=293) dominate boys because they don't there's  
[0:04:55](https://youtu.be/0eUfu5Wrh5E?t=295) no like testosterone advantage and these  
[0:04:58](https://youtu.be/0eUfu5Wrh5E?t=298) kind of things you see that very it's  
[0:04:59](https://youtu.be/0eUfu5Wrh5E?t=299) very often um very common but then when  
[0:05:02](https://youtu.be/0eUfu5Wrh5E?t=302) when pbe hits that's no longer a  
[0:05:03](https://youtu.be/0eUfu5Wrh5E?t=303) question i remember i remember going to  
[0:05:05](https://youtu.be/0eUfu5Wrh5E?t=305) a boxing club when i was younger i want  
[0:05:06](https://youtu.be/0eUfu5Wrh5E?t=306) to mention the club but one of the top  
[0:05:08](https://youtu.be/0eUfu5Wrh5E?t=308) female boxers in the uk actually who  
[0:05:10](https://youtu.be/0eUfu5Wrh5E?t=310) represented gb in  
[0:05:12](https://youtu.be/0eUfu5Wrh5E?t=312) the olympics okay  
[0:05:14](https://youtu.be/0eUfu5Wrh5E?t=314) when i think the first year they had  
[0:05:16](https://youtu.be/0eUfu5Wrh5E?t=316) female boxing yeah  
[0:05:18](https://youtu.be/0eUfu5Wrh5E?t=318) she was basically sparring she was a  
[0:05:20](https://youtu.be/0eUfu5Wrh5E?t=320) woman she was part of the 14 year old  
[0:05:21](https://youtu.be/0eUfu5Wrh5E?t=321) boys  
[0:05:23](https://youtu.be/0eUfu5Wrh5E?t=323) 13 14 year olds yeah eights and your  
[0:05:24](https://youtu.be/0eUfu5Wrh5E?t=324) nines she would be inconceivable to put  
[0:05:27](https://youtu.be/0eUfu5Wrh5E?t=327) her in with you know a 21 year old or  
[0:05:30](https://youtu.be/0eUfu5Wrh5E?t=330) something like that  
[0:05:32](https://youtu.be/0eUfu5Wrh5E?t=332) who's her weight or equal weight because  
[0:05:34](https://youtu.be/0eUfu5Wrh5E?t=334) the advantages are so well described  
[0:05:36](https://youtu.be/0eUfu5Wrh5E?t=336) then everyone knows in in that industry  
[0:05:38](https://youtu.be/0eUfu5Wrh5E?t=338) that it would be so disadvantageous for  
[0:05:39](https://youtu.be/0eUfu5Wrh5E?t=339) them okay should we move on to the next  
[0:05:41](https://youtu.be/0eUfu5Wrh5E?t=341) one because i think here we're assuming  
[0:05:42](https://youtu.be/0eUfu5Wrh5E?t=342) the best  
[0:05:53](https://youtu.be/0eUfu5Wrh5E?t=353) oh here we go hi guys  
[0:05:58](https://youtu.be/0eUfu5Wrh5E?t=358) second that i agree with that statement  
[0:06:00](https://youtu.be/0eUfu5Wrh5E?t=360) but i feel like the heavy restrictions  
[0:06:03](https://youtu.be/0eUfu5Wrh5E?t=363) that are placed on it by our government  
[0:06:05](https://youtu.be/0eUfu5Wrh5E?t=365) just dictating what we can do with our  
[0:06:06](https://youtu.be/0eUfu5Wrh5E?t=366) bodies is really infuriating and then  
[0:06:08](https://youtu.be/0eUfu5Wrh5E?t=368) seeing people who have kids and resent  
[0:06:10](https://youtu.be/0eUfu5Wrh5E?t=370) it for the rest of their lives and  
[0:06:12](https://youtu.be/0eUfu5Wrh5E?t=372) raising children that they never wanted  
[0:06:14](https://youtu.be/0eUfu5Wrh5E?t=374) it's frustrating and so do you think  
[0:06:16](https://youtu.be/0eUfu5Wrh5E?t=376) that those parents that are struggling  
[0:06:18](https://youtu.be/0eUfu5Wrh5E?t=378) with raising their children that they  
[0:06:19](https://youtu.be/0eUfu5Wrh5E?t=379) didn't have the option for adoption or  
[0:06:22](https://youtu.be/0eUfu5Wrh5E?t=382) other ways it depends like for a lot of  
[0:06:25](https://youtu.be/0eUfu5Wrh5E?t=385) cultures adoption is not okay so as you  
[0:06:27](https://youtu.be/0eUfu5Wrh5E?t=387) guys saw she was strongly agreeing with  
[0:06:30](https://youtu.be/0eUfu5Wrh5E?t=390) abortion but we know this just to make  
[0:06:31](https://youtu.be/0eUfu5Wrh5E?t=391) this clear  
[0:06:32](https://youtu.be/0eUfu5Wrh5E?t=392) that according to the the schools of  
[0:06:34](https://youtu.be/0eUfu5Wrh5E?t=394) thought in islamic jurisprudence three  
[0:06:36](https://youtu.be/0eUfu5Wrh5E?t=396) out of four schools say  
[0:06:38](https://youtu.be/0eUfu5Wrh5E?t=398) that after 120 days i mean up to 120  
[0:06:41](https://youtu.be/0eUfu5Wrh5E?t=401) days you can abort  
[0:06:43](https://youtu.be/0eUfu5Wrh5E?t=403) in certain circumstances not not all  
[0:06:45](https://youtu.be/0eUfu5Wrh5E?t=405) circumstances and one school of thought  
[0:06:47](https://youtu.be/0eUfu5Wrh5E?t=407) says 40 days  
[0:06:48](https://youtu.be/0eUfu5Wrh5E?t=408) it's inconceivable to think that after  
[0:06:51](https://youtu.be/0eUfu5Wrh5E?t=411) 120 days that a muslim  
[0:06:54](https://youtu.be/0eUfu5Wrh5E?t=414) can believe in something referred to as  
[0:06:56](https://youtu.be/0eUfu5Wrh5E?t=416) late stage terminal abortion  
[0:06:59](https://youtu.be/0eUfu5Wrh5E?t=419) which is as you know in in america in  
[0:07:02](https://youtu.be/0eUfu5Wrh5E?t=422) different parts of the western world and  
[0:07:03](https://youtu.be/0eUfu5Wrh5E?t=423) different parts of the world can go up  
[0:07:05](https://youtu.be/0eUfu5Wrh5E?t=425) to six months which if you've ever seen  
[0:07:07](https://youtu.be/0eUfu5Wrh5E?t=427) a child a child can survive in six  
[0:07:09](https://youtu.be/0eUfu5Wrh5E?t=429) months the way they take and we couldn't  
[0:07:11](https://youtu.be/0eUfu5Wrh5E?t=431) even put this like as a picture of you  
[0:07:13](https://youtu.be/0eUfu5Wrh5E?t=433) know a video how they actually extract  
[0:07:16](https://youtu.be/0eUfu5Wrh5E?t=436) and cut up a baby that's five months old  
[0:07:18](https://youtu.be/0eUfu5Wrh5E?t=438) literally a viable child a viable when i  
[0:07:21](https://youtu.be/0eUfu5Wrh5E?t=441) say viable i'm talking about living it  
[0:07:23](https://youtu.be/0eUfu5Wrh5E?t=443) has a pulse it has a heart it has organs  
[0:07:25](https://youtu.be/0eUfu5Wrh5E?t=445) it has a brain it can  
[0:07:28](https://youtu.be/0eUfu5Wrh5E?t=448) it can  
[0:07:28](https://youtu.be/0eUfu5Wrh5E?t=448) it has a nervous system you killed this  
[0:07:31](https://youtu.be/0eUfu5Wrh5E?t=451) child practically  
[0:07:33](https://youtu.be/0eUfu5Wrh5E?t=453) you're saying that a woman should have  
[0:07:34](https://youtu.be/0eUfu5Wrh5E?t=454) the right to do this  
[0:07:36](https://youtu.be/0eUfu5Wrh5E?t=456) on what grounds do you think this is  
[0:07:37](https://youtu.be/0eUfu5Wrh5E?t=457) commensurate with the islamic teaching  
[0:07:39](https://youtu.be/0eUfu5Wrh5E?t=459) to be honest i believe this it's it's  
[0:07:40](https://youtu.be/0eUfu5Wrh5E?t=460) just based on nothing no rationale no  
[0:07:42](https://youtu.be/0eUfu5Wrh5E?t=462) logic it's just basically  
[0:07:44](https://youtu.be/0eUfu5Wrh5E?t=464) i see an insecure muslim woman yeah  
[0:07:47](https://youtu.be/0eUfu5Wrh5E?t=467) who's dominated uh yes you know with  
[0:07:49](https://youtu.be/0eUfu5Wrh5E?t=469) ideologically yeah in the west yes and  
[0:07:51](https://youtu.be/0eUfu5Wrh5E?t=471) she's just basically  
[0:07:53](https://youtu.be/0eUfu5Wrh5E?t=473) like she's just saying you know i'm here  
[0:07:54](https://youtu.be/0eUfu5Wrh5E?t=474) do wherever you like me and wherever you  
[0:07:56](https://youtu.be/0eUfu5Wrh5E?t=476) go i'm to follow you that's what i see  
[0:07:58](https://youtu.be/0eUfu5Wrh5E?t=478) because there is no way if i sat that  
[0:07:59](https://youtu.be/0eUfu5Wrh5E?t=479) sister down i said do you genuinely  
[0:08:01](https://youtu.be/0eUfu5Wrh5E?t=481) believe this she would say to me  
[0:08:03](https://youtu.be/0eUfu5Wrh5E?t=483) i hope she would say to me no like i  
[0:08:04](https://youtu.be/0eUfu5Wrh5E?t=484) don't even know if i can say that she  
[0:08:06](https://youtu.be/0eUfu5Wrh5E?t=486) will say no and i hope she will say no  
[0:08:08](https://youtu.be/0eUfu5Wrh5E?t=488) but the thing is here how could you can  
[0:08:09](https://youtu.be/0eUfu5Wrh5E?t=489) you imagine this sister she's going to  
[0:08:11](https://youtu.be/0eUfu5Wrh5E?t=491) watch this i don't know if you have kids  
[0:08:13](https://youtu.be/0eUfu5Wrh5E?t=493) imagine you have a child and i want you  
[0:08:15](https://youtu.be/0eUfu5Wrh5E?t=495) to look at that child after you after  
[0:08:17](https://youtu.be/0eUfu5Wrh5E?t=497) you look at that child i want you to  
[0:08:18](https://youtu.be/0eUfu5Wrh5E?t=498) look at that child and say you know what  
[0:08:20](https://youtu.be/0eUfu5Wrh5E?t=500) your sibling  
[0:08:22](https://youtu.be/0eUfu5Wrh5E?t=502) imagine bro  
[0:08:23](https://youtu.be/0eUfu5Wrh5E?t=503) they were ripped piece by piece piece by  
[0:08:26](https://youtu.be/0eUfu5Wrh5E?t=506) piece because we need to put this into  
[0:08:28](https://youtu.be/0eUfu5Wrh5E?t=508) perspective when you come in and say oh  
[0:08:29](https://youtu.be/0eUfu5Wrh5E?t=509) that's wrong no no look at your child  
[0:08:31](https://youtu.be/0eUfu5Wrh5E?t=511) and say and if you did ever do abortion  
[0:08:33](https://youtu.be/0eUfu5Wrh5E?t=513) may allah forgive you and repent look at  
[0:08:35](https://youtu.be/0eUfu5Wrh5E?t=515) your child and say one of your siblings  
[0:08:37](https://youtu.be/0eUfu5Wrh5E?t=517) that died  
[0:08:39](https://youtu.be/0eUfu5Wrh5E?t=519) or killed not died killed and bit by lib  
[0:08:42](https://youtu.be/0eUfu5Wrh5E?t=522) limb by limb and we ripped them into  
[0:08:44](https://youtu.be/0eUfu5Wrh5E?t=524) pieces  
[0:08:46](https://youtu.be/0eUfu5Wrh5E?t=526) you're not talking about early abortion  
[0:08:47](https://youtu.be/0eUfu5Wrh5E?t=527) yeah  
[0:08:48](https://youtu.be/0eUfu5Wrh5E?t=528) no we're talking about five months yes  
[0:08:50](https://youtu.be/0eUfu5Wrh5E?t=530) but she's she's saying totally agree  
[0:08:51](https://youtu.be/0eUfu5Wrh5E?t=531) about her and the question is very clear  
[0:08:53](https://youtu.be/0eUfu5Wrh5E?t=533) so yes so  
[0:08:55](https://youtu.be/0eUfu5Wrh5E?t=535) limb by limb you've literally killed  
[0:08:57](https://youtu.be/0eUfu5Wrh5E?t=537) your own child you've killed your own  
[0:08:58](https://youtu.be/0eUfu5Wrh5E?t=538) child so you should  
[0:09:00](https://youtu.be/0eUfu5Wrh5E?t=540) bring up the child and say this is what  
[0:09:02](https://youtu.be/0eUfu5Wrh5E?t=542) i did to your sibling would you do that  
[0:09:07](https://youtu.be/0eUfu5Wrh5E?t=547) the quran states that when the child  
[0:09:09](https://youtu.be/0eUfu5Wrh5E?t=549) that the female interestingly  
[0:09:11](https://youtu.be/0eUfu5Wrh5E?t=551) female infanticide that the quran is  
[0:09:13](https://youtu.be/0eUfu5Wrh5E?t=553) against when the female child  
[0:09:15](https://youtu.be/0eUfu5Wrh5E?t=555) says for what for what sin did i what  
[0:09:18](https://youtu.be/0eUfu5Wrh5E?t=558) did you kill me for yes yes  
[0:09:22](https://youtu.be/0eUfu5Wrh5E?t=562) [Music]  
[0:09:24](https://youtu.be/0eUfu5Wrh5E?t=564) what did you kill me for feminism  
[0:09:25](https://youtu.be/0eUfu5Wrh5E?t=565) exactly no no no no no what did you kill  
[0:09:26](https://youtu.be/0eUfu5Wrh5E?t=566) me can you watch under the judgement  
[0:09:28](https://youtu.be/0eUfu5Wrh5E?t=568) what did you kill me for uh for uh an  
[0:09:30](https://youtu.be/0eUfu5Wrh5E?t=570) ideology because i was insecure  
[0:09:34](https://youtu.be/0eUfu5Wrh5E?t=574) i think what's interesting here is the  
[0:09:36](https://youtu.be/0eUfu5Wrh5E?t=576) the slogan they use is my body my choice  
[0:09:39](https://youtu.be/0eUfu5Wrh5E?t=579) but absolutely your body it's not your  
[0:09:40](https://youtu.be/0eUfu5Wrh5E?t=580) body  
[0:09:42](https://youtu.be/0eUfu5Wrh5E?t=582) it's my body one bro one brother made a  
[0:09:44](https://youtu.be/0eUfu5Wrh5E?t=584) very good choice  
[0:09:45](https://youtu.be/0eUfu5Wrh5E?t=585) not choice he made a very good point and  
[0:09:47](https://youtu.be/0eUfu5Wrh5E?t=587) he said  
[0:09:48](https://youtu.be/0eUfu5Wrh5E?t=588) that puts the whole kind of impetus on  
[0:09:50](https://youtu.be/0eUfu5Wrh5E?t=590) the past person themselves but they're  
[0:09:52](https://youtu.be/0eUfu5Wrh5E?t=592) not the only one that's responsible or  
[0:09:55](https://youtu.be/0eUfu5Wrh5E?t=595) affected by that decision exactly that's  
[0:09:56](https://youtu.be/0eUfu5Wrh5E?t=596) right what about the choice of the  
[0:09:58](https://youtu.be/0eUfu5Wrh5E?t=598) father what about the choice of the  
[0:10:00](https://youtu.be/0eUfu5Wrh5E?t=600) grandfather about the choice of the  
[0:10:01](https://youtu.be/0eUfu5Wrh5E?t=601) family these sorts of things it's like  
[0:10:03](https://youtu.be/0eUfu5Wrh5E?t=603) you mentioned about human rights it's  
[0:10:05](https://youtu.be/0eUfu5Wrh5E?t=605) all about  
[0:10:06](https://youtu.be/0eUfu5Wrh5E?t=606) what you owed and not what you owe and  
[0:10:09](https://youtu.be/0eUfu5Wrh5E?t=609) that's one of the issues that we have  
[0:10:10](https://youtu.be/0eUfu5Wrh5E?t=610) with this that's point number one point  
[0:10:11](https://youtu.be/0eUfu5Wrh5E?t=611) number two even  
[0:10:13](https://youtu.be/0eUfu5Wrh5E?t=613) ronaldo himself he was one of the  
[0:10:15](https://youtu.be/0eUfu5Wrh5E?t=615) children and he mentions this in his  
[0:10:18](https://youtu.be/0eUfu5Wrh5E?t=618) documentary that he was supposed to be  
[0:10:19](https://youtu.be/0eUfu5Wrh5E?t=619) aborted he was supposed to be gone but  
[0:10:22](https://youtu.be/0eUfu5Wrh5E?t=622) if we didn't have ronaldo then we  
[0:10:24](https://youtu.be/0eUfu5Wrh5E?t=624) wouldn't have such a a  
[0:10:27](https://youtu.be/0eUfu5Wrh5E?t=627) a football star that people look up to  
[0:10:29](https://youtu.be/0eUfu5Wrh5E?t=629) because he doesn't have tattoos he  
[0:10:31](https://youtu.be/0eUfu5Wrh5E?t=631) doesn't drink alcohol you know he looks  
[0:10:34](https://youtu.be/0eUfu5Wrh5E?t=634) after his family and and somebody that  
[0:10:36](https://youtu.be/0eUfu5Wrh5E?t=636) is i'm not saying the best of role  
[0:10:37](https://youtu.be/0eUfu5Wrh5E?t=637) models but i'm saying he's better than  
[0:10:39](https://youtu.be/0eUfu5Wrh5E?t=639) most  
[0:10:40](https://youtu.be/0eUfu5Wrh5E?t=640) so these two things i think uh  
[0:10:43](https://youtu.be/0eUfu5Wrh5E?t=643) are very important things to reflect  
[0:10:45](https://youtu.be/0eUfu5Wrh5E?t=645) about but you you wanted to say  
[0:10:46](https://youtu.be/0eUfu5Wrh5E?t=646) something about my body and my choice i  
[0:10:48](https://youtu.be/0eUfu5Wrh5E?t=648) forget this is my body my choice no so  
[0:10:50](https://youtu.be/0eUfu5Wrh5E?t=650) we we are created by allah and we belong  
[0:10:52](https://youtu.be/0eUfu5Wrh5E?t=652) to allah simple as that yeah this again  
[0:10:53](https://youtu.be/0eUfu5Wrh5E?t=653) it's it's a matter of akida bro and  
[0:10:55](https://youtu.be/0eUfu5Wrh5E?t=655) having tawakon and allah because when  
[0:10:57](https://youtu.be/0eUfu5Wrh5E?t=657) you're aborting this child again it's a  
[0:10:59](https://youtu.be/0eUfu5Wrh5E?t=659) lack of  
[0:11:00](https://youtu.be/0eUfu5Wrh5E?t=660) because if your thinking is i can't look  
[0:11:02](https://youtu.be/0eUfu5Wrh5E?t=662) after them okay allah says in the quran  
[0:11:04](https://youtu.be/0eUfu5Wrh5E?t=664) he is the one that provides one life all  
[0:11:06](https://youtu.be/0eUfu5Wrh5E?t=666) these issues linked to tawheed and his  
[0:11:09](https://youtu.be/0eUfu5Wrh5E?t=669) mainly  
[0:11:10](https://youtu.be/0eUfu5Wrh5E?t=670) not trusting having trust in allah  
[0:11:13](https://youtu.be/0eUfu5Wrh5E?t=673) knowing that he's the creator that  
[0:11:14](https://youtu.be/0eUfu5Wrh5E?t=674) created the heavens and the earth that  
[0:11:15](https://youtu.be/0eUfu5Wrh5E?t=675) he can provide for you it's not deep  
[0:11:17](https://youtu.be/0eUfu5Wrh5E?t=677) well  
[0:11:18](https://youtu.be/0eUfu5Wrh5E?t=678) it's an insulin can you imagine the one  
[0:11:19](https://youtu.be/0eUfu5Wrh5E?t=679) who created the heavens do you believe  
[0:11:20](https://youtu.be/0eUfu5Wrh5E?t=680) in him yeah i do but do you believe it  
[0:11:22](https://youtu.be/0eUfu5Wrh5E?t=682) can provide for you uh what an insult  
[0:11:24](https://youtu.be/0eUfu5Wrh5E?t=684) what's an insult there's there's also  
[0:11:26](https://youtu.be/0eUfu5Wrh5E?t=686) another thing that needs to be  
[0:11:28](https://youtu.be/0eUfu5Wrh5E?t=688) understood here they might say you know  
[0:11:29](https://youtu.be/0eUfu5Wrh5E?t=689) what she's just um she's just a woman  
[0:11:31](https://youtu.be/0eUfu5Wrh5E?t=691) you know leave her alone  
[0:11:35](https://youtu.be/0eUfu5Wrh5E?t=695) the thing is there's two types of  
[0:11:37](https://youtu.be/0eUfu5Wrh5E?t=697) muslims that can go on a show like that  
[0:11:38](https://youtu.be/0eUfu5Wrh5E?t=698) one without hijab that people will  
[0:11:40](https://youtu.be/0eUfu5Wrh5E?t=700) assume certain things let's face it we  
[0:11:42](https://youtu.be/0eUfu5Wrh5E?t=702) do live in a society where we judge by  
[0:11:45](https://youtu.be/0eUfu5Wrh5E?t=705) what's apparent whether it's right right  
[0:11:47](https://youtu.be/0eUfu5Wrh5E?t=707) or whether it's wrong if somebody sees a  
[0:11:49](https://youtu.be/0eUfu5Wrh5E?t=709) hijabi woman on there and they're not  
[0:11:51](https://youtu.be/0eUfu5Wrh5E?t=711) that exposed to islam they will assume  
[0:11:53](https://youtu.be/0eUfu5Wrh5E?t=713) that that is the orthodox opinion of  
[0:11:56](https://youtu.be/0eUfu5Wrh5E?t=716) islam so you're saying that there is a  
[0:11:58](https://youtu.be/0eUfu5Wrh5E?t=718) cut of age and you're saying three  
[0:11:59](https://youtu.be/0eUfu5Wrh5E?t=719) months now you could argue maybe she  
[0:12:01](https://youtu.be/0eUfu5Wrh5E?t=721) knew that maybe she didn't know that  
[0:12:03](https://youtu.be/0eUfu5Wrh5E?t=723) four months but with all due respect  
[0:12:05](https://youtu.be/0eUfu5Wrh5E?t=725) like if she didn't know that and she  
[0:12:06](https://youtu.be/0eUfu5Wrh5E?t=726) knows she's the only hijabi on that show  
[0:12:08](https://youtu.be/0eUfu5Wrh5E?t=728) it's a big channel she has a  
[0:12:10](https://youtu.be/0eUfu5Wrh5E?t=730) responsibility to say and represent her  
[0:12:13](https://youtu.be/0eUfu5Wrh5E?t=733) religion because she's wearing the  
[0:12:14](https://youtu.be/0eUfu5Wrh5E?t=734) attire if you're wearing the attire of a  
[0:12:16](https://youtu.be/0eUfu5Wrh5E?t=736) policewoman and then somebody asks you  
[0:12:18](https://youtu.be/0eUfu5Wrh5E?t=738) law and you get the law wrong you can't  
[0:12:20](https://youtu.be/0eUfu5Wrh5E?t=740) say hey don't judge me by the way i look  
[0:12:22](https://youtu.be/0eUfu5Wrh5E?t=742) so she's she is responsible and she does  
[0:12:25](https://youtu.be/0eUfu5Wrh5E?t=745) need to be sensible about these things  
[0:12:27](https://youtu.be/0eUfu5Wrh5E?t=747) even if you make the argument that maybe  
[0:12:29](https://youtu.be/0eUfu5Wrh5E?t=749) it was cut out maybe this may be that  
[0:12:30](https://youtu.be/0eUfu5Wrh5E?t=750) she should you know ensure that her  
[0:12:32](https://youtu.be/0eUfu5Wrh5E?t=752) religion is represented well i think  
[0:12:35](https://youtu.be/0eUfu5Wrh5E?t=755) with her the thing is what is most  
[0:12:37](https://youtu.be/0eUfu5Wrh5E?t=757) despicable  
[0:12:38](https://youtu.be/0eUfu5Wrh5E?t=758) about her  
[0:12:40](https://youtu.be/0eUfu5Wrh5E?t=760) kind of  
[0:12:41](https://youtu.be/0eUfu5Wrh5E?t=761) portrayal of islam or lack thereof  
[0:12:43](https://youtu.be/0eUfu5Wrh5E?t=763) actually to be honest with you is the  
[0:12:45](https://youtu.be/0eUfu5Wrh5E?t=765) fact that she's being so inconsistent  
[0:12:47](https://youtu.be/0eUfu5Wrh5E?t=767) with her worldview  
[0:12:49](https://youtu.be/0eUfu5Wrh5E?t=769) look she's representing islam through  
[0:12:51](https://youtu.be/0eUfu5Wrh5E?t=771) her attire like you've mentioned  
[0:12:53](https://youtu.be/0eUfu5Wrh5E?t=773) and she's meant to represent a muslim  
[0:12:55](https://youtu.be/0eUfu5Wrh5E?t=775) voice on the show yeah she all she's  
[0:12:58](https://youtu.be/0eUfu5Wrh5E?t=778) doing is spouting left-wing propaganda  
[0:13:01](https://youtu.be/0eUfu5Wrh5E?t=781) second word feminism  
[0:13:02](https://youtu.be/0eUfu5Wrh5E?t=782) this is not a representation of what  
[0:13:04](https://youtu.be/0eUfu5Wrh5E?t=784) muslims believe and she's not  
[0:13:06](https://youtu.be/0eUfu5Wrh5E?t=786) self-consistent with islam she's trying  
[0:13:08](https://youtu.be/0eUfu5Wrh5E?t=788) to bring two opposing ideologies  
[0:13:10](https://youtu.be/0eUfu5Wrh5E?t=790) together second wave feminism and islam  
[0:13:13](https://youtu.be/0eUfu5Wrh5E?t=793) and it's just looking wrong first of all  
[0:13:15](https://youtu.be/0eUfu5Wrh5E?t=795) i want to i want to show one thing okay  
[0:13:17](https://youtu.be/0eUfu5Wrh5E?t=797) they asked a question which is  
[0:13:19](https://youtu.be/0eUfu5Wrh5E?t=799) that do they believe that the world  
[0:13:21](https://youtu.be/0eUfu5Wrh5E?t=801) would be a better place if it's run by  
[0:13:22](https://youtu.be/0eUfu5Wrh5E?t=802) women yeah  
[0:13:23](https://youtu.be/0eUfu5Wrh5E?t=803) and look where she stands on the on  
[0:13:25](https://youtu.be/0eUfu5Wrh5E?t=805) there she doesn't have a strong stance  
[0:13:27](https://youtu.be/0eUfu5Wrh5E?t=807) but look where she stands as well but  
[0:13:29](https://youtu.be/0eUfu5Wrh5E?t=809) then look at the contribution i want to  
[0:13:31](https://youtu.be/0eUfu5Wrh5E?t=811) focus on the contribution of the white  
[0:13:33](https://youtu.be/0eUfu5Wrh5E?t=813) feminists white feminists because i  
[0:13:35](https://youtu.be/0eUfu5Wrh5E?t=815) actually think it was a very good  
[0:13:37](https://youtu.be/0eUfu5Wrh5E?t=817) contribution from within her own  
[0:13:38](https://youtu.be/0eUfu5Wrh5E?t=818) paradigm  
[0:13:40](https://youtu.be/0eUfu5Wrh5E?t=820) how is that any different than saying i  
[0:13:41](https://youtu.be/0eUfu5Wrh5E?t=821) believe that the world would be better  
[0:13:43](https://youtu.be/0eUfu5Wrh5E?t=823) if it were run by men like if we're  
[0:13:45](https://youtu.be/0eUfu5Wrh5E?t=825) going to say that on this token we get  
[0:13:46](https://youtu.be/0eUfu5Wrh5E?t=826) that on that token that's not even  
[0:13:48](https://youtu.be/0eUfu5Wrh5E?t=828) balanced at all now if you compare that  
[0:13:50](https://youtu.be/0eUfu5Wrh5E?t=830) with the muslims contribution okay  
[0:13:53](https://youtu.be/0eUfu5Wrh5E?t=833) let's see what the muslim has to say and  
[0:13:54](https://youtu.be/0eUfu5Wrh5E?t=834) then and then comment on all of it  
[0:13:56](https://youtu.be/0eUfu5Wrh5E?t=836) that's why i chose this one too because  
[0:13:58](https://youtu.be/0eUfu5Wrh5E?t=838) i don't think it should be one or the  
[0:13:59](https://youtu.be/0eUfu5Wrh5E?t=839) other i definitely think that  
[0:14:01](https://youtu.be/0eUfu5Wrh5E?t=841) when it's only man run they're missing  
[0:14:03](https://youtu.be/0eUfu5Wrh5E?t=843) the rest of society you can't really  
[0:14:05](https://youtu.be/0eUfu5Wrh5E?t=845) operate the world or any government or  
[0:14:07](https://youtu.be/0eUfu5Wrh5E?t=847) leadership if you're not embracing the  
[0:14:09](https://youtu.be/0eUfu5Wrh5E?t=849) second half of society so  
[0:14:11](https://youtu.be/0eUfu5Wrh5E?t=851) for me looking at the white feminist  
[0:14:13](https://youtu.be/0eUfu5Wrh5E?t=853) she to be honest is way more  
[0:14:15](https://youtu.be/0eUfu5Wrh5E?t=855) self-consistent with her ideology than  
[0:14:17](https://youtu.be/0eUfu5Wrh5E?t=857) the muslim who's attempting to be a  
[0:14:19](https://youtu.be/0eUfu5Wrh5E?t=859) feminist who really is uh who's  
[0:14:22](https://youtu.be/0eUfu5Wrh5E?t=862) sacrificing her religion is  
[0:14:23](https://youtu.be/0eUfu5Wrh5E?t=863) contradictory in her stances because  
[0:14:26](https://youtu.be/0eUfu5Wrh5E?t=866) this woman at least she's  
[0:14:27](https://youtu.be/0eUfu5Wrh5E?t=867) self-consistent she realizes that  
[0:14:29](https://youtu.be/0eUfu5Wrh5E?t=869) actually if feminism is an egalitarian  
[0:14:31](https://youtu.be/0eUfu5Wrh5E?t=871) discourse especially if it's liberal  
[0:14:32](https://youtu.be/0eUfu5Wrh5E?t=872) feminism  
[0:14:33](https://youtu.be/0eUfu5Wrh5E?t=873) then it shouldn't ensure that people  
[0:14:35](https://youtu.be/0eUfu5Wrh5E?t=875) have freedom of choice  
[0:14:37](https://youtu.be/0eUfu5Wrh5E?t=877) and and she and also freedom and equal  
[0:14:40](https://youtu.be/0eUfu5Wrh5E?t=880) opportunities and she starts to realize  
[0:14:42](https://youtu.be/0eUfu5Wrh5E?t=882) okay this is how it should play out if  
[0:14:44](https://youtu.be/0eUfu5Wrh5E?t=884) we are to be self-consistent the muslim  
[0:14:47](https://youtu.be/0eUfu5Wrh5E?t=887) she has no care to try and represent uh  
[0:14:49](https://youtu.be/0eUfu5Wrh5E?t=889) consistency or be consistent in any way  
[0:14:52](https://youtu.be/0eUfu5Wrh5E?t=892) so she's just saying yeah it would  
[0:14:53](https://youtu.be/0eUfu5Wrh5E?t=893) actually be better if it's run by women  
[0:14:55](https://youtu.be/0eUfu5Wrh5E?t=895) but the problem is of course that islam  
[0:14:57](https://youtu.be/0eUfu5Wrh5E?t=897) gives rights to men that it doesn't give  
[0:14:59](https://youtu.be/0eUfu5Wrh5E?t=899) to women it gives responsibilities as  
[0:15:00](https://youtu.be/0eUfu5Wrh5E?t=900) well to men that it does not give to  
[0:15:01](https://youtu.be/0eUfu5Wrh5E?t=901) women  
[0:15:02](https://youtu.be/0eUfu5Wrh5E?t=902) um  
[0:15:03](https://youtu.be/0eUfu5Wrh5E?t=903) not least of course the fact that the  
[0:15:04](https://youtu.be/0eUfu5Wrh5E?t=904) man is meant to be the manager of the  
[0:15:06](https://youtu.be/0eUfu5Wrh5E?t=906) household  
[0:15:11](https://youtu.be/0eUfu5Wrh5E?t=911) that men are is and protectors of women  
[0:15:12](https://youtu.be/0eUfu5Wrh5E?t=912) but because of what he gave one over the  
[0:15:14](https://youtu.be/0eUfu5Wrh5E?t=914) other  
[0:15:15](https://youtu.be/0eUfu5Wrh5E?t=915) and the word  
[0:15:16](https://youtu.be/0eUfu5Wrh5E?t=916) which is obedience you know for men to  
[0:15:19](https://youtu.be/0eUfu5Wrh5E?t=919) women women to men in the in the  
[0:15:21](https://youtu.be/0eUfu5Wrh5E?t=921) household is not something which is just  
[0:15:23](https://youtu.be/0eUfu5Wrh5E?t=923) relegated to the hadith literature it's  
[0:15:25](https://youtu.be/0eUfu5Wrh5E?t=925) actually in 434 itself  
[0:15:27](https://youtu.be/0eUfu5Wrh5E?t=927) in the quran itself  
[0:15:32](https://youtu.be/0eUfu5Wrh5E?t=932) if they obey you meaning this is the  
[0:15:34](https://youtu.be/0eUfu5Wrh5E?t=934) normative state  
[0:15:36](https://youtu.be/0eUfu5Wrh5E?t=936) the point is  
[0:15:37](https://youtu.be/0eUfu5Wrh5E?t=937) if you're saying that the world will be  
[0:15:38](https://youtu.be/0eUfu5Wrh5E?t=938) better run by women what is your stance  
[0:15:41](https://youtu.be/0eUfu5Wrh5E?t=941) on men being leaders of every household  
[0:15:44](https://youtu.be/0eUfu5Wrh5E?t=944) because  
[0:15:45](https://youtu.be/0eUfu5Wrh5E?t=945) men being lead on an aggregate level  
[0:15:47](https://youtu.be/0eUfu5Wrh5E?t=947) this would mean  
[0:15:48](https://youtu.be/0eUfu5Wrh5E?t=948) that what you want is an inverse of  
[0:15:50](https://youtu.be/0eUfu5Wrh5E?t=950) what's going on which is completely  
[0:15:51](https://youtu.be/0eUfu5Wrh5E?t=951) anti-islamic what do you guys think i  
[0:15:54](https://youtu.be/0eUfu5Wrh5E?t=954) think the  
[0:15:55](https://youtu.be/0eUfu5Wrh5E?t=955) an interesting parallel you can draw is  
[0:15:57](https://youtu.be/0eUfu5Wrh5E?t=957) with regards to approximately 124 000  
[0:16:00](https://youtu.be/0eUfu5Wrh5E?t=960) prophets that have come and all of them  
[0:16:01](https://youtu.be/0eUfu5Wrh5E?t=961) being male and leaders leaders of the  
[0:16:04](https://youtu.be/0eUfu5Wrh5E?t=964) religion exactly imams the leaders of uh  
[0:16:07](https://youtu.be/0eUfu5Wrh5E?t=967) every single congregational prayer  
[0:16:09](https://youtu.be/0eUfu5Wrh5E?t=969) that's valid within the paradigm of  
[0:16:10](https://youtu.be/0eUfu5Wrh5E?t=970) islam being a male figure what would be  
[0:16:13](https://youtu.be/0eUfu5Wrh5E?t=973) your answer with regards to that so it  
[0:16:15](https://youtu.be/0eUfu5Wrh5E?t=975) does seem contradictory to an islamic  
[0:16:18](https://youtu.be/0eUfu5Wrh5E?t=978) point of view i think she could have  
[0:16:20](https://youtu.be/0eUfu5Wrh5E?t=980) worded it better well alan if she  
[0:16:22](https://youtu.be/0eUfu5Wrh5E?t=982) actually meant this  
[0:16:23](https://youtu.be/0eUfu5Wrh5E?t=983) but it doesn't seem like she's somebody  
[0:16:26](https://youtu.be/0eUfu5Wrh5E?t=986) that is  
[0:16:28](https://youtu.be/0eUfu5Wrh5E?t=988) committed but i mean representative of  
[0:16:30](https://youtu.be/0eUfu5Wrh5E?t=990) orthodox islam of course not the thing  
[0:16:32](https://youtu.be/0eUfu5Wrh5E?t=992) is  
[0:16:34](https://youtu.be/0eUfu5Wrh5E?t=994) to be quite honest with you she's sold  
[0:16:36](https://youtu.be/0eUfu5Wrh5E?t=996) her soul to the left-wing ideologies and  
[0:16:39](https://youtu.be/0eUfu5Wrh5E?t=999) for all intents and purposes this could  
[0:16:41](https://youtu.be/0eUfu5Wrh5E?t=1001) lead to major coffer  
[0:16:44](https://youtu.be/0eUfu5Wrh5E?t=1004) that takes someone out of the fold of  
[0:16:45](https://youtu.be/0eUfu5Wrh5E?t=1005) islam and we have to just call the spare  
[0:16:47](https://youtu.be/0eUfu5Wrh5E?t=1007) the spirit i'm not calling her kafer  
[0:16:49](https://youtu.be/0eUfu5Wrh5E?t=1009) although what she's what she's  
[0:16:50](https://youtu.be/0eUfu5Wrh5E?t=1010) representing is kofor akbar a major  
[0:16:52](https://youtu.be/0eUfu5Wrh5E?t=1012) coffee and most of the positions of the  
[0:16:54](https://youtu.be/0eUfu5Wrh5E?t=1014) implied intelligence of her position  
[0:16:57](https://youtu.be/0eUfu5Wrh5E?t=1017) what we need to realize is that these  
[0:16:59](https://youtu.be/0eUfu5Wrh5E?t=1019) positions are unacceptable islamically  
[0:17:01](https://youtu.be/0eUfu5Wrh5E?t=1021) that's as simple as really as simple as  
[0:17:03](https://youtu.be/0eUfu5Wrh5E?t=1023) that these positions are unacceptable  
[0:17:05](https://youtu.be/0eUfu5Wrh5E?t=1025) islamically you need to realize that  
[0:17:07](https://youtu.be/0eUfu5Wrh5E?t=1027) this is another it's another way of life  
[0:17:10](https://youtu.be/0eUfu5Wrh5E?t=1030) it's another ideology you can call it if  
[0:17:12](https://youtu.be/0eUfu5Wrh5E?t=1032) you like another religion yes second  
[0:17:14](https://youtu.be/0eUfu5Wrh5E?t=1034) word feminism is like another religion  
[0:17:16](https://youtu.be/0eUfu5Wrh5E?t=1036) that has different presuppositions  
[0:17:18](https://youtu.be/0eUfu5Wrh5E?t=1038) different assumptions different  
[0:17:19](https://youtu.be/0eUfu5Wrh5E?t=1039) hierarchies different priorities you  
[0:17:21](https://youtu.be/0eUfu5Wrh5E?t=1041) cannot maintain an islamic committed  
[0:17:24](https://youtu.be/0eUfu5Wrh5E?t=1044) islamic  
[0:17:25](https://youtu.be/0eUfu5Wrh5E?t=1045) point of view and this at the same time  
[0:17:27](https://youtu.be/0eUfu5Wrh5E?t=1047) you will be cognitively dissonant which  
[0:17:30](https://youtu.be/0eUfu5Wrh5E?t=1050) is a psychological disorder or you'll be  
[0:17:32](https://youtu.be/0eUfu5Wrh5E?t=1052) a liar to yourself and to others around  
[0:17:34](https://youtu.be/0eUfu5Wrh5E?t=1054) you or you'll be a clandestine apostate  
[0:17:37](https://youtu.be/0eUfu5Wrh5E?t=1057) someone who doesn't actually have money  
[0:17:40](https://youtu.be/0eUfu5Wrh5E?t=1060) someone who doesn't actually believe in  
[0:17:42](https://youtu.be/0eUfu5Wrh5E?t=1062) islam  
[0:17:43](https://youtu.be/0eUfu5Wrh5E?t=1063) but just pretends to be muslim for  
[0:17:45](https://youtu.be/0eUfu5Wrh5E?t=1065) social and cultural  
[0:17:46](https://youtu.be/0eUfu5Wrh5E?t=1066) reasons  
[0:17:47](https://youtu.be/0eUfu5Wrh5E?t=1067) and may allah protect us and our people  
[0:17:49](https://youtu.be/0eUfu5Wrh5E?t=1069) from this because at the end of the day  
[0:17:50](https://youtu.be/0eUfu5Wrh5E?t=1070) we're seeing more and more of these  
[0:17:51](https://youtu.be/0eUfu5Wrh5E?t=1071) kinds of figures come up and they're  
[0:17:53](https://youtu.be/0eUfu5Wrh5E?t=1073) trying to normalize it but there is no  
[0:17:54](https://youtu.be/0eUfu5Wrh5E?t=1074) space for that in the islamic  
[0:17:55](https://youtu.be/0eUfu5Wrh5E?t=1075) environment at all  
[0:17:57](https://youtu.be/0eUfu5Wrh5E?t=1077) would you agree yeah of course you know  
[0:17:59](https://youtu.be/0eUfu5Wrh5E?t=1079) we're happy with our religion you know  
[0:18:01](https://youtu.be/0eUfu5Wrh5E?t=1081) we're pleased with our lord you know  
[0:18:02](https://youtu.be/0eUfu5Wrh5E?t=1082) it's as simple as that man let's just  
[0:18:04](https://youtu.be/0eUfu5Wrh5E?t=1084) get away with this insecurities you know  
[0:18:06](https://youtu.be/0eUfu5Wrh5E?t=1086) at the end of the day it's as simple as  
[0:18:07](https://youtu.be/0eUfu5Wrh5E?t=1087) that but that's why that's where it  
[0:18:08](https://youtu.be/0eUfu5Wrh5E?t=1088) stems from we don't understand a lack of  
[0:18:10](https://youtu.be/0eUfu5Wrh5E?t=1090) tolhee not knowing your religion it's  
[0:18:12](https://youtu.be/0eUfu5Wrh5E?t=1092) true and the weapons is then you become  
[0:18:13](https://youtu.be/0eUfu5Wrh5E?t=1093) like a is it a leaf that you know  
[0:18:15](https://youtu.be/0eUfu5Wrh5E?t=1095) wherever the wind blows you you know  
[0:18:16](https://youtu.be/0eUfu5Wrh5E?t=1096) you're you're wherever where feminism oh  
[0:18:18](https://youtu.be/0eUfu5Wrh5E?t=1098) i'm a feminist that's what it boils down  
[0:18:20](https://youtu.be/0eUfu5Wrh5E?t=1100) to guys you know and that's where the  
[0:18:21](https://youtu.be/0eUfu5Wrh5E?t=1101) root of the problem is be proud be happy  
[0:18:24](https://youtu.be/0eUfu5Wrh5E?t=1104) you know if you see a one phenomena is  
[0:18:26](https://youtu.be/0eUfu5Wrh5E?t=1106) islam has all these regulations and laws  
[0:18:29](https://youtu.be/0eUfu5Wrh5E?t=1109) and stuff in place which is totally  
[0:18:31](https://youtu.be/0eUfu5Wrh5E?t=1111) opposing to the liberal view but  
[0:18:33](https://youtu.be/0eUfu5Wrh5E?t=1113) thousands of people come to islam  
[0:18:34](https://youtu.be/0eUfu5Wrh5E?t=1114) because the thing is when you're true to  
[0:18:36](https://youtu.be/0eUfu5Wrh5E?t=1116) yourself like if i you know once i i  
[0:18:38](https://youtu.be/0eUfu5Wrh5E?t=1118) spent three years looking into different  
[0:18:39](https://youtu.be/0eUfu5Wrh5E?t=1119) religions bro once i established islam  
[0:18:41](https://youtu.be/0eUfu5Wrh5E?t=1121) as the truth i knew i knew my dad my  
[0:18:44](https://youtu.be/0eUfu5Wrh5E?t=1124) family my society is going to shun me  
[0:18:47](https://youtu.be/0eUfu5Wrh5E?t=1127) yeah bro if i had if i the last thing i  
[0:18:49](https://youtu.be/0eUfu5Wrh5E?t=1129) should have done was accept islam the  
[0:18:51](https://youtu.be/0eUfu5Wrh5E?t=1131) last thing i should done but it's the  
[0:18:52](https://youtu.be/0eUfu5Wrh5E?t=1132) truth bro i can't lie to myself and if  
[0:18:54](https://youtu.be/0eUfu5Wrh5E?t=1134) it's the truth i have to stand by it and  
[0:18:56](https://youtu.be/0eUfu5Wrh5E?t=1136) when i say i i i this is from allah i'm  
[0:18:58](https://youtu.be/0eUfu5Wrh5E?t=1138) not saying i do something personal it's  
[0:19:00](https://youtu.be/0eUfu5Wrh5E?t=1140) with allah's guidance but what i'm  
[0:19:01](https://youtu.be/0eUfu5Wrh5E?t=1141) saying is man be  
[0:19:03](https://youtu.be/0eUfu5Wrh5E?t=1143) proud of your religion man is it damn  
[0:19:04](https://youtu.be/0eUfu5Wrh5E?t=1144) hard you're there trying to be an  
[0:19:06](https://youtu.be/0eUfu5Wrh5E?t=1146) advocate for feminism and they're  
[0:19:07](https://youtu.be/0eUfu5Wrh5E?t=1147) rejecting him and they're throwing you  
[0:19:08](https://youtu.be/0eUfu5Wrh5E?t=1148) that woman came and just you know  
[0:19:09](https://youtu.be/0eUfu5Wrh5E?t=1149) dismissed you you know be firm with your  
[0:19:12](https://youtu.be/0eUfu5Wrh5E?t=1152) religion have tawakkul and allah trust  
[0:19:14](https://youtu.be/0eUfu5Wrh5E?t=1154) in allah build that connection with him  
[0:19:16](https://youtu.be/0eUfu5Wrh5E?t=1156) you don't need feminism and all the  
[0:19:17](https://youtu.be/0eUfu5Wrh5E?t=1157) schisms that's what i would say  
[0:19:18](https://youtu.be/0eUfu5Wrh5E?t=1158) absolutely bro anything you want to say  
[0:19:19](https://youtu.be/0eUfu5Wrh5E?t=1159) is your channel that well  
[0:19:27](https://youtu.be/0eUfu5Wrh5E?t=1167) [Music]  
[0:19:32](https://youtu.be/0eUfu5Wrh5E?t=1172) [Laughter]  
[0:19:35](https://youtu.be/0eUfu5Wrh5E?t=1175) just one small thought comes to mind  
[0:19:37](https://youtu.be/0eUfu5Wrh5E?t=1177) which is what a scholar said that back  
[0:19:38](https://youtu.be/0eUfu5Wrh5E?t=1178) in the days we had masjids  
[0:19:41](https://youtu.be/0eUfu5Wrh5E?t=1181) the mosques  
[0:19:42](https://youtu.be/0eUfu5Wrh5E?t=1182) that were unbaked they were made from  
[0:19:44](https://youtu.be/0eUfu5Wrh5E?t=1184) unbaked clay  
[0:19:45](https://youtu.be/0eUfu5Wrh5E?t=1185) yeah but the people that emerged from  
[0:19:47](https://youtu.be/0eUfu5Wrh5E?t=1187) them was gonna be a good one take a step  
[0:19:49](https://youtu.be/0eUfu5Wrh5E?t=1189) back  
[0:19:50](https://youtu.be/0eUfu5Wrh5E?t=1190) they were baked but today the masjids  
[0:19:53](https://youtu.be/0eUfu5Wrh5E?t=1193) are baked but the people that emerge  
[0:19:55](https://youtu.be/0eUfu5Wrh5E?t=1195) from the masjids are unbaked  
[0:19:58](https://youtu.be/0eUfu5Wrh5E?t=1198) so i mean we although we we have stepped  
[0:20:00](https://youtu.be/0eUfu5Wrh5E?t=1200) up we  
[0:20:02](https://youtu.be/0eUfu5Wrh5E?t=1202) although we have  
[0:20:03](https://youtu.be/0eUfu5Wrh5E?t=1203) like  
[0:20:04](https://youtu.be/0eUfu5Wrh5E?t=1204) billions 1.8 billion muslims  
[0:20:08](https://youtu.be/0eUfu5Wrh5E?t=1208) but  
[0:20:09](https://youtu.be/0eUfu5Wrh5E?t=1209) if we only had 313 with the caliber of  
[0:20:12](https://youtu.be/0eUfu5Wrh5E?t=1212) badr today we would be on a different  
[0:20:15](https://youtu.be/0eUfu5Wrh5E?t=1215) plane exactly so we need to take a leaf  
[0:20:17](https://youtu.be/0eUfu5Wrh5E?t=1217) from these muslims read the seerah the  
[0:20:20](https://youtu.be/0eUfu5Wrh5E?t=1220) history and and and go and take the  
[0:20:23](https://youtu.be/0eUfu5Wrh5E?t=1223) positives from that time and one of the  
[0:20:26](https://youtu.be/0eUfu5Wrh5E?t=1226) positives that we've highlighted is  
[0:20:27](https://youtu.be/0eUfu5Wrh5E?t=1227) being confident in your religion and  
[0:20:29](https://youtu.be/0eUfu5Wrh5E?t=1229) number two having knowledge of your  
[0:20:30](https://youtu.be/0eUfu5Wrh5E?t=1230) religion and  
[0:20:32](https://youtu.be/0eUfu5Wrh5E?t=1232) becoming people of substance and people  
[0:20:34](https://youtu.be/0eUfu5Wrh5E?t=1234) of action exactly and what you said  
[0:20:36](https://youtu.be/0eUfu5Wrh5E?t=1236) there for example that there's a hadith  
[0:20:37](https://youtu.be/0eUfu5Wrh5E?t=1237) of the process which mentions this that  
[0:20:39](https://youtu.be/0eUfu5Wrh5E?t=1239) on that day or the process tell them  
[0:20:41](https://youtu.be/0eUfu5Wrh5E?t=1241) companies you're going to be vast in  
[0:20:42](https://youtu.be/0eUfu5Wrh5E?t=1242) number you know and um  
[0:20:45](https://youtu.be/0eUfu5Wrh5E?t=1245) you're going to be like rubbish yes but  
[0:20:48](https://youtu.be/0eUfu5Wrh5E?t=1248) it's going to be like the form of the  
[0:20:48](https://youtu.be/0eUfu5Wrh5E?t=1248) siege yeah and that and why it's very  
[0:20:51](https://youtu.be/0eUfu5Wrh5E?t=1251) interesting because ends there he  
[0:20:52](https://youtu.be/0eUfu5Wrh5E?t=1252) actually says and he says why he says  
[0:20:54](https://youtu.be/0eUfu5Wrh5E?t=1254) because  
[0:20:56](https://youtu.be/0eUfu5Wrh5E?t=1256) yes it will put the love of the dunya  
[0:20:58](https://youtu.be/0eUfu5Wrh5E?t=1258) and fear of death and that's exactly why  
[0:21:00](https://youtu.be/0eUfu5Wrh5E?t=1260) would someone fear of death we all did i  
[0:21:02](https://youtu.be/0eUfu5Wrh5E?t=1262) should and help um told the process i'm  
[0:21:04](https://youtu.be/0eUfu5Wrh5E?t=1264) scared of death it's not about that it's  
[0:21:06](https://youtu.be/0eUfu5Wrh5E?t=1266) not that you don't want to meet allah  
[0:21:07](https://youtu.be/0eUfu5Wrh5E?t=1267) it's that you're attached to the dunya  
[0:21:09](https://youtu.be/0eUfu5Wrh5E?t=1269) you don't want to die because you're  
[0:21:09](https://youtu.be/0eUfu5Wrh5E?t=1269) like no i want to stay here aki if you  
[0:21:11](https://youtu.be/0eUfu5Wrh5E?t=1271) know allah promised you something better  
[0:21:13](https://youtu.be/0eUfu5Wrh5E?t=1273) we all scared of death but to at least  
[0:21:15](https://youtu.be/0eUfu5Wrh5E?t=1275) be firm and be like you know  
[0:21:17](https://youtu.be/0eUfu5Wrh5E?t=1277) it is going to be happy but you've  
[0:21:18](https://youtu.be/0eUfu5Wrh5E?t=1278) attached yourself to the dunya so much  
[0:21:20](https://youtu.be/0eUfu5Wrh5E?t=1280) and you know what it might it might have  
[0:21:21](https://youtu.be/0eUfu5Wrh5E?t=1281) been death in those days but nowadays it  
[0:21:23](https://youtu.be/0eUfu5Wrh5E?t=1283) might be death socially you're afraid of  
[0:21:26](https://youtu.be/0eUfu5Wrh5E?t=1286) of dying socially  
[0:21:28](https://youtu.be/0eUfu5Wrh5E?t=1288) your soul your  
[0:21:47](https://youtu.be/0eUfu5Wrh5E?t=1307) and it will come back to being strange
