 discusses contradictions in feminism, specifically focusing on Malaysia's current situation where there is a lack of balance in rights and equality between men and women. It also touches on the issue of maternity leave, which is currently not required in Malaysia but is in England where it is discriminatory. Finally, the speaker discusses the Islamic concept of an all-powerful, all-knowing, and all-wise god, which has exceptions that apply in specific cases.

**<a onclick="modifyYTiframeseektime('0')">00:00:00</a>** This lecture discusses feminist contradictions in Malaysia, focusing on traditionalist and second-wave assumptions about women and sex. It addresses the problem of dependency, as well as the difference between equity and equality between men and women. Finally, it describes intersectional feminism, which is important for Muslims to understand and use to their advantage.
* **<a onclick="modifyYTiframeseektime('300')">00:05:00</a>** Second-wave feminists argue that there are biological and anatomical differences between men and women, but ultimately believe that there should be equality between the sexes. Islamic discourse, on the other hand, believes that there should be an equality between men and women in front of the law, with certain exceptions.
* **<a onclick="modifyYTiframeseektime('600')">00:10:00</a>**  Simone de Beauvoir discusses the inconsistencies between feminism and the idea of equality. She argues that despite physical differences between men and women, there should be equality between the genders. She gives three examples of how this inconsistency can be problematic, including the idea of transgendered athletes.
* **<a onclick="modifyYTiframeseektime('900')">00:15:00</a>** This feminist argues that, in some cases, feminists want equality of opportunity, but also want equal outcomes, or "equality of outcome." She equates this with "selective invocation," or using arguments selectively to support a particular viewpoint.

The feminist points out that, in some cases, feminists want segregation in sports, in order to give advantage to certain groups, but they also want equality of opportunity. She argues that this isn't consistent, and that feminists need to be more consistent in their positions. She also points out that, in war, there is a higher risk of death and injury, and that feminists should be fighting for equality in all spheres, not just in sports.
* **<a onclick="modifyYTiframeseektime('1200')">00:20:00</a>**  feminist contradictions are addressed. First, the history of male dominance in the military is discussed. Then, feminism's first principles are discussed, and examples of inconsistencies within the movement are given. Intersectional feminism is introduced, and its negative effects on second-wave feminism are highlighted. Finally, the history of colonization in Malaysia is discussed.
* **<a onclick="modifyYTiframeseektime('1500')">00:25:00</a>** This lecture discusses how early feminism was divided into "stands" based on how important various aspects of women's lives were to them. One stand, "intersectional feminism," considers not only gender, but also race, class, and sexuality. This perspective has the potential to help women see their lives from a more holistic perspective, and it is often met with resistance from those who prioritize only gender-based issues.
* **<a onclick="modifyYTiframeseektime('1800')">00:30:00</a>* Discusses contradictions between feminist understandings of gender, Eurocentric understandings of gender, and Islamic understandings of gender. She says that if feminism is true, then it should allow women to consent to be in a patriarchal structure, where their decisions are hidden from male eyes. She argues that obedience is severely curtailed in Islamic households, and that this leaves the woman with much stress.
* **<a onclick="modifyYTiframeseektime('2100')">00:35:00</a>* Discusses feminist contradictions in Malaysia, specifically highlighting the idea that women should be paid for their role as "wrighters of the family," as well as the problem of gridlock that would result from having equal decision-making power within a relationship.
* **<a onclick="modifyYTiframeseektime('2400')">00:40:00</a>* Discusses contradictions in feminism, specifically focusing on Malaysia's current situation where there is a lack of balance in rights and equality between men and women. It also touches on the issue of maternity leave, which is currently not required in Malaysia but is in England where it is discriminatory. Finally, the speaker discusses the Islamic concept of an all-powerful, all-knowing, and all-wise god, which has exceptions that apply in specific cases.
* **<a onclick="modifyYTiframeseektime('2700')">00:45:00</a>* Discusses feminism and contradictions. He points out that, despite the efforts of some feminists, there are still many differences between men and women, and that some feminists consider these differences to be advantages. He advises readers to make a decision about whether they want to submit to the law or not and to escape the "sessional" form of feminism.

<a onclick="modifyYTiframeseektime('110')">0:01:50</a> reach a place of comfort and really try  
<a onclick="modifyYTiframeseektime('114')">0:01:54</a> as much as possible to make sure  
<a onclick="modifyYTiframeseektime('129')">0:02:09</a> earlier today in politics in history  
<a onclick="modifyYTiframeseektime('168')">0:02:48</a> which is currently doing research  
<a onclick="modifyYTiframeseektime('185')">0:03:05</a> University while it gets so the question  
<a onclick="modifyYTiframeseektime('218')">0:03:38</a> on equality or equity and whether one  
<a onclick="modifyYTiframeseektime('223')">0:03:43</a> intell's the other that's the crux of  
<a onclick="modifyYTiframeseektime('225')">0:03:45</a> the question is fresh in relation to  
<a onclick="modifyYTiframeseektime('227')">0:03:47</a> gender or sex or both and will come to  
<a onclick="modifyYTiframeseektime('231')">0:03:51</a> describing the sanctions between those  
<a onclick="modifyYTiframeseektime('234')">0:03:54</a> categories if there are this legs are  
<a onclick="modifyYTiframeseektime('237')">0:03:57</a> going to be divided into three different  
<a onclick="modifyYTiframeseektime('238')">0:03:58</a> parts inshallah the first part is going  
<a onclick="modifyYTiframeseektime('243')">0:04:03</a> to be an examination of the first  
<a onclick="modifyYTiframeseektime('246')">0:04:06</a> principles of feminism and of  
<a onclick="modifyYTiframeseektime('250')">0:04:10</a> traditionalist Islam the second part of  
<a onclick="modifyYTiframeseektime('254')">0:04:14</a> the  
<a onclick="modifyYTiframeseektime('254')">0:04:14</a> lecture will be what I deem our  
<a onclick="modifyYTiframeseektime('258')">0:04:18</a> inconsistencies in the application of  
<a onclick="modifyYTiframeseektime('262')">0:04:22</a> those first principles and the third  
<a onclick="modifyYTiframeseektime('265')">0:04:25</a> part of this lecture will be talking  
<a onclick="modifyYTiframeseektime('268')">0:04:28</a> about what's referred to as  
<a onclick="modifyYTiframeseektime('269')">0:04:29</a> intersectional feminism and that's going  
<a onclick="modifyYTiframeseektime('272')">0:04:32</a> to be an important part of this lecture  
<a onclick="modifyYTiframeseektime('274')">0:04:34</a> and it's important for the Muslim  
<a onclick="modifyYTiframeseektime('275')">0:04:35</a> community to know what that means  
<a onclick="modifyYTiframeseektime('277')">0:04:37</a> and how it can be effective both for us  
<a onclick="modifyYTiframeseektime('282')">0:04:42</a> and how it's contradictory in many ways  
<a onclick="modifyYTiframeseektime('287')">0:04:47</a> as well so to draw kind of like um a  
<a onclick="modifyYTiframeseektime('292')">0:04:52</a> generic sketch of what second wave in  
<a onclick="modifyYTiframeseektime('297')">0:04:57</a> particular second wave feminist  
<a onclick="modifyYTiframeseektime('298')">0:04:58</a> assumptions Intel and I've made this  
<a onclick="modifyYTiframeseektime('302')">0:05:02</a> point before and many other lectures the  
<a onclick="modifyYTiframeseektime('305')">0:05:05</a> idea is that there are biological and  
<a onclick="modifyYTiframeseektime('309')">0:05:09</a> anatomical differences between men and  
<a onclick="modifyYTiframeseektime('312')">0:05:12</a> women but despite those differences a  
<a onclick="modifyYTiframeseektime('314')">0:05:14</a> second where feminists would argue like  
<a onclick="modifyYTiframeseektime('316')">0:05:16</a> Simone de Beauvoir famously argued there  
<a onclick="modifyYTiframeseektime('318')">0:05:18</a> should be equality of opportunity this  
<a onclick="modifyYTiframeseektime('321')">0:05:21</a> is the presupposition now before I start  
<a onclick="modifyYTiframeseektime('326')">0:05:26</a> talking about this in more depth it's  
<a onclick="modifyYTiframeseektime('328')">0:05:28</a> important to note that feminism and  
<a onclick="modifyYTiframeseektime('330')">0:05:30</a> women's rights are not interchangeable  
<a onclick="modifyYTiframeseektime('332')">0:05:32</a> terms feminism is a political ideology  
<a onclick="modifyYTiframeseektime('336')">0:05:36</a> which most of which has has its writings  
<a onclick="modifyYTiframeseektime('341')">0:05:41</a> based in the Western Hemisphere  
<a onclick="modifyYTiframeseektime('344')">0:05:44</a> some say it's divided into three waves  
<a onclick="modifyYTiframeseektime('347')">0:05:47</a> and it has its own conceptions of  
<a onclick="modifyYTiframeseektime('351')">0:05:51</a> women's rights it does not have a  
<a onclick="modifyYTiframeseektime('354')">0:05:54</a> monopoly of that so you can have a non  
<a onclick="modifyYTiframeseektime('357')">0:05:57</a> feminist understanding of women's rights  
<a onclick="modifyYTiframeseektime('361')">0:06:01</a> and that's a possibility because to  
<a onclick="modifyYTiframeseektime('365')">0:06:05</a> argue otherwise we'll be arguing  
<a onclick="modifyYTiframeseektime('366')">0:06:06</a> actually in a circle or we had circular  
<a onclick="modifyYTiframeseektime('368')">0:06:08</a> argument so  
<a onclick="modifyYTiframeseektime('372')">0:06:12</a> when we say as Muslims that there are  
<a onclick="modifyYTiframeseektime('375')">0:06:15</a> tensions and contradictions and this  
<a onclick="modifyYTiframeseektime('377')">0:06:17</a> will this is definitely something we're  
<a onclick="modifyYTiframeseektime('379')">0:06:19</a> going to put forward today between  
<a onclick="modifyYTiframeseektime('380')">0:06:20</a> especially second-wave feminists ik  
<a onclick="modifyYTiframeseektime('382')">0:06:22</a> discourse and traditionalists Islamic  
<a onclick="modifyYTiframeseektime('385')">0:06:25</a> discourse this is an important note to  
<a onclick="modifyYTiframeseektime('390')">0:06:30</a> make that we are not saying that from a  
<a onclick="modifyYTiframeseektime('393')">0:06:33</a> traditional Islamic perspective from our  
<a onclick="modifyYTiframeseektime('395')">0:06:35</a> perspective as Muslims we're against  
<a onclick="modifyYTiframeseektime('397')">0:06:37</a> women's rights we cannot say this  
<a onclick="modifyYTiframeseektime('400')">0:06:40</a> because the Quran is very clear about  
<a onclick="modifyYTiframeseektime('403')">0:06:43</a> the fact that women's rights is a  
<a onclick="modifyYTiframeseektime('405')">0:06:45</a> project it's something that Muslims must  
<a onclick="modifyYTiframeseektime('409')">0:06:49</a> adhere to just like men's rights just  
<a onclick="modifyYTiframeseektime('415')">0:06:55</a> like the deity's rights allows rights  
<a onclick="modifyYTiframeseektime('417')">0:06:57</a> animal rights and so on and so a Muslim  
<a onclick="modifyYTiframeseektime('423')">0:07:03</a> cannot say we're against women's rights  
<a onclick="modifyYTiframeseektime('424')">0:07:04</a> this is actually counter textual it goes  
<a onclick="modifyYTiframeseektime('428')">0:07:08</a> against the sacred Texas this the sacred  
<a onclick="modifyYTiframeseektime('431')">0:07:11</a> texts for example where lots of Hanna  
<a onclick="modifyYTiframeseektime('435')">0:07:15</a> harlots is no Quran in the law halay of  
<a onclick="modifyYTiframeseektime('436')">0:07:16</a> the emblem and I mean come in Becker in  
<a onclick="modifyYTiframeseektime('439')">0:07:19</a> alpha Bob local min Bob that certainly  
<a onclick="modifyYTiframeseektime('442')">0:07:22</a> Allah does not let to waste any deed of  
<a onclick="modifyYTiframeseektime('447')">0:07:27</a> those who does good from you whether  
<a onclick="modifyYTiframeseektime('451')">0:07:31</a> you're a man or a woman and both of you  
<a onclick="modifyYTiframeseektime('454')">0:07:34</a> are from each other in other words there  
<a onclick="modifyYTiframeseektime('459')">0:07:39</a> is an equality in spiritual opportunity  
<a onclick="modifyYTiframeseektime('462')">0:07:42</a> between men and women and Islam and  
<a onclick="modifyYTiframeseektime('465')">0:07:45</a> there even is a general equality in  
<a onclick="modifyYTiframeseektime('468')">0:07:48</a> front of the law because the Prophet  
<a onclick="modifyYTiframeseektime('471')">0:07:51</a> Muhammad sallallaahu arias alum he says  
<a onclick="modifyYTiframeseektime('472')">0:07:52</a> in them and he said was a higher court  
<a onclick="modifyYTiframeseektime('474')">0:07:54</a> region and he said this in the context  
<a onclick="modifyYTiframeseektime('477')">0:07:57</a> where a woman was doing the prophets  
<a onclick="modifyYTiframeseektime('479')">0:07:59</a> wife was doing with law and she asked is  
<a onclick="modifyYTiframeseektime('481')">0:08:01</a> it the same for men and women so he  
<a onclick="modifyYTiframeseektime('484')">0:08:04</a> turned around he says certainly in them  
<a onclick="modifyYTiframeseektime('487')">0:08:07</a> and he sell she - agenda it's the same  
<a onclick="modifyYTiframeseektime('489')">0:08:09</a> for men and women women men and women  
<a onclick="modifyYTiframeseektime('490')">0:08:10</a> are equal in this regards meaning in  
<a onclick="modifyYTiframeseektime('493')">0:08:13</a> front of the law now this is a general  
<a onclick="modifyYTiframeseektime('496')">0:08:16</a> equality but of course the tensions will  
<a onclick="modifyYTiframeseektime('499')">0:08:19</a> arise when we say we'll hold on there  
<a onclick="modifyYTiframeseektime('501')">0:08:21</a> are exceptions  
<a onclick="modifyYTiframeseektime('503')">0:08:23</a> according to Islamic jurisprudence for  
<a onclick="modifyYTiframeseektime('506')">0:08:26</a> example what women wear is different to  
<a onclick="modifyYTiframeseektime('509')">0:08:29</a> what women what men wear there is a from  
<a onclick="modifyYTiframeseektime('513')">0:08:33</a> an Islamic perspective a justified  
<a onclick="modifyYTiframeseektime('515')">0:08:35</a> binary between men and women we should  
<a onclick="modifyYTiframeseektime('516')">0:08:36</a> start by saying that that we do believe  
<a onclick="modifyYTiframeseektime('518')">0:08:38</a> in the category of man and the category  
<a onclick="modifyYTiframeseektime('522')">0:08:42</a> of woman and that there are certain  
<a onclick="modifyYTiframeseektime('524')">0:08:44</a> regulations that apply to men that don't  
<a onclick="modifyYTiframeseektime('527')">0:08:47</a> apply to women and vice-versa  
<a onclick="modifyYTiframeseektime('529')">0:08:49</a> and those are the exception to the rule  
<a onclick="modifyYTiframeseektime('531')">0:08:51</a> of equality now if you pick up a locker  
<a onclick="modifyYTiframeseektime('537')">0:08:57</a> maybe a popular book on feminism like  
<a onclick="modifyYTiframeseektime('542')">0:09:02</a> this one when we go to in the UK a books  
<a onclick="modifyYTiframeseektime('545')">0:09:05</a> bookstore there they're almost like  
<a onclick="modifyYTiframeseektime('548')">0:09:08</a> right next to that where you're going to  
<a onclick="modifyYTiframeseektime('549')">0:09:09</a> pay the money for the book it's like  
<a onclick="modifyYTiframeseektime('551')">0:09:11</a> forcing you to buy it  
<a onclick="modifyYTiframeseektime('552')">0:09:12</a> what's this book a it's a it's a it's a  
<a onclick="modifyYTiframeseektime('555')">0:09:15</a> new popular it's not really an academic  
<a onclick="modifyYTiframeseektime('556')">0:09:16</a> work it's called the feminist manifesto  
<a onclick="modifyYTiframeseektime('559')">0:09:19</a> my Anu Ghazi she's very famous now in  
<a onclick="modifyYTiframeseektime('562')">0:09:22</a> terms of popular feminists and in the  
<a onclick="modifyYTiframeseektime('565')">0:09:25</a> front like things the first five pages  
<a onclick="modifyYTiframeseektime('567')">0:09:27</a> or something she candidly makes it clear  
<a onclick="modifyYTiframeseektime('569')">0:09:29</a> that we believe in an absolute equality  
<a onclick="modifyYTiframeseektime('572')">0:09:32</a> where there's no exception whatsoever  
<a onclick="modifyYTiframeseektime('575')">0:09:35</a> there's no exception whatsoever and I  
<a onclick="modifyYTiframeseektime('578')">0:09:38</a> think she made the exception of breast  
<a onclick="modifyYTiframeseektime('579')">0:09:39</a> milk and she talked about what breast  
<a onclick="modifyYTiframeseektime('582')">0:09:42</a> milk might be an exception but this is  
<a onclick="modifyYTiframeseektime('584')">0:09:44</a> that in the other right now this brings  
<a onclick="modifyYTiframeseektime('591')">0:09:51</a> us to our first point in examining

<a onclick="modifyYTiframeseektime('662')">0:11:02</a> what's the evidence for that why should

<a onclick="modifyYTiframeseektime('707')">0:11:47</a> principles now there are three things  
<a onclick="modifyYTiframeseektime('710')">0:11:50</a> three live examples I want to give you  
<a onclick="modifyYTiframeseektime('714')">0:11:54</a> to show you how problematic these  
<a onclick="modifyYTiframeseektime('717')">0:11:57</a> assumptions are for feminists the first  
<a onclick="modifyYTiframeseektime('720')">0:12:00</a> one relates and I'm sure many of you  
<a onclick="modifyYTiframeseektime('722')">0:12:02</a> might have been exposed to this it's a  
<a onclick="modifyYTiframeseektime('726')">0:12:06</a> big thing on the news now actually  
<a onclick="modifyYTiframeseektime('727')">0:12:07</a> that's why I'm bringing it up it's the  
<a onclick="modifyYTiframeseektime('729')">0:12:09</a> idea of transgendered sports now I'm not  
<a onclick="modifyYTiframeseektime('734')">0:12:14</a> sure if this is kind of them spill over  
<a onclick="modifyYTiframeseektime('736')">0:12:16</a> to Malaysia but this is certainly  
<a onclick="modifyYTiframeseektime('739')">0:12:19</a> something a hot topic in the West in  
<a onclick="modifyYTiframeseektime('741')">0:12:21</a> America and in the UK Western Europe the  
<a onclick="modifyYTiframeseektime('744')">0:12:24</a> question is say for instance you have  
<a onclick="modifyYTiframeseektime('747')">0:12:27</a> someone who identifies and who is  
<a onclick="modifyYTiframeseektime('750')">0:12:30</a> identified biologically as a man they do  
<a onclick="modifyYTiframeseektime('754')">0:12:34</a> a gender reassignment surgery and they  
<a onclick="modifyYTiframeseektime('757')">0:12:37</a> become self-identified as a woman okay  
<a onclick="modifyYTiframeseektime('762')">0:12:42</a> so they do a gender reassignment surgery  
<a onclick="modifyYTiframeseektime('764')">0:12:44</a> and they become self-identified as a  
<a onclick="modifyYTiframeseektime('767')">0:12:47</a> woman  
<a onclick="modifyYTiframeseektime('768')">0:12:48</a> can they participate in sports with  
<a onclick="modifyYTiframeseektime('772')">0:12:52</a> women now second wave feminists on the  
<a onclick="modifyYTiframeseektime('776')">0:12:56</a> whole seem adverse to the idea now you  
<a onclick="modifyYTiframeseektime('779')">0:12:59</a> can't make a generalization with  
<a onclick="modifyYTiframeseektime('780')">0:13:00</a> anything but big-time second wave  
<a onclick="modifyYTiframeseektime('783')">0:13:03</a> feminists like Germaine Greer who wrote  
<a onclick="modifyYTiframeseektime('785')">0:13:05</a> the book in 1971 the Female Eunuch she's  
<a onclick="modifyYTiframeseektime('788')">0:13:08</a> like one of the founding mothers of  
<a onclick="modifyYTiframeseektime('792')">0:13:12</a> feminism and she in an interview she  
<a onclick="modifyYTiframeseektime('796')">0:13:16</a> completely rejected the idea and guess  
<a onclick="modifyYTiframeseektime('799')">0:13:19</a> what she invoked she invoked anatomical  
<a onclick="modifyYTiframeseektime('803')">0:13:23</a> and biological advantage wait a minute  
<a onclick="modifyYTiframeseektime('807')">0:13:27</a> hold on now  
<a onclick="modifyYTiframeseektime('809')">0:13:29</a> hold on now let me hear the argument yes  
<a onclick="modifyYTiframeseektime('815')">0:13:35</a> so the argument goes now since the  
<a onclick="modifyYTiframeseektime('818')">0:13:38</a> person and this is a very sensible  
<a onclick="modifyYTiframeseektime('820')">0:13:40</a> argument to me as a non feminist right  
<a onclick="modifyYTiframeseektime('823')">0:13:43</a> the argument goes since men have  
<a onclick="modifyYTiframeseektime('827')">0:13:47</a> anatomical biological advantages  
<a onclick="modifyYTiframeseektime('830')">0:13:50</a> hormonal advantages and even haven't  
<a onclick="modifyYTiframeseektime('834')">0:13:54</a> gone through that process and then the  
<a onclick="modifyYTiframeseektime('838')">0:13:58</a> assignment the gender reassignment  
<a onclick="modifyYTiframeseektime('839')">0:13:59</a> happens if they now compete with women  
<a onclick="modifyYTiframeseektime('842')">0:14:02</a> it will give them an unfair advantage  
<a onclick="modifyYTiframeseektime('845')">0:14:05</a> and it will give them an entitled of a  
<a onclick="modifyYTiframeseektime('848')">0:14:08</a> privileged position in that context wait  
<a onclick="modifyYTiframeseektime('852')">0:14:12</a> a minute this is important now I thought  
<a onclick="modifyYTiframeseektime('856')">0:14:16</a> you said sex was not sex because that's  
<a onclick="modifyYTiframeseektime('860')">0:14:20</a> a third wave construct some say that sex  
<a onclick="modifyYTiframeseektime('863')">0:14:23</a> is a social construct Judith Butler  
<a onclick="modifyYTiframeseektime('865')">0:14:25</a> hinted to this in her book gender  
<a onclick="modifyYTiframeseektime('866')">0:14:26</a> troubles 1990 but not this some do say  
<a onclick="modifyYTiframeseektime('870')">0:14:30</a> that I thought you said gender was a  
<a onclick="modifyYTiframeseektime('873')">0:14:33</a> social construct no and you know it  
<a onclick="modifyYTiframeseektime('879')">0:14:39</a> becomes even more problematic do you  
<a onclick="modifyYTiframeseektime('882')">0:14:42</a> know when it becomes more problematic  
<a onclick="modifyYTiframeseektime('883')">0:14:43</a> when we start to see so the question is  
<a onclick="modifyYTiframeseektime('888')">0:14:48</a> now should there be an equality of  
<a onclick="modifyYTiframeseektime('889')">0:14:49</a> opportunity for men and women  
<a onclick="modifyYTiframeseektime('894')">0:14:54</a> in certain sports should we or should we  
<a onclick="modifyYTiframeseektime('899')">0:14:59</a> segregate and separate them you don't  
<a onclick="modifyYTiframeseektime('904')">0:15:04</a> like segregation but you have it in  
<a onclick="modifyYTiframeseektime('906')">0:15:06</a> sports but no no it's justified for  
<a onclick="modifyYTiframeseektime('909')">0:15:09</a> anatomical and biological reasons so  
<a onclick="modifyYTiframeseektime('911')">0:15:11</a> you're saying they're on biological and  
<a onclick="modifyYTiframeseektime('914')">0:15:14</a> anatomical grounds you can justify  
<a onclick="modifyYTiframeseektime('916')">0:15:16</a> separation well hold on now but men will  
<a onclick="modifyYTiframeseektime('921')">0:15:21</a> be given an advantage why don't you make  
<a onclick="modifyYTiframeseektime('924')">0:15:24</a> that argument in all context of  
<a onclick="modifyYTiframeseektime('927')">0:15:27</a> categories for instance if you look at  
<a onclick="modifyYTiframeseektime('930')">0:15:30</a> the 100-meter dash and I made this  
<a onclick="modifyYTiframeseektime('934')">0:15:34</a> argument before I make here again the  
<a onclick="modifyYTiframeseektime('936')">0:15:36</a> 100 meter sprints in the last 100 years  
<a onclick="modifyYTiframeseektime('938')">0:15:38</a> I don't know of one white man who's won  
<a onclick="modifyYTiframeseektime('941')">0:15:41</a> that no I don't know I don't know of one  
<a onclick="modifyYTiframeseektime('947')">0:15:47</a> white man that's one that it's dominated

<a onclick="modifyYTiframeseektime('955')">0:15:55</a> should we separate the blacks from the

<a onclick="modifyYTiframeseektime('963')">0:16:03</a> you're contradicting yourself you know  
<a onclick="modifyYTiframeseektime('965')">0:16:05</a> why because you said in cases where  
<a onclick="modifyYTiframeseektime('968')">0:16:08</a> there is biological and anatomical  
<a onclick="modifyYTiframeseektime('971')">0:16:11</a> advantages for one category of person  
<a onclick="modifyYTiframeseektime('974')">0:16:14</a> over another category of person there  
<a onclick="modifyYTiframeseektime('977')">0:16:17</a> should be separation so why should that  
<a onclick="modifyYTiframeseektime('979')">0:16:19</a> be the case only for gender why  
<a onclick="modifyYTiframeseektime('982')">0:16:22</a> shouldn't it also be the case for race  
<a onclick="modifyYTiframeseektime('984')">0:16:24</a> because you've recalled racist  
<a onclick="modifyYTiframeseektime('986')">0:16:26</a> this is selective invocation you see

<a onclick="modifyYTiframeseektime('997')">0:16:37</a> at long-distance you know we have

<a onclick="modifyYTiframeseektime('1013')">0:16:53</a> want to be controversial but I've never  
<a onclick="modifyYTiframeseektime('1015')">0:16:55</a> seen a black man win that swimming race  
<a onclick="modifyYTiframeseektime('1017')">0:16:57</a> I was a hallmark of Michael Phelps how  
<a onclick="modifyYTiframeseektime('1020')">0:17:00</a> many sounds is in you on it

<a onclick="modifyYTiframeseektime('1031')">0:17:11</a> feminists would say we want equality of

<a onclick="modifyYTiframeseektime('1554')">0:25:54</a> right so a little forced at around like  
<a onclick="modifyYTiframeseektime('1558')">0:25:58</a> say seventies or eighties or something  
<a onclick="modifyYTiframeseektime('1560')">0:26:00</a> right to consider this idea  
<a onclick="modifyYTiframeseektime('1562')">0:26:02</a> intersectional feminism and so  
<a onclick="modifyYTiframeseektime('1565')">0:26:05</a> intersectional feminism considers not

<a onclick="modifyYTiframeseektime('1577')">0:26:17</a> is true they might identify themselves  
<a onclick="modifyYTiframeseektime('1581')">0:26:21</a> according to race they're gonna mention  
<a onclick="modifyYTiframeseektime('1584')">0:26:24</a> religion fact about race class and

<a onclick="modifyYTiframeseektime('1589')">0:26:29</a> race class and sexuality yeah they will  
<a onclick="modifyYTiframeseektime('1594')">0:26:34</a> say they will say that we have to  
<a onclick="modifyYTiframeseektime('1598')">0:26:38</a> consider all of these entangled and  
<a onclick="modifyYTiframeseektime('1600')">0:26:40</a> interlocking identify us we can't just  
<a onclick="modifyYTiframeseektime('1605')">0:26:45</a> think about race or the kind of thing  
<a onclick="modifyYTiframeseektime('1607')">0:26:47</a> you are definitely war we have to think  
<a onclick="modifyYTiframeseektime('1609')">0:26:49</a> about gender in conjunction with race we  
<a onclick="modifyYTiframeseektime('1611')">0:26:51</a> have to think about gender in

<a onclick="modifyYTiframeseektime('1618')">0:26:58</a> on this thesis I don't know you know  
<a onclick="modifyYTiframeseektime('1626')">0:27:06</a> Sam here or something yeah who is  
<a onclick="modifyYTiframeseektime('1628')">0:27:08</a> underprivileged in her all societies

<a onclick="modifyYTiframeseektime('1648')">0:27:28</a> according to this that's true why are we  
<a onclick="modifyYTiframeseektime('1651')">0:27:31</a> only looking at one parameter gender why  
<a onclick="modifyYTiframeseektime('1654')">0:27:34</a> so the issue is the terms the sectional  
<a onclick="modifyYTiframeseektime('1657')">0:27:37</a> feminism is a conservation because you  
<a onclick="modifyYTiframeseektime('1660')">0:27:40</a> prioritize

<a onclick="modifyYTiframeseektime('1666')">0:27:46</a> why have you prioritize now the first

<a onclick="modifyYTiframeseektime('1672')">0:27:52</a> believe in self possession and they  
<a onclick="modifyYTiframeseektime('1675')">0:27:55</a> believe in self-determination would be  
<a onclick="modifyYTiframeseektime('1678')">0:27:58</a> the first thing to say would be let the  
<a onclick="modifyYTiframeseektime('1682')">0:28:02</a> woman decide for herself  
<a onclick="modifyYTiframeseektime('1684')">0:28:04</a> watch the men decide from self what they  
<a onclick="modifyYTiframeseektime('1688')">0:28:08</a> think  
<a onclick="modifyYTiframeseektime('1689')">0:28:09</a> yes what they think are the most  
<a onclick="modifyYTiframeseektime('1691')">0:28:11</a> important identifies for them in the  
<a onclick="modifyYTiframeseektime('1695')">0:28:15</a> order that they think is most important  
<a onclick="modifyYTiframeseektime('1698')">0:28:18</a> for them but this is a hybridization  
<a onclick="modifyYTiframeseektime('1703')">0:28:23</a> which to do superbook's by colonial  
<a onclick="modifyYTiframeseektime('1706')">0:28:26</a> feminist discourse in other words white  
<a onclick="modifyYTiframeseektime('1711')">0:28:31</a> feminists in England and in the USA and  
<a onclick="modifyYTiframeseektime('1715')">0:28:35</a> in France it's as if they're saying let  
<a onclick="modifyYTiframeseektime('1720')">0:28:40</a> us prioritize your ideas for you the  
<a onclick="modifyYTiframeseektime('1725')">0:28:45</a> most important thing you have to think  
<a onclick="modifyYTiframeseektime('1726')">0:28:46</a> about your analysis is gender then after  
<a onclick="modifyYTiframeseektime('1729')">0:28:49</a> that maybe is read that after that  
<a onclick="modifyYTiframeseektime('1730')">0:28:50</a> lady's class and a masters will have  
<a onclick="modifyYTiframeseektime('1732')">0:28:52</a> something different to say about that  
<a onclick="modifyYTiframeseektime('1734')">0:28:54</a> and you know I ran into her have  
<a onclick="modifyYTiframeseektime('1736')">0:28:56</a> something different to say about that  
<a onclick="modifyYTiframeseektime('1737')">0:28:57</a> and so on yes but what are you making  
<a onclick="modifyYTiframeseektime('1741')">0:29:01</a> that high authorization who gives you  
<a onclick="modifyYTiframeseektime('1743')">0:29:03</a> the right to try this I stand up no one  
<a onclick="modifyYTiframeseektime('1749')">0:29:09</a> gave you the right you cannot serve it  
<a onclick="modifyYTiframeseektime('1752')">0:29:12</a> you want to be fair you conduct a survey  
<a onclick="modifyYTiframeseektime('1756')">0:29:16</a> yeah with him believe me yes and ask  
<a onclick="modifyYTiframeseektime('1760')">0:29:20</a> them in order  
<a onclick="modifyYTiframeseektime('1762')">0:29:22</a> what other things do once you identify  
<a onclick="modifyYTiframeseektime('1767')">0:29:27</a> as the most so for example of the  
<a onclick="modifyYTiframeseektime('1771')">0:29:31</a> polygamous a than one religion number to  
<a onclick="modifyYTiframeseektime('1774')">0:29:34</a> Nationals number three German a  
<a onclick="modifyYTiframeseektime('1776')">0:29:36</a> photographer then you have no right to  
<a onclick="modifyYTiframeseektime('1779')">0:29:39</a> say to her that she should be a feminist  
<a onclick="modifyYTiframeseektime('1781')">0:29:41</a> because I love you on her worldview  
<a onclick="modifyYTiframeseektime('1786')">0:29:46</a> she has prioritized religion over above  
<a onclick="modifyYTiframeseektime('1792')">0:29:52</a> the thing about intersectional feminism  
<a onclick="modifyYTiframeseektime('1795')">0:29:55</a> is it has a propensity to  
<a onclick="modifyYTiframeseektime('1798')">0:29:58</a> philosophically self-enclosed just like  
<a onclick="modifyYTiframeseektime('1800')">0:30:00</a> the mothers so otherwise if you really  
<a onclick="modifyYTiframeseektime('1804')">0:30:04</a> want to give someone the opportunity and  
<a onclick="modifyYTiframeseektime('1808')">0:30:08</a> chance to make a decision for themselves  
<a onclick="modifyYTiframeseektime('1811')">0:30:11</a> when they make a decision which falls in  
<a onclick="modifyYTiframeseektime('1814')">0:30:14</a> line with a dominant discourse for some  
<a onclick="modifyYTiframeseektime('1816')">0:30:16</a> source you have to remove that you can't  
<a onclick="modifyYTiframeseektime('1819')">0:30:19</a> tell them now no you should always  
<a onclick="modifyYTiframeseektime('1821')">0:30:21</a> prioritize this now what is there is a  
<a onclick="modifyYTiframeseektime('1823')">0:30:23</a> tension and contradiction between what  
<a onclick="modifyYTiframeseektime('1826')">0:30:26</a> feminists understanding of gender  
<a onclick="modifyYTiframeseektime('1828')">0:30:28</a> Eurocentric understanding of gender and

<a onclick="modifyYTiframeseektime('1834')">0:30:34</a> there are what should the Zulu if she's  
<a onclick="modifyYTiframeseektime('1836')">0:30:36</a> my taxes a slap on intersectional  
<a onclick="modifyYTiframeseektime('1840')">0:30:40</a> feminism just to follow it  
<a onclick="modifyYTiframeseektime('1843')">0:30:43</a> so the question we usually ask guys and  
<a onclick="modifyYTiframeseektime('1847')">0:30:47</a> that is usually asked of us is how  
<a onclick="modifyYTiframeseektime('1851')">0:30:51</a> accommodate for feminism that's the  
<a onclick="modifyYTiframeseektime('1854')">0:30:54</a> question and they force people you know  
<a onclick="modifyYTiframeseektime('1857')">0:30:57</a> no it's not the feminism this coalition  
<a onclick="modifyYTiframeseektime('1860')">0:31:00</a> you know come to the society I'm also  
<a onclick="modifyYTiframeseektime('1865')">0:31:05</a> doing it but the point is this well I'll  
<a onclick="modifyYTiframeseektime('1882')">0:31:22</a> just say no all right so the witness is  
<a onclick="modifyYTiframeseektime('1886')">0:31:26</a> right  
<a onclick="modifyYTiframeseektime('1886')">0:31:26</a> if you give her the choice and she says  
<a onclick="modifyYTiframeseektime('1892')">0:31:32</a> actually prioritize religion over your  
<a onclick="modifyYTiframeseektime('1895')">0:31:35</a> conception of China then message the  
<a onclick="modifyYTiframeseektime('1900')">0:31:40</a> question therefore how should this slam  
<a onclick="modifyYTiframeseektime('1903')">0:31:43</a> accommodate feminism this is the  
<a onclick="modifyYTiframeseektime('1906')">0:31:46</a> question is how feminism accommodate for  
<a onclick="modifyYTiframeseektime('1908')">0:31:48</a> snap yes it's not how she slap when I  
<a onclick="modifyYTiframeseektime('1915')">0:31:55</a> come to accommodate sorry okay  
<a onclick="modifyYTiframeseektime('1916')">0:31:56</a> that's how that's my personal choice  
<a onclick="modifyYTiframeseektime('1920')">0:32:00</a> I'm looking about to anyone and this is  
<a onclick="modifyYTiframeseektime('1923')">0:32:03</a> hopefully what many women will also  
<a onclick="modifyYTiframeseektime('1926')">0:32:06</a> agree with I hope they do whether it is  
<a onclick="modifyYTiframeseektime('1928')">0:32:08</a> a contradiction we will prefer religious
