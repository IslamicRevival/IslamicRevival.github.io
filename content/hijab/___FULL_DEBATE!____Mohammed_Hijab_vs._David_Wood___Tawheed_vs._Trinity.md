 is a debate between Mohammed Hijab and David Wood on the topic of the Trinity. Hijab argues that the Trinity is not found in the Bible, while Wood points to passages like John 17:3 which mention the Father, Son, and Holy Spirit as co-equal, co-eternal beings.

**<a onclick="modifyYTiframeseektime('0')">00:00:00</a>**  a debate between Mohammed Hijab and David Wood is held. Kharitonov recites the Quran while they debate. Hijab argues that tawheed (the oneness of God) is more important than trinity (the unity of God). Wood argues that trinity is the only way to believe in God.
* **<a onclick="modifyYTiframeseektime('300')">00:05:00</a>**  introduces the participants in a debate on whether Muslims should follow the rulings of Tawheed (monotheism) or the rulings of Trinity (God being three in One). The main speaker is Mohammed Hijab, a Muslim who supports Tawheed, and David Wood, a Christian who supports Trinity.
* **<a onclick="modifyYTiframeseektime('600')">00:10:00</a>** The two debaters are discussing the Trinity, or the concept of three persons in one body in Christianity and Islam. Mohammed Hajj, an academic researcher and media host, is opposing David Wood, a Christian evangelist and preacher. The debate will focus on the essence of God from both Christian and Muslim perspectives and will be an educational discussion platform expanding on core theological concepts. There will be significant references exchanged from the Quran and the Bible. If you feel easily offended, please do not react.
* **<a onclick="modifyYTiframeseektime('900')">00:15:00</a>** Mohammed argues that the Trinity is found in the Old Testament. He points out that the Nicean Trinity is very specific, and that the Father, Son, and Holy Spirit are three co-equal, independent beings. He also mentions that whenever you find a pronoun referring to God in the Old Testament, you always find it in third person male form.
* **<a onclick="modifyYTiframeseektime('1200')">00:20:00</a>* Discusses the debate between Mohammed Hijab and David Wood over the Trinity. Mohammed Hijab argues that the Trinity is not found in the Bible, while David Wood points to passages like John 17:3 which mention the Father, Son, and Holy Spirit as co-equal Co eternal beings.
* **<a onclick="modifyYTiframeseektime('1500')">00:25:00</a>* Discusses the early Christian understanding of the Trinity, and how this understanding developed over time. It points to examples of prominent Christian figures who advocated the Trinitarian position, and argues that it was not simply a matter of authority being given to certain individuals. Finally, the video discusses the rationality of the Trinity, and how it is a contradiction.
* **<a onclick="modifyYTiframeseektime('1800')">00:30:00</a>** , Ross discusses the contradiction between the Trinity and Mohammed Hijab's assertion that Christianity is talking about the hypostatic Union because "none of Jesus" who is 100% man and 100% God tell him what is a contradiction. Ross dismisses this as impossible and points out that David Wood is part of the evangelical Christian philosophical society. Paul Koplin wrote a whole thing about how talking about social determinism and the idea that Jesus is a being who is differentiated from humans violates the Bible's teaching on the Trinity. James White, a respected scholar of Christianity, refuted Wood on the basis of Peter's verse from Chapter 3.
* **<a onclick="modifyYTiframeseektime('2100')">00:35:00</a>** Mohammed Hijab challenges David Wood to a debate, and Wood responds by discussing the Trinity and how it is found in the Bible. Wood argues that Christians believe in the Trinity because it is forced into view by the triune God, and that the doctrine of tawheed is more confusing than we hear about today.
* **<a onclick="modifyYTiframeseektime('2400')">00:40:00</a>** , a Christian debater debates Mohammed Hijab, a Muslim, on the existence of God. The Christian argues that, based on the Bible, there is only one God, who is the father, son, and spirit. However, the Muslim argues that there is a trinity of gods, Allah, the son, and the spirit, and that Allah is greater than the father and son. The Christian concludes that, as a result of this debate, he has been forced to accept the concept of the Trinity.
* **<a onclick="modifyYTiframeseektime('2700')">00:45:00</a>* Discusses how Muslims interpret Qur'an passages referring to God's face, hands, and feet. Some scholars argue that these passages must be interpreted literally, while others argue that they are figurative. Muhammad also says that certain surahs in the Quran have the ability to intercede on behalf of Muslims. Additionally, Muhammad explains that the Quran is also multi-personal, having a mother and a father.
* **<a onclick="modifyYTiframeseektime('3000')">00:50:00</a>**  Colonel Allah discusses the various ways in which he is deified in Islam. One example is through the use ofAllah's eternal speech, the spirit he breathes out, and Muhammad's companions worshipping him. Additionally, there are references to Allah being uncreated and eternal, and Jesus being a laws word and spirit from Allah. Muslims still address Muhammad directly in their prayers, and although Jesus is not physically present, Muslims believe that he hears and responds to their prayers.
* **<a onclick="modifyYTiframeseektime('3300')">00:55:00</a>** In this debate, Mohammed Hijab argues that the Quran explicitly teaches that all of Allah's physical parts will be destroyed at the end of time. David Wood responds that there are multiple translations of the Quran which say different things about Allah's physical parts, and that there is no evidence that any Muslim scholar has ever said that this is a lie.

The two Muslims debate the validity of Christianity and the Trinity. The first Muslim argues that the Quran accidentally deifies Jesus because he is mentioned in the Kalima (a Muslim formula of faith). The second Muslim points out that the Trinity is not mentioned in the Quran and that Christianity was put under the bus by the first Muslim.

**<a onclick="modifyYTiframeseektime('3600')">01:00:00</a>* Discusses a hadith that states that when a person recites the Quran, the angel carries it to the Prophet Muhammad. argues that this means Muhammad is divine, and that trinitarianism is invalid because the Quran explicitly states that Jesus is not divine.
* **<a onclick="modifyYTiframeseektime('3900')">01:05:00</a>** argues that the Islamic concept of God is more confusing than what we're typically told, and that Allah prays.
* **<a onclick="modifyYTiframeseektime('4200')">01:10:00</a>* Discusses hadith that state Allahprays for self-control in order to punish the Israelites. It also discusses the Quran, which is seen as an eternal person and takes the form of a pale man. Mohammed critiques the Trinity doctrine by saying that if individual chapters of the Quran are seen as persons, then the entire Quran should be seen as a person.
* **<a onclick="modifyYTiframeseektime('4500')">01:15:00</a>** of the video argues that if Islam is not literally based on biology, then it must be based on metaphorical concepts, which Christianity and Judaism also use. also argues that the Islamic belief in the Sonship of Jesus is wrong, and that the Islamic practice of spitting on Muhammad and collecting his blood and urine is an example of idolatry and paganism.
* **<a onclick="modifyYTiframeseektime('4800')">01:20:00</a>** , two Muslims debate the validity of Christianity and the Trinity. The first Muslim argues that the Quran accidentally deifies Jesus because he is mentioned in the Kalima (a Muslim formula of faith). The second Muslim points out that the Trinity is not mentioned in the Quran and that Christianity was put under the bus by the first Muslim.
* **<a onclick="modifyYTiframeseektime('5100')">01:25:00</a>** In a debate against David Wood, Muslim convert Mohammed Hijab points to passages in the Old Testament which suggest that God is plural. Dr. David Wood responds by saying that these passages must be interpreted away because they do not actually call for the doctrine of the Trinity.
* **<a onclick="modifyYTiframeseektime('5400')">01:30:00</a>** Mohammed Hijab argues that the three names of God, "Israel Yahweh Elohim Yahweh," are one term and not three separate entities. He argues that this doctrine of unity is revealed progressively throughout the Old Testament, and that it is not mentioned explicitly in the New Testament. Unitarian Christians, he claims, are describing Trinitarian doctrine in Trinitarian terms, which refutes the Christian doctrine of the Trinity.
* **<a onclick="modifyYTiframeseektime('5700')">01:35:00</a>** Dr. David Wood responds to Mohammed Hijab's argument that all Christian fathers were wrong in their understanding of the Trinity because of the various distinctions they made over time. Wood argues that these distinctions derive from going back to Scripture and understanding what lines up with it. He concludes that, even if every Christian father were wrong, the doctrine of the Trinity would still be true.
* **<a onclick="modifyYTiframeseektime('6000')">01:40:00</a>* Discusses the difference between the meanings of the words "Allah" and "Holy Spirit" in the Quran and hadith, and points out that Muslims translators are now translating the word "praise" in the hadith as "Allah" to avoid confusion. argues that this demonstrates the creator's hierarchy, and that only the Father knows when the hour is.
* **<a onclick="modifyYTiframeseektime('6300')">01:45:00</a>** Justin Martyr argues that just as pagans believe that Jupiter is a god, Christians believe in a God who has an earthly body and a Holy Spirit.
* **<a onclick="modifyYTiframeseektime('6600')">01:50:00</a>* Discusses the beliefs of early Christians, specifically regarding the Trinity. points to various passages from the Quran which support the idea of Tawheed - the oneness of God. Dr. Woodley asks a third question, which Touhey answers affirmatively.
* **<a onclick="modifyYTiframeseektime('6900')">01:55:00</a>* Discusses how Christianity and Islam approach the Old Testament, with Christianity viewing it as containing moral teachings, while Islam considers some of the passages to be immoral. He also points out that Muhammad taught that swearing by anything other than Allah is committing shirk, which is associating oneself with Allah.
### <a onclick="modifyYTiframeseektime('7200')">02:00:00</a> - <a onclick="modifyYTiframeseektime('10800')">03:00:00</a>

 Dr. David Wood debates Mohammed Hajab on the issue of apostolic succession in Islam. Wood points out that, historically, there was no apostolic succession between Jesus's crucifixion and the Council of Nicaea, which was the first official recognition of Christianity by the Roman Empire. This leaves Islam without a clear theological lineage between Jesus and Muhammad.

**<a onclick="modifyYTiframeseektime('7200')">02:00:00</a>* Discusses how he believes that morality can be achieved from other than an objective law, and how this applies to the Old Testament. He then goes on to say that while some bad things happen in the Old Testament, it can be reconciled with the New Testament teachings of God being love.
* **<a onclick="modifyYTiframeseektime('7500')">02:05:00</a>* Discusses the differences between early Christianity and Islam, specifically mentioning that while early Christians believed that Jesus was both God and human, some Muslims believe that Jesus was only human and not God.  argues that this is a false belief, as evidenced by the fact that the early church fathers used language to designate Jesus as both God and human's equal.
* **<a onclick="modifyYTiframeseektime('7800')">02:10:00</a>* Discusses the beliefs of early Christians, including the Ebionites, in relation to the Holy Spirit. He states that the Ebionites did not have the Bible, and that only parts of the Gospel of Matthew were available to them. points out that when Hippolytus discusses the beliefs of the Ebionites, it is a primary source material. He then uses a minute to discuss the implications of this belief on Islam.
* **<a onclick="modifyYTiframeseektime('8100')">02:15:00</a>* Discusses how various terms used in the Bible, such as "God," "Ebionites," and "Holy Spirit," can be used to describe Jesus, the Father, and the Holy Spirit. It argues that, because these terms were used seriously of Jesus, the Father, and the Holy Spirit, Christians should accept him as the Messiah and believe in his claims.
* **<a onclick="modifyYTiframeseektime('8400')">02:20:00</a>**  Dr. David Wood discusses the differences between Christianity and Islam and how they view prophets. He states that while Christianity believes in progressive revelation, Islam does not end with Jesus. At the end of the video, he offers a piece of advice for those who want to repent and be forgiven by Muslims.
* **<a onclick="modifyYTiframeseektime('8700')">02:25:00</a>* Discusses the claim that Muslim scholars make that the Prophet's companions drank his blood. He then provides a list of scholars who made this claim.
* **<a onclick="modifyYTiframeseektime('9000')">02:30:00</a>**  Dr. David Wood debates Mohammed Hajab, a Muslim cleric, on the issue of apostolic succession in Islam. Wood points out that, historically, there was no apostolic succession between Jesus's crucifixion and the Council of Nicaea, which was the first official recognition of Christianity by the Roman Empire. This leaves Islam without a clear theological lineage between Jesus and Muhammad.
* **<a onclick="modifyYTiframeseektime('9300')">02:35:00</a>** of the video argues that because of David's lack of Arabic knowledge, it is impossible for him to discern the will of God. They go on to say that there are many people who are very learned in Arabic who have the same epistemological and scientific critiques of the Quran as those who are self-professed Muslims.
* **<a onclick="modifyYTiframeseektime('9600')">02:40:00</a>** In this YouTube debate, Mohammed Hijab and David Wood discuss the Arabic language of the Quran. Wood argues that it is only Arabs who can access the Quran in its pure form, and that this is why only 5% of the population can understand it. Hijab argues that the language of the Quran is a means of communication for the people, and that it has evolved over time.
* **<a onclick="modifyYTiframeseektime('9900')">02:45:00</a>** Mohammed Hijab and David Wood debate the idea that certain beliefs in Christianity and Hinduism overlap, with Wood arguing that Christianity is not a subset of Hinduism. The discussion turns to whether or not Jesus' disciples became "higher" than those who disbelieved after his death, with Hijab arguing that this is clearly stated in the Quran.
* **<a onclick="modifyYTiframeseektime('10200')">02:50:00</a>* Discusses how Prophet Mohammed was not a god, and Christianity did not spread by the sword. It also mentions how the Quran is an authority in as much as it does not contradict the Bible.
* **<a onclick="modifyYTiframeseektime('10500')">02:55:00</a>** Mohammed Hijab and David Wood debate the difference between Islam and Christianity, with Wood concluding that Christianity is based more in scripture than in tradition. Hijab claims that Christianity is based in tradition more than scripture, and that Christians worship more Augustine than God.

, two different viewpoints on Islam are presented: that of Mohammed Hijab, a Muslim woman who argues that the Quran is better than the Bible because it is easier to understand, and that of David Wood, a Christian who argues that the Bible is better than the Quran because it is the word of God. The debate is respectful, with both sides making valid points. In the end, it is up to the individual to decide which religion is better for them.

**<a onclick="modifyYTiframeseektime('10800')">03:00:00</a>** Mohammed Hijab argues that the Bible is not the word of God because it is not easily memorized. He also points out that Abraham and Solomon had many wives, which goes against Christian teachings. Finally, he asks David Wood why he was not upset with David when he was mocking Muslims for ten years.

<a onclick="modifyYTiframeseektime('1175')">0:19:35</a> God's name let's take for example

<a onclick="modifyYTiframeseektime('1215')">0:20:15</a> so now the question would be is this a

<a onclick="modifyYTiframeseektime('1276')">0:21:16</a> know that because if you look at in line  
<a onclick="modifyYTiframeseektime('1278')">0:21:18</a> 9 to 11 it's quite explicit that God  
<a onclick="modifyYTiframeseektime('1282')">0:21:22</a> gives him the name so he didn't have it

<a onclick="modifyYTiframeseektime('1325')">0:22:05</a> the irony overall is that you'll find in

<a onclick="modifyYTiframeseektime('1345')">0:22:25</a> in the side of the church fathers that

<a onclick="modifyYTiframeseektime('1370')">0:22:50</a> father the true gods this is how severe  
<a onclick="modifyYTiframeseektime('1372')">0:22:52</a> it was when you find mark chapter 12  
<a onclick="modifyYTiframeseektime('1376')">0:22:56</a> verse 29 that you came to Jesus asking

<a onclick="modifyYTiframeseektime('1420')">0:23:40</a> is where do people Christians today  
<a onclick="modifyYTiframeseektime('1422')">0:23:42</a> where do they get their information of  
<a onclick="modifyYTiframeseektime('1423')">0:23:43</a> the Trinity you'll find that in Matthew  
<a onclick="modifyYTiframeseektime('1427')">0:23:47</a> chapter 28 verse 19 it talks about it's  
<a onclick="modifyYTiframeseektime('1431')">0:23:51</a> called the baptismal formula where the

<a onclick="modifyYTiframeseektime('1441')">0:24:01</a> just proof okay is in the Bible now the  
<a onclick="modifyYTiframeseektime('1444')">0:24:04</a> users say look the Trinity is in the  
<a onclick="modifyYTiframeseektime('1447')">0:24:07</a> Bible now but why don't they look at  
<a onclick="modifyYTiframeseektime('1449')">0:24:09</a> Luke chapter 9 verse 26 because Luke  
<a onclick="modifyYTiframeseektime('1451')">0:24:11</a> chapter 9 verse 26 has a different  
<a onclick="modifyYTiframeseektime('1453')">0:24:13</a> triadic formula where there's the father

<a onclick="modifyYTiframeseektime('1466')">0:24:26</a> question now we've had these debates

<a onclick="modifyYTiframeseektime('1739')">0:28:59</a> that you had for example Athanasius who

<a onclick="modifyYTiframeseektime('2221')">0:37:01</a> hear much about in Mohammed had jobs

<a onclick="modifyYTiframeseektime('2230')">0:37:10</a> confusing than we hear about today so  
<a onclick="modifyYTiframeseektime('2234')">0:37:14</a> let's compare them and we'll start with  
<a onclick="modifyYTiframeseektime('2236')">0:37:16</a> the Trinity why do Christians believe in  
<a onclick="modifyYTiframeseektime('2239')">0:37:19</a> the doctrine of the Trinity we believe  
<a onclick="modifyYTiframeseektime('2245')">0:37:25</a> it because we are forced into this view  
<a onclick="modifyYTiframeseektime('2246')">0:37:26</a> by the triune God not because of church  
<a onclick="modifyYTiframeseektime('2250')">0:37:30</a> councils the church councils were forced  
<a onclick="modifyYTiframeseektime('2252')">0:37:32</a> into that view by the triune God for  
<a onclick="modifyYTiframeseektime('2260')">0:37:40</a> Christians  
<a onclick="modifyYTiframeseektime('2261')">0:37:41</a> we have certain amount of data that we  
<a onclick="modifyYTiframeseektime('2264')">0:37:44</a> work with everyone has some data right  
<a onclick="modifyYTiframeseektime('2266')">0:37:46</a> we look around we see the world we see  
<a onclick="modifyYTiframeseektime('2267')">0:37:47</a> that it's organized in certain ways we  
<a onclick="modifyYTiframeseektime('2269')">0:37:49</a> know that there's a moral law there are  
<a onclick="modifyYTiframeseektime('2271')">0:37:51</a> hundreds of millions of people in the

<a onclick="modifyYTiframeseektime('2273')">0:37:53</a> witnessed miracles all of this helps us  
<a onclick="modifyYTiframeseektime('2276')">0:37:56</a> formulate a concept of God but  
<a onclick="modifyYTiframeseektime('2279')">0:37:59</a> Christians also have the Scriptures the  
<a onclick="modifyYTiframeseektime('2281')">0:38:01</a> Old Testament and the New Testament and  
<a onclick="modifyYTiframeseektime('2283')">0:38:03</a> when we start reading the scriptures  
<a onclick="modifyYTiframeseektime('2286')">0:38:06</a> things get very interesting very quickly  
<a onclick="modifyYTiframeseektime('2289')">0:38:09</a> so these are the first two verses of the  
<a onclick="modifyYTiframeseektime('2292')">0:38:12</a> Bible long before Christians came along  
<a onclick="modifyYTiframeseektime('2293')">0:38:13</a> in the beginning God created the heavens  
<a onclick="modifyYTiframeseektime('2296')">0:38:16</a> and the earth and the earth was without  
<a onclick="modifyYTiframeseektime('2298')">0:38:18</a> form and void and darkness was over the  
<a onclick="modifyYTiframeseektime('2301')">0:38:21</a> face of the deep and the Spirit of God  
<a onclick="modifyYTiframeseektime('2304')">0:38:24</a> was hovering over the face of the waters  
<a onclick="modifyYTiframeseektime('2308')">0:38:28</a> so we've got God but then there's a  
<a onclick="modifyYTiframeseektime('2311')">0:38:31</a> distinction it says and the Spirit of  
<a onclick="modifyYTiframeseektime('2312')">0:38:32</a> God was hovering over the face of the  
<a onclick="modifyYTiframeseektime('2316')">0:38:36</a> waters  
<a onclick="modifyYTiframeseektime('2317')">0:38:37</a> later in the same chapter opening  
<a onclick="modifyYTiframeseektime('2320')">0:38:40</a> chapter the Bible verse 26 we read then  
<a onclick="modifyYTiframeseektime('2323')">0:38:43</a> God said let us make man in our image  
<a onclick="modifyYTiframeseektime('2328')">0:38:48</a> after our likeness now two obvious  
<a onclick="modifyYTiframeseektime('2332')">0:38:52</a> questions one who is he talking to  
<a onclick="modifyYTiframeseektime('2335')">0:38:55</a> and two why does he say let us plural  
<a onclick="modifyYTiframeseektime('2338')">0:38:58</a> make man plural I mean make man in our  
<a onclick="modifyYTiframeseektime('2341')">0:39:01</a> Laurel image the plural of majesty right  
<a onclick="modifyYTiframeseektime('2346')">0:39:06</a> well the Jews didn't use the plural of  
<a onclick="modifyYTiframeseektime('2348')">0:39:08</a> majesty so why is he using this it's  
<a onclick="modifyYTiframeseektime('2352')">0:39:12</a> just a mystery so far we don't know yet  
<a onclick="modifyYTiframeseektime('2355')">0:39:15</a> but as we continue reading the mystery  
<a onclick="modifyYTiframeseektime('2358')">0:39:18</a> gets deeper in Isaiah 9:6 the Prophet  
<a onclick="modifyYTiframeseektime('2362')">0:39:22</a> delivers a prophecy for to us a child is  
<a onclick="modifyYTiframeseektime('2366')">0:39:26</a> born to us a son is given and the

<a onclick="modifyYTiframeseektime('4343')">1:12:23</a> what it means because of the next point  
<a onclick="modifyYTiframeseektime('4345')">1:12:25</a> which is that individual chapters of the

<a onclick="modifyYTiframeseektime('4759')">1:19:19</a> Muhammad said mamita job said that

<a onclick="modifyYTiframeseektime('4816')">1:20:16</a> really noticed you you can read in the

<a onclick="modifyYTiframeseektime('4823')">1:20:23</a> that they believed in these seven

<a onclick="modifyYTiframeseektime('4831')">1:20:31</a> want to reconcile this with Islam's you  
<a onclick="modifyYTiframeseektime('4833')">1:20:33</a> have to say Abraham set that up walking  
<a onclick="modifyYTiframeseektime('4835')">1:20:35</a> the seven circles and then the pagans  
<a onclick="modifyYTiframeseektime('4837')">1:20:37</a> misinterpreted it at some point and they  
<a onclick="modifyYTiframeseektime('4839')">1:20:39</a> started walking seven circles around the

<a onclick="modifyYTiframeseektime('4845')">1:20:45</a> as far as the black stone well it was a  
<a onclick="modifyYTiframeseektime('4847')">1:20:47</a> black stone and then it became part of  
<a onclick="modifyYTiframeseektime('4849')">1:20:49</a> their pagan worship and then got brought

<a onclick="modifyYTiframeseektime('5501')">1:31:41</a> similar to what you find when Moses

<a onclick="modifyYTiframeseektime('5573')">1:32:53</a> doesn't the Trinity just clearly define  
<a onclick="modifyYTiframeseektime('5575')">1:32:55</a> I mean why doesn't the Old Testament

<a onclick="modifyYTiframeseektime('5603')">1:33:23</a> the world and then the Holy Spirit being  
<a onclick="modifyYTiframeseektime('5606')">1:33:26</a> poured out where we find out about the

<a onclick="modifyYTiframeseektime('5618')">1:33:38</a> mentioned well that's how God works the

<a onclick="modifyYTiframeseektime('5623')">1:33:43</a> throughout the Bible he keeps giving

<a onclick="modifyYTiframeseektime('5656')">1:34:16</a> collected let's think about how  
<a onclick="modifyYTiframeseektime('5657')">1:34:17</a> Christians are there there you've got  
<a onclick="modifyYTiframeseektime('5659')">1:34:19</a> farmers you've got fishermen and so on  
<a onclick="modifyYTiframeseektime('5660')">1:34:20</a> you don't have this early on this  
<a onclick="modifyYTiframeseektime('5664')">1:34:24</a> professional class of theologians that  
<a onclick="modifyYTiframeseektime('5666')">1:34:26</a> builds up over time and for the first

<a onclick="modifyYTiframeseektime('5680')">1:34:40</a> have and to have discussions like this  
<a onclick="modifyYTiframeseektime('5682')">1:34:42</a> the first time they're able to get  
<a onclick="modifyYTiframeseektime('5685')">1:34:45</a> together and have these big these big

<a onclick="modifyYTiframeseektime('5691')">1:34:51</a> out very quickly so the problem as far  
<a onclick="modifyYTiframeseektime('5694')">1:34:54</a> as what's revealed to the Christians  
<a onclick="modifyYTiframeseektime('5697')">1:34:57</a> they have revelations about the father

<a onclick="modifyYTiframeseektime('5721')">1:35:21</a> difficult work to do so that sort of  
<a onclick="modifyYTiframeseektime('5724')">1:35:24</a> thing takes a while and they don't have  
<a onclick="modifyYTiframeseektime('5726')">1:35:26</a> the terminology how are you describing  
<a onclick="modifyYTiframeseektime('5727')">1:35:27</a> God being one in essence or nature and

<a onclick="modifyYTiframeseektime('5732')">1:35:32</a> there's no language to apply to the  
<a onclick="modifyYTiframeseektime('5734')">1:35:34</a> eternal God they eventually settle on  
<a onclick="modifyYTiframeseektime('5736')">1:35:36</a> some but that takes time but throughout  
<a onclick="modifyYTiframeseektime('5739')">1:35:39</a> this father is God Holy Spirit is God

<a onclick="modifyYTiframeseektime('5749')">1:35:49</a> and by the way just imagine if if we're

<a onclick="modifyYTiframeseektime('5762')">1:36:02</a> well it's LOM should be defined by the

<a onclick="modifyYTiframeseektime('5910')">1:38:30</a> take someone like Tertullian or  
<a onclick="modifyYTiframeseektime('5911')">1:38:31</a> something like this and say who calls

<a onclick="modifyYTiframeseektime('5922')">1:38:42</a> mean when they say the Holy Spirit is  
<a onclick="modifyYTiframeseektime('5924')">1:38:44</a> God what do you think the Bible means  
<a onclick="modifyYTiframeseektime('5926')">1:38:46</a> the Bible calls him eternal what do you  
<a onclick="modifyYTiframeseektime('5929')">1:38:49</a> mean koete urn Allah if he's eternal  
<a onclick="modifyYTiframeseektime('5931')">1:38:51</a> then he's obviously Co eternal with the  
<a onclick="modifyYTiframeseektime('5933')">1:38:53</a> father so I'm not under it's like it's  
<a onclick="modifyYTiframeseektime('5937')">1:38:57</a> like saying if I tell you I am the

<a onclick="modifyYTiframeseektime('5950')">1:39:10</a> that other thing right so if you say so  
<a onclick="modifyYTiframeseektime('5953')">1:39:13</a> and so is God or so-and-so has the  
<a onclick="modifyYTiframeseektime('5955')">1:39:15</a> attributes of God it just doesn't make  
<a onclick="modifyYTiframeseektime('5959')">1:39:19</a> it just doesn't make sense to say well  
<a onclick="modifyYTiframeseektime('5960')">1:39:20</a> where is he  
<a onclick="modifyYTiframeseektime('5960')">1:39:20</a> co-equal with the Father echo this these  
<a onclick="modifyYTiframeseektime('5963')">1:39:23</a> are one minute these are terms these are  
<a onclick="modifyYTiframeseektime('5965')">1:39:25</a> terms this is language that was used in

<a onclick="modifyYTiframeseektime('5976')">1:39:36</a> say where does the Quran say that the

<a onclick="modifyYTiframeseektime('5981')">1:39:41</a> conclusion you draw right that's a  
<a onclick="modifyYTiframeseektime('5983')">1:39:43</a> conclusion you draw from various things

<a onclick="modifyYTiframeseektime('5986')">1:39:46</a> right you have to interpret it that way  
<a onclick="modifyYTiframeseektime('5988')">1:39:48</a> I don't understand why you can say okay  
<a onclick="modifyYTiframeseektime('5991')">1:39:51</a> well the Bible says that the father is  
<a onclick="modifyYTiframeseektime('5993')">1:39:53</a> God the Holy Spirit is God the Son is  
<a onclick="modifyYTiframeseektime('5995')">1:39:55</a> God  
<a onclick="modifyYTiframeseektime('5996')">1:39:56</a> and therefore as far as the essent as  
<a onclick="modifyYTiframeseektime('5998')">1:39:58</a> far as their essence they're all god  
<a onclick="modifyYTiframeseektime('6000')">1:40:00</a> they're all Yahweh and therefore in that  
<a onclick="modifyYTiframeseektime('6002')">1:40:02</a> sense they are co-equal so what you have  
<a onclick="modifyYTiframeseektime('6006')">1:40:06</a> is later church father saying ok if they  
<a onclick="modifyYTiframeseektime('6008')">1:40:08</a> all share the same essence then in that  
<a onclick="modifyYTiframeseektime('6009')">1:40:09</a> sense they're co-equal why would they  
<a onclick="modifyYTiframeseektime('6012')">1:40:12</a> why would you expect someone in the  
<a onclick="modifyYTiframeseektime('6013')">1:40:13</a> first century to use a word that came  
<a onclick="modifyYTiframeseektime('6016')">1:40:16</a> about to clarify something in the fourth

<a onclick="modifyYTiframeseektime('6019')">1:40:19</a> thank you very much dr. bud you may ask  
<a onclick="modifyYTiframeseektime('6025')">1:40:25</a> your first question in towards mr. Raja  
<a onclick="modifyYTiframeseektime('6028')">1:40:28</a> yes  
<a onclick="modifyYTiframeseektime('6030')">1:40:30</a> going back to Allah pray because I'm not  
<a onclick="modifyYTiframeseektime('6033')">1:40:33</a> just trying to mess with you guys here  
<a onclick="modifyYTiframeseektime('6034')">1:40:34</a> really I'm really confused right because  
<a onclick="modifyYTiframeseektime('6038')">1:40:38</a> as I pointed out you have Muslim  
<a onclick="modifyYTiframeseektime('6040')">1:40:40</a> translators translating passages in the  
<a onclick="modifyYTiframeseektime('6042')">1:40:42</a> hadith saying that Allah and His  
<a onclick="modifyYTiframeseektime('6045')">1:40:45</a> creation prays and you look at the Quran  
<a onclick="modifyYTiframeseektime('6048')">1:40:48</a> and it's using similar word but this is  
<a onclick="modifyYTiframeseektime('6050')">1:40:50</a> different this is the Quran and you know  
<a onclick="modifyYTiframeseektime('6052')">1:40:52</a> it's multiple passages and then we'll  
<a onclick="modifyYTiframeseektime('6054')">1:40:54</a> some translators are translating it as  
<a onclick="modifyYTiframeseektime('6056')">1:40:56</a> praise and then you have I think it's  
<a onclick="modifyYTiframeseektime('6058')">1:40:58</a> turma D which which use it and it won't  
<a onclick="modifyYTiframeseektime('6059')">1:40:59</a> translate as anything it just says a lot  
<a onclick="modifyYTiframeseektime('6061')">1:41:01</a> of performances a lot right they won't  
<a onclick="modifyYTiframeseektime('6063')">1:41:03</a> say what it means because if you say it  
<a onclick="modifyYTiframeseektime('6065')">1:41:05</a> means praise then you're going to be  
<a onclick="modifyYTiframeseektime('6066')">1:41:06</a> confused and if you translated it  
<a onclick="modifyYTiframeseektime('6068')">1:41:08</a> something else well if you're then  
<a onclick="modifyYTiframeseektime('6071')">1:41:11</a> you're gonna have to nail down a  
<a onclick="modifyYTiframeseektime('6072')">1:41:12</a> definition of the word so what should  
<a onclick="modifyYTiframeseektime('6074')">1:41:14</a> this word mean what should this in the  
<a onclick="modifyYTiframeseektime('6077')">1:41:17</a> in the Quran and the hadith how should  
<a onclick="modifyYTiframeseektime('6079')">1:41:19</a> this be translated and why are even  
<a onclick="modifyYTiframeseektime('6084')">1:41:24</a> Muslim translators now translating as  
<a onclick="modifyYTiframeseektime('6086')">1:41:26</a> praise if there's this clear other  
<a onclick="modifyYTiframeseektime('6088')">1:41:28</a> meaning I have two minutes I don't think  
<a onclick="modifyYTiframeseektime('6091')">1:41:31</a> I need two minutes to be honest with you  
<a onclick="modifyYTiframeseektime('6093')">1:41:33</a> I think I've dealt with that extensively  
<a onclick="modifyYTiframeseektime('6094')">1:41:34</a> the well Salah solidly Allah is  
<a onclick="modifyYTiframeseektime('6097')">1:41:37</a> different from so Leela and this these  
<a onclick="modifyYTiframeseektime('6099')">1:41:39</a> are basically these are certain  
<a onclick="modifyYTiframeseektime('6102')">1:41:42</a> propositional words that come after the  
<a onclick="modifyYTiframeseektime('6106')">1:41:46</a> verb and depending on which of those  
<a onclick="modifyYTiframeseektime('6109')">1:41:49</a> words come it differentiates the meaning  
<a onclick="modifyYTiframeseektime('6111')">1:41:51</a> completely so because it says Allah  
<a onclick="modifyYTiframeseektime('6113')">1:41:53</a> Allah and you'll never find anyone the  
<a onclick="modifyYTiframeseektime('6114')">1:41:54</a> Quran verse says leave for example after  
<a onclick="modifyYTiframeseektime('6117')">1:41:57</a> the Asolo respects of Sarah province  
<a onclick="modifyYTiframeseektime('6119')">1:41:59</a> Rosalind linguists and Muslims clearly

<a onclick="modifyYTiframeseektime('6125')">1:42:05</a> it means blessings etc now obviously  
<a onclick="modifyYTiframeseektime('6128')">1:42:08</a> just looking at the Quran on a cursory  
<a onclick="modifyYTiframeseektime('6131')">1:42:11</a> level if you read it in English  
<a onclick="modifyYTiframeseektime('6133')">1:42:13</a> translations of the meanings you'll find  
<a onclick="modifyYTiframeseektime('6135')">1:42:15</a> that there are certain verses before I'm  
<a onclick="modifyYTiframeseektime('6136')">1:42:16</a> if you are just if you respect your  
<a onclick="modifyYTiframeseektime('6138')">1:42:18</a> intellect you will see that it does not  
<a onclick="modifyYTiframeseektime('6142')">1:42:22</a> tell you to pray to Prophet Muhammad  
<a onclick="modifyYTiframeseektime('6143')">1:42:23</a> does not because it tells you only let  
<a onclick="modifyYTiframeseektime('6145')">1:42:25</a> Allah Hill and the Quran says lie lie  
<a onclick="modifyYTiframeseektime('6146')">1:42:26</a> low only God is worthy of worship you  
<a onclick="modifyYTiframeseektime('6149')">1:42:29</a> know these things so one minute I  
<a onclick="modifyYTiframeseektime('6152')">1:42:32</a> appreciate that you've come a bit more  
<a onclick="modifyYTiframeseektime('6153')">1:42:33</a> humble this time and you said I'm  
<a onclick="modifyYTiframeseektime('6155')">1:42:35</a> confused I hope I hope you have  
<a onclick="modifyYTiframeseektime('6158')">1:42:38</a> understood this now and if you don't I  
<a onclick="modifyYTiframeseektime('6159')">1:42:39</a> think you should blame your intellect  
<a onclick="modifyYTiframeseektime('6161')">1:42:41</a> and your lack of knowledge that's that's  
<a onclick="modifyYTiframeseektime('6163')">1:42:43</a> that's the state it should be right now  
<a onclick="modifyYTiframeseektime('6164')">1:42:44</a> but just to just to kind of touch upon  
<a onclick="modifyYTiframeseektime('6166')">1:42:46</a> what you said because I do have a bit of  
<a onclick="modifyYTiframeseektime('6168')">1:42:48</a> time back so Chilean he was a  
<a onclick="modifyYTiframeseektime('6169')">1:42:49</a> subordination list so Julian was a  
<a onclick="modifyYTiframeseektime('6171')">1:42:51</a> subordination is he died 240 I don't  
<a onclick="modifyYTiframeseektime('6173')">1:42:53</a> actually think you read his works yeah I  
<a onclick="modifyYTiframeseektime('6175')">1:42:55</a> don't believe you read his works his  
<a onclick="modifyYTiframeseektime('6177')">1:42:57</a> primary source materials all stipulate  
<a onclick="modifyYTiframeseektime('6178')">1:42:58</a> he does use the language of the fourth  
<a onclick="modifyYTiframeseektime('6180')">1:43:00</a> century men but he does not use it in  
<a onclick="modifyYTiframeseektime('6182')">1:43:02</a> the context of the Holy Spirit and so  
<a onclick="modifyYTiframeseektime('6185')">1:43:05</a> therefore I conclude that so Chilean was  
<a onclick="modifyYTiframeseektime('6187')">1:43:07</a> and that's why he's deemed as a heretic  
<a onclick="modifyYTiframeseektime('6188')">1:43:08</a> by the Catholics he's and and by the  
<a onclick="modifyYTiframeseektime('6190')">1:43:10</a> Protestants he's deemed and other people  
<a onclick="modifyYTiframeseektime('6192')">1:43:12</a> are deemed as heretics so it's a back  
<a onclick="modifyYTiframeseektime('6194')">1:43:14</a> projection based on later developments  
<a onclick="modifyYTiframeseektime('6196')">1:43:16</a> of the church and this is something you  
<a onclick="modifyYTiframeseektime('6198')">1:43:18</a> could not deal with basically in this  
<a onclick="modifyYTiframeseektime('6200')">1:43:20</a> second in the end in this particular in  
<a onclick="modifyYTiframeseektime('6203')">1:43:23</a> this particular debate thank you very  
<a onclick="modifyYTiframeseektime('6210')">1:43:30</a> much mr. job you might go forward with  
<a onclick="modifyYTiframeseektime('6211')">1:43:31</a> your second question all right so you  
<a onclick="modifyYTiframeseektime('6213')">1:43:33</a> you spoke about the attributes of you  
<a onclick="modifyYTiframeseektime('6216')">1:43:36</a> spoke about the attributes of the Holy  
<a onclick="modifyYTiframeseektime('6217')">1:43:37</a> Spirit etc I'm just going to give you  
<a onclick="modifyYTiframeseektime('6220')">1:43:40</a> one example I mean it's a very easy  
<a onclick="modifyYTiframeseektime('6222')">1:43:42</a> question in mark chapter 13 verse 32 it  
<a onclick="modifyYTiframeseektime('6226')">1:43:46</a> says only the Father Knows when the hour  
<a onclick="modifyYTiframeseektime('6228')">1:43:48</a> is now I understand why the son might  
<a onclick="modifyYTiframeseektime('6231')">1:43:51</a> not know because it's the human side you  
<a onclick="modifyYTiframeseektime('6232')">1:43:52</a> see it's the human side so he you know  
<a onclick="modifyYTiframeseektime('6235')">1:43:55</a> the god side might know what the human  
<a onclick="modifyYTiframeseektime('6237')">1:43:57</a> but what about the Holy Spirit why does  
<a onclick="modifyYTiframeseektime('6239')">1:43:59</a> the Holy Spirit not know when the hour  
<a onclick="modifyYTiframeseektime('6241')">1:44:01</a> is  
<a onclick="modifyYTiframeseektime('6244')">1:44:04</a> I have two minutes dr. hood well the  
<a onclick="modifyYTiframeseektime('6249')">1:44:09</a> Holy Spirit is included  
<a onclick="modifyYTiframeseektime('6251')">1:44:11</a> we have elsewhere that the Holy Spirit  
<a onclick="modifyYTiframeseektime('6254')">1:44:14</a> searches the mind of God and knows  
<a onclick="modifyYTiframeseektime('6255')">1:44:15</a> everything that God knows if you look at  
<a onclick="modifyYTiframeseektime('6258')">1:44:18</a> what Jesus is doing there when he says  
<a onclick="modifyYTiframeseektime('6261')">1:44:21</a> when he says no one he's referring to  
<a onclick="modifyYTiframeseektime('6263')">1:44:23</a> the level of human beings by the way if  
<a onclick="modifyYTiframeseektime('6264')">1:44:24</a> you if you guys like that verse that's  
<a onclick="modifyYTiframeseektime('6267')">1:44:27</a> uh if you believe Jesus said that then  
<a onclick="modifyYTiframeseektime('6269')">1:44:29</a> Islam is false because notice you've got  
<a onclick="modifyYTiframeseektime('6271')">1:44:31</a> father and son there according to Quran  
<a onclick="modifyYTiframeseektime('6273')">1:44:33</a> Allah as a father to know in the highest  
<a onclick="modifyYTiframeseektime('6275')">1:44:35</a> relationship you can have with Allah as  
<a onclick="modifyYTiframeseektime('6276')">1:44:36</a> a slave to master relationship so did  
<a onclick="modifyYTiframeseektime('6279')">1:44:39</a> you believe that then Islam is false but  
<a onclick="modifyYTiframeseektime('6282')">1:44:42</a> if you look what he says there already  
<a onclick="modifyYTiframeseektime('6285')">1:44:45</a> he sets up a hierarchy says the day of  
<a onclick="modifyYTiframeseektime('6288')">1:44:48</a> their time he says no one knows  
<a onclick="modifyYTiframeseektime('6290')">1:44:50</a> referring to the level of men and then  
<a onclick="modifyYTiframeseektime('6292')">1:44:52</a> he says not even the angels so that's  
<a onclick="modifyYTiframeseektime('6296')">1:44:56</a> the entire created order no man knows  
<a onclick="modifyYTiframeseektime('6299')">1:44:59</a> not even the angels not even the son  
<a onclick="modifyYTiframeseektime('6303')">1:45:03</a> only the father so even in this verse  
<a onclick="modifyYTiframeseektime('6306')">1:45:06</a> you're quoting he's putting himself one  
<a onclick="modifyYTiframeseektime('6309')">1:45:09</a> minute left he's putting himself above  
<a onclick="modifyYTiframeseektime('6311')">1:45:11</a> all of creation he's putting himself  
<a onclick="modifyYTiframeseektime('6314')">1:45:14</a> above all of creation and so the  
<a onclick="modifyYTiframeseektime('6317')">1:45:17</a> question is why wouldn't why would Jesus  
<a onclick="modifyYTiframeseektime('6319')">1:45:19</a> say that he doesn't know the hour well  
<a onclick="modifyYTiframeseektime('6320')">1:45:20</a> there's there's a long explanation which  
<a onclick="modifyYTiframeseektime('6323')">1:45:23</a> I'm not even sure it is correct but  
<a onclick="modifyYTiframeseektime('6326')">1:45:26</a> usually we would we would explain this  
<a onclick="modifyYTiframeseektime('6328')">1:45:28</a> in terms given the easier one here  
<a onclick="modifyYTiframeseektime('6332')">1:45:32</a> you're interfering of my time here they  
<a onclick="modifyYTiframeseektime('6335')">1:45:35</a> straightforward one is Christians also  
<a onclick="modifyYTiframeseektime('6338')">1:45:38</a> believe in the canosa's when Jesus takes  
<a onclick="modifyYTiframeseektime('6341')">1:45:41</a> on human nature they find this in John  
<a onclick="modifyYTiframeseektime('6343')">1:45:43</a> one and Mohammed mentioned earlier the  
<a onclick="modifyYTiframeseektime('6347')">1:45:47</a> the him to Christ in Philippians where  
<a onclick="modifyYTiframeseektime('6350')">1:45:50</a> it says he was in the form of God but he  
<a onclick="modifyYTiframeseektime('6352')">1:45:52</a> made himself nothing taking on the  
<a onclick="modifyYTiframeseektime('6354')">1:45:54</a> nature of a servant and we believe he  
<a onclick="modifyYTiframeseektime('6356')">1:45:56</a> actually took on the nature of the  
<a onclick="modifyYTiframeseektime('6358')">1:45:58</a> servants and limited himself in that way  
<a onclick="modifyYTiframeseektime('6361')">1:46:01</a> if you believe it's a problem by the way  
<a onclick="modifyYTiframeseektime('6363')">1:46:03</a> I mean think about it the Quran doesn't  
<a onclick="modifyYTiframeseektime('6364')">1:46:04</a> contain verses that the eternal Quran  
<a onclick="modifyYTiframeseektime('6366')">1:46:06</a> has and yet you still believe you have

<a onclick="modifyYTiframeseektime('6692')">1:51:32</a> thing as for as for Justin Martyr now  
<a onclick="modifyYTiframeseektime('6695')">1:51:35</a> Justin everyone acknowledges that Justin  
<a onclick="modifyYTiframeseektime('6697')">1:51:37</a> Martyr makes a bad comparison but he's

<a onclick="modifyYTiframeseektime('6718')">1:51:58</a> persecuting us you can't draw a  
<a onclick="modifyYTiframeseektime('6720')">1:52:00</a> tremendous amount of that about our  
<a onclick="modifyYTiframeseektime('6724')">1:52:04</a> theology coming from them especially  
<a onclick="modifyYTiframeseektime('6728')">1:52:08</a> when you have Old Testament passages  
<a onclick="modifyYTiframeseektime('6730')">1:52:10</a> send out the son the Messiah

<a onclick="modifyYTiframeseektime('6741')">1:52:21</a> third question yes Touhey when we look  
<a onclick="modifyYTiframeseektime('6753')">1:52:33</a> at all the things we have here we have  
<a onclick="modifyYTiframeseektime('6755')">1:52:35</a> the eternal word of allah which is co  
<a onclick="modifyYTiframeseektime('6758')">1:52:38</a> eternal and so he's got his Co eternal  
<a onclick="modifyYTiframeseektime('6759')">1:52:39</a> word with them we've got a spirit we've  
<a onclick="modifyYTiframeseektime('6762')">1:52:42</a> got all of these different things going  
<a onclick="modifyYTiframeseektime('6764')">1:52:44</a> on and then you have the word tell heed  
<a onclick="modifyYTiframeseektime('6769')">1:52:49</a> to describe it which doesn't simply mean  
<a onclick="modifyYTiframeseektime('6771')">1:52:51</a> oneness as I understand it's right so  
<a onclick="modifyYTiframeseektime('6773')">1:52:53</a> since you're talking about the Arabic  
<a onclick="modifyYTiframeseektime('6775')">1:52:55</a> here as I understand it comes from Ojeda  
<a onclick="modifyYTiframeseektime('6778')">1:52:58</a> which means to unify and therefore  
<a onclick="modifyYTiframeseektime('6781')">1:53:01</a> tawheed means the unification but if  
<a onclick="modifyYTiframeseektime('6784')">1:53:04</a> you're unifying something then you're  
<a onclick="modifyYTiframeseektime('6785')">1:53:05</a> bringing different things together and  
<a onclick="modifyYTiframeseektime('6787')">1:53:07</a> so if we look and we see these flocks of  
<a onclick="modifyYTiframeseektime('6790')">1:53:10</a> birds taking the place of the pagan  
<a onclick="modifyYTiframeseektime('6793')">1:53:13</a> goddesses and interceding for you and  
<a onclick="modifyYTiframeseektime('6795')">1:53:15</a> things like that could this word tell  
<a onclick="modifyYTiframeseektime('6801')">1:53:21</a> heed means something beyond oneness here  
<a onclick="modifyYTiframeseektime('6804')">1:53:24</a> when we see all of these different  
<a onclick="modifyYTiframeseektime('6805')">1:53:25</a> things if Allah is trying to avoid  
<a onclick="modifyYTiframeseektime('6807')">1:53:27</a> anything but Touhey and you've got all  
<a onclick="modifyYTiframeseektime('6809')">1:53:29</a> of these different things and things  
<a onclick="modifyYTiframeseektime('6811')">1:53:31</a> that are Co eternal with them and  
<a onclick="modifyYTiframeseektime('6813')">1:53:33</a> interceding flocks of birds how do we  
<a onclick="modifyYTiframeseektime('6819')">1:53:39</a> reconcile all this okay thank you so  
<a onclick="modifyYTiframeseektime('6823')">1:53:43</a> here is a we equal a muster in the  
<a onclick="modifyYTiframeseektime('6825')">1:53:45</a> Arabic language yes you're right to say  
<a onclick="modifyYTiframeseektime('6827')">1:53:47</a> it comes from the Arabic word Waheeda  
<a onclick="modifyYTiframeseektime('6829')">1:53:49</a> which means unifying something and it  
<a onclick="modifyYTiframeseektime('6833')">1:53:53</a> could mean different things in different  
<a onclick="modifyYTiframeseektime('6834')">1:53:54</a> contexts for sure now the quran let's  
<a onclick="modifyYTiframeseektime('6837')">1:53:57</a> look at what the quran actually says the  
<a onclick="modifyYTiframeseektime('6838')">1:53:58</a> quran says cool who allah who one more

<a onclick="modifyYTiframeseektime('6955')">1:55:55</a> of your content online in the past week  
<a onclick="modifyYTiframeseektime('6958')">1:55:58</a> or two I found that seemingly I mean you

<a onclick="modifyYTiframeseektime('6963')">1:56:03</a> seem to make a moral case for  
<a onclick="modifyYTiframeseektime('6967')">1:56:07</a> Christianity in a moral case against  
<a onclick="modifyYTiframeseektime('6968')">1:56:08</a> Islam I watched one of your videos with

<a onclick="modifyYTiframeseektime('6976')">1:56:16</a> it's on the record he said if Jesus and

<a onclick="modifyYTiframeseektime('6989')">1:56:29</a> which is deemed as immoral because as a  
<a onclick="modifyYTiframeseektime('6992')">1:56:32</a> divine command theorist I would expect  
<a onclick="modifyYTiframeseektime('6995')">1:56:35</a> you to believe that all of the things in  
<a onclick="modifyYTiframeseektime('6997')">1:56:37</a> the Old Testament in terms of  
<a onclick="modifyYTiframeseektime('6999')">1:56:39</a> injunctions if there had been made by  
<a onclick="modifyYTiframeseektime('7000')">1:56:40</a> Jesus who is meant to be the author of  
<a onclick="modifyYTiframeseektime('7002')">1:56:42</a> the Old Testament God the triune God  
<a onclick="modifyYTiframeseektime('7004')">1:56:44</a> would have been good but you actually  
<a onclick="modifyYTiframeseektime('7007')">1:56:47</a> said it's bad there are lots of Baptist  
<a onclick="modifyYTiframeseektime('7009')">1:56:49</a> these rewards there are lots of bad

<a onclick="modifyYTiframeseektime('7012')">1:56:52</a> now if Jesus is God and he's the old

<a onclick="modifyYTiframeseektime('7017')">1:56:57</a> has bad injunctions how can you  
<a onclick="modifyYTiframeseektime('7020')">1:57:00</a> reconcile the fact that God a maximally  
<a onclick="modifyYTiframeseektime('7023')">1:57:03</a> perfect good being could give us bad

<a onclick="modifyYTiframeseektime('7032')">1:57:12</a> Doctorow do you have two minutes yeah I  
<a onclick="modifyYTiframeseektime('7034')">1:57:14</a> don't recall saying bad things I have to  
<a onclick="modifyYTiframeseektime('7037')">1:57:17</a> take a look at the clip I did  
<a onclick="modifyYTiframeseektime('7039')">1:57:19</a> acknowledge that there all I said there  
<a onclick="modifyYTiframeseektime('7041')">1:57:21</a> are all sorts of things in the in the  
<a onclick="modifyYTiframeseektime('7043')">1:57:23</a> Bible that bother me  
<a onclick="modifyYTiframeseektime('7044')">1:57:24</a> I do recall saying that and what I mean  
<a onclick="modifyYTiframeseektime('7047')">1:57:27</a> by that is I'm a philosopher I'm a  
<a onclick="modifyYTiframeseektime('7049')">1:57:29</a> former atheist when and this would go  
<a onclick="modifyYTiframeseektime('7052')">1:57:32</a> for the Quran as well when when you know  
<a onclick="modifyYTiframeseektime('7054')">1:57:34</a> things in passages talking about Hell or  
<a onclick="modifyYTiframeseektime('7057')">1:57:37</a> something like that eternal torment or  
<a onclick="modifyYTiframeseektime('7059')">1:57:39</a> warfare or something like that  
<a onclick="modifyYTiframeseektime('7061')">1:57:41</a> those things bother me that doesn't mean  
<a onclick="modifyYTiframeseektime('7064')">1:57:44</a> I reject that they're from God actually  
<a onclick="modifyYTiframeseektime('7065')">1:57:45</a> okay those are something I've noticed a  
<a onclick="modifyYTiframeseektime('7067')">1:57:47</a> mindset in Islam that if you accept  
<a onclick="modifyYTiframeseektime('7069')">1:57:49</a> Islam you you can never really think  
<a onclick="modifyYTiframeseektime('7072')">1:57:52</a> critically about it and I can't I can't  
<a onclick="modifyYTiframeseektime('7076')">1:57:56</a> be like that  
<a onclick="modifyYTiframeseektime('7076')">1:57:56</a> so always I'm always wrestling with  
<a onclick="modifyYTiframeseektime('7079')">1:57:59</a> issues Old Testament and New Testament  
<a onclick="modifyYTiframeseektime('7082')">1:58:02</a> and with the Quran as well so as far as  
<a onclick="modifyYTiframeseektime('7084')">1:58:04</a> as far as them the moral case if we're  
<a onclick="modifyYTiframeseektime('7088')">1:58:08</a> talking about  
<a onclick="modifyYTiframeseektime('7090')">1:58:10</a> Old Testament passages looking at those  
<a onclick="modifyYTiframeseektime('7091')">1:58:11</a> things yeah I would say these things are  
<a onclick="modifyYTiframeseektime('7093')">1:58:13</a> these things they're you know the one  
<a onclick="modifyYTiframeseektime('7096')">1:58:16</a> minute left entering the land of Canaan  
<a onclick="modifyYTiframeseektime('7098')">1:58:18</a> and fighting the Canaanites and so on  
<a onclick="modifyYTiframeseektime('7099')">1:58:19</a> those things those things they make me  
<a onclick="modifyYTiframeseektime('7101')">1:58:21</a> wonder sometimes but if you believe that  
<a onclick="modifyYTiframeseektime('7105')">1:58:25</a> Jesus rose from the dead then you have  
<a onclick="modifyYTiframeseektime('7108')">1:58:28</a> to say okay if Jesus rose from the dead  
<a onclick="modifyYTiframeseektime('7109')">1:58:29</a> then if I'm going to listen to anyone  
<a onclick="modifyYTiframeseektime('7111')">1:58:31</a> tell me about God I'm going to listen to  
<a onclick="modifyYTiframeseektime('7114')">1:58:34</a> Jesus and so if he's Lord then hey if  
<a onclick="modifyYTiframeseektime('7118')">1:58:38</a> something bothers me that's my problem  
<a onclick="modifyYTiframeseektime('7119')">1:58:39</a> right that's my problem that's something  
<a onclick="modifyYTiframeseektime('7121')">1:58:41</a> I have to wrestle with God accepts that  
<a onclick="modifyYTiframeseektime('7123')">1:58:43</a> we have to wrestle with think the Psalms  
<a onclick="modifyYTiframeseektime('7124')">1:58:44</a> are filled with people really really  
<a onclick="modifyYTiframeseektime('7126')">1:58:46</a> wondering why certain things are  
<a onclick="modifyYTiframeseektime('7128')">1:58:48</a> happening and I don't think that's a bad  
<a onclick="modifyYTiframeseektime('7130')">1:58:50</a> thing and I don't think God thinks it's  
<a onclick="modifyYTiframeseektime('7131')">1:58:51</a> a bad thing when we look at something  
<a onclick="modifyYTiframeseektime('7133')">1:58:53</a> and go wow that's really rough now I  
<a onclick="modifyYTiframeseektime('7135')">1:58:55</a> really want to I really want to think  
<a onclick="modifyYTiframeseektime('7136')">1:58:56</a> about that so I don't see there's any  
<a onclick="modifyYTiframeseektime('7138')">1:58:58</a> big problem if something bothers me but  
<a onclick="modifyYTiframeseektime('7140')">1:59:00</a> I'm convinced that I have good reasons  
<a onclick="modifyYTiframeseektime('7143')">1:59:03</a> to believe in Christianity then 10  
<a onclick="modifyYTiframeseektime('7144')">1:59:04</a> seconds I don't really see the problem  
<a onclick="modifyYTiframeseektime('7146')">1:59:06</a> and that's why I would still accept it  
<a onclick="modifyYTiframeseektime('7149')">1:59:09</a> because Jesus rose from the dead thank  
<a onclick="modifyYTiframeseektime('7153')">1:59:13</a> you doctor would  
<a onclick="modifyYTiframeseektime('7155')">1:59:15</a> you may ask your fourth question yes in  
<a onclick="modifyYTiframeseektime('7161')">1:59:21</a> the hadith I'm wondering because when  
<a onclick="modifyYTiframeseektime('7164')">1:59:24</a> Allah says however you want to translate  
<a onclick="modifyYTiframeseektime('7167')">1:59:27</a> it he says he prays and the angels pray  
<a onclick="modifyYTiframeseektime('7171')">1:59:31</a> therefore you pray it's like he's  
<a onclick="modifyYTiframeseektime('7172')">1:59:32</a> setting himself up as a model so however  
<a onclick="modifyYTiframeseektime('7174')">1:59:34</a> you want to translate that that's not  
<a onclick="modifyYTiframeseektime('7175')">1:59:35</a> fun I'm not talking about that but he's  
<a onclick="modifyYTiframeseektime('7177')">1:59:37</a> setting himself up as a kind of model  
<a onclick="modifyYTiframeseektime('7178')">1:59:38</a> for behavior but in hadith we read  
<a onclick="modifyYTiframeseektime('7180')">1:59:40</a> Muhammad's saying that if you swear  
<a onclick="modifyYTiframeseektime('7184')">1:59:44</a> about Heidi's yeah it was questioned  
<a onclick="modifyYTiframeseektime('7186')">1:59:46</a> yeah if you swear by anything other than  
<a onclick="modifyYTiframeseektime('7189')">1:59:49</a> Allah you're committing shirk and  
<a onclick="modifyYTiframeseektime('7191')">1:59:51</a> setting it up as a partner with Allah so  
<a onclick="modifyYTiframeseektime('7193')">1:59:53</a> if Muhammad says that swearing by  
<a onclick="modifyYTiframeseektime('7195')">1:59:55</a> anything is committing shirk and in the  
<a onclick="modifyYTiframeseektime('7197')">1:59:57</a> Quran Allah swears by literally  
<a onclick="modifyYTiframeseektime('7199')">1:59:59</a> everything he swears by all kinds of  
<a onclick="modifyYTiframeseektime('7201')">2:00:01</a> things and then says he swears by the  
<a onclick="modifyYTiframeseektime('7202')">2:00:02</a> seen and the unseen then if Muhammad  
<a onclick="modifyYTiframeseektime('7206')">2:00:06</a> says doing this is shirk and Allah then  
<a onclick="modifyYTiframeseektime('7209')">2:00:09</a> does it with literally everything  
<a onclick="modifyYTiframeseektime('7211')">2:00:11</a> doesn't this sound more like pantheism  
<a onclick="modifyYTiframeseektime('7214')">2:00:14</a> then if everything is set up with a  
<a onclick="modifyYTiframeseektime('7217')">2:00:17</a> partner as a partner with Allah so it's  
<a onclick="modifyYTiframeseektime('7219')">2:00:19</a> mainly about what sort of things Allah  
<a onclick="modifyYTiframeseektime('7221')">2:00:21</a> has to do when Muhammad lays down rules  
<a onclick="modifyYTiframeseektime('7222')">2:00:22</a> like that  
<a onclick="modifyYTiframeseektime('7223')">2:00:23</a> you have two minutes thank you by  
<a onclick="modifyYTiframeseektime('7228')">2:00:28</a> definition can only be done by other  
<a onclick="modifyYTiframeseektime('7231')">2:00:31</a> than Allah by definition  
<a onclick="modifyYTiframeseektime('7237')">2:00:37</a> because it means associating  
<a onclick="modifyYTiframeseektime('7240')">2:00:40</a> partners with allah that's what that's  
<a onclick="modifyYTiframeseektime('7244')">2:00:44</a> what shirk is associating partners with  
<a onclick="modifyYTiframeseektime('7246')">2:00:46</a> Allah so Allah can not it's not within a  
<a onclick="modifyYTiframeseektime('7250')">2:00:50</a> lot of attributes to do it's not  
<a onclick="modifyYTiframeseektime('7253')">2:00:53</a> possible that's not a possibility right  
<a onclick="modifyYTiframeseektime('7255')">2:00:55</a> so the question that you ask is about  
<a onclick="modifyYTiframeseektime('7258')">2:00:58</a> how comes Allah a person will be had and  
<a onclick="modifyYTiframeseektime('7261')">2:01:01</a> valid levels may be either always in the  
<a onclick="modifyYTiframeseektime('7263')">2:01:03</a> world fedorov and all this  
<a onclick="modifyYTiframeseektime('7264')">2:01:04</a> he makes cool Qasim he does always in  
<a onclick="modifyYTiframeseektime('7267')">2:01:07</a> the Quran well Allah even doesn't offer  
<a onclick="modifyYTiframeseektime('7270')">2:01:10</a> himself a fellow Arabic a layman who now  
<a onclick="modifyYTiframeseektime('7274')">2:01:14</a> had to hack him or give him a shot  
<a onclick="modifyYTiframeseektime('7275')">2:01:15</a> Saravanan so the point is why does Allah  
<a onclick="modifyYTiframeseektime('7279')">2:01:19</a> have the ability to do to make an oath  
<a onclick="modifyYTiframeseektime('7281')">2:01:21</a> with anything he wants and we can only  
<a onclick="modifyYTiframeseektime('7284')">2:01:24</a> make an oath with Allah because Allah  
<a onclick="modifyYTiframeseektime('7286')">2:01:26</a> owns everything  
<a onclick="modifyYTiframeseektime('7287')">2:01:27</a> one minute land to allah we belong this  
<a onclick="modifyYTiframeseektime('7290')">2:01:30</a> is the reality yes oh and the scholars  
<a onclick="modifyYTiframeseektime('7293')">2:01:33</a> say and the scholars say whatever Allah  
<a onclick="modifyYTiframeseektime('7296')">2:01:36</a> makes an oath off that becomes weaker  
<a onclick="modifyYTiframeseektime('7298')">2:01:38</a> more album chillon it becomes an  
<a onclick="modifyYTiframeseektime('7300')">2:01:40</a> important thing in the Sharia okay now  
<a onclick="modifyYTiframeseektime('7303')">2:01:43</a> really and truly just to because some  
<a onclick="modifyYTiframeseektime('7305')">2:01:45</a> Muslims might be confused with is it  
<a onclick="modifyYTiframeseektime('7307')">2:01:47</a> true that if someone does custom with  
<a onclick="modifyYTiframeseektime('7309')">2:01:49</a> other than Allah that they've committed  
<a onclick="modifyYTiframeseektime('7311')">2:01:51</a> major this is not the view of the  
<a onclick="modifyYTiframeseektime('7314')">2:01:54</a> majority of scholars alright so they say  
<a onclick="modifyYTiframeseektime('7315')">2:01:55</a> that this is a minor kind of just  
<a onclick="modifyYTiframeseektime('7317')">2:01:57</a> for the filthy things don't make takfeer  
<a onclick="modifyYTiframeseektime('7320')">2:02:00</a> of your friends are saying or my mom's  
<a onclick="modifyYTiframeseektime('7322')">2:02:02</a> life yes don't do next communication of  
<a onclick="modifyYTiframeseektime('7324')">2:02:04</a> them so that hopefully answers your  
<a onclick="modifyYTiframeseektime('7326')">2:02:06</a> question thank you you may ask your  
<a onclick="modifyYTiframeseektime('7332')">2:02:12</a> first question oh yes this is really  
<a onclick="modifyYTiframeseektime('7336')">2:02:16</a> interesting to follow up from what you  
<a onclick="modifyYTiframeseektime('7338')">2:02:18</a> said before because it seems to me that  
<a onclick="modifyYTiframeseektime('7340')">2:02:20</a> it was not a satisfactory answer you  
<a onclick="modifyYTiframeseektime('7342')">2:02:22</a> were saying that you were wrestling with  
<a onclick="modifyYTiframeseektime('7344')">2:02:24</a> with these things in the Bible wrestling  
<a onclick="modifyYTiframeseektime('7347')">2:02:27</a> grappling in your mind about these  
<a onclick="modifyYTiframeseektime('7348')">2:02:28</a> things in the Bible in the Old Testament  
<a onclick="modifyYTiframeseektime('7350')">2:02:30</a> you seem to think that morality yes can  
<a onclick="modifyYTiframeseektime('7356')">2:02:36</a> be achieved you're a philosopher yes  
<a onclick="modifyYTiframeseektime('7359')">2:02:39</a> can be achieved from other than an  
<a onclick="modifyYTiframeseektime('7362')">2:02:42</a> objective law it is your suggestion that  
<a onclick="modifyYTiframeseektime('7363')">2:02:43</a> an objective morality can be achieved  
<a onclick="modifyYTiframeseektime('7365')">2:02:45</a> from other than the objective law so I  
<a onclick="modifyYTiframeseektime('7370')">2:02:50</a> want to understand as a are you a divine  
<a onclick="modifyYTiframeseektime('7374')">2:02:54</a> command theorists do you believe that  
<a onclick="modifyYTiframeseektime('7375')">2:02:55</a> the injunctions of God must be perfect  
<a onclick="modifyYTiframeseektime('7380')">2:03:00</a> and if if you do believe this how can  
<a onclick="modifyYTiframeseektime('7382')">2:03:02</a> you explain and you did say bad it can  
<a onclick="modifyYTiframeseektime('7385')">2:03:05</a> easily be retrieved on the ins and I  
<a onclick="modifyYTiframeseektime('7386')">2:03:06</a> listened to it just yesterday you said  
<a onclick="modifyYTiframeseektime('7388')">2:03:08</a> the Old Testament has bad things in it  
<a onclick="modifyYTiframeseektime('7390')">2:03:10</a> you said this yes how can you explain  
<a onclick="modifyYTiframeseektime('7392')">2:03:12</a> that a maximally perfect good God at one  
<a onclick="modifyYTiframeseektime('7399')">2:03:19</a> point and time put forward injunctions  
<a onclick="modifyYTiframeseektime('7405')">2:03:25</a> which could be bad or which otherwise  
<a onclick="modifyYTiframeseektime('7407')">2:03:27</a> bother you can you explain them I have  
<a onclick="modifyYTiframeseektime('7413')">2:03:33</a> two minutes doctor would oh

<a onclick="modifyYTiframeseektime('7452')">2:04:12</a> understand in a Trinitarian it makes no  
<a onclick="modifyYTiframeseektime('7454')">2:04:14</a> sense for God to be loved from all  
<a onclick="modifyYTiframeseektime('7457')">2:04:17</a> eternity but in the light of the  
<a onclick="modifyYTiframeseektime('7461')">2:04:21</a> doctrine of the Trinity with Father Son  
<a onclick="modifyYTiframeseektime('7462')">2:04:22</a> and Holy Spirit now we can see how God  
<a onclick="modifyYTiframeseektime('7464')">2:04:24</a> can be loved from all eternity not just  
<a onclick="modifyYTiframeseektime('7466')">2:04:26</a> not just one person within God so if  
<a onclick="modifyYTiframeseektime('7471')">2:04:31</a> Jesus says that if we're told that that  
<a onclick="modifyYTiframeseektime('7474')">2:04:34</a> God loves everyone left that we are to  
<a onclick="modifyYTiframeseektime('7478')">2:04:38</a> love everyone that we are to harm no one  
<a onclick="modifyYTiframeseektime('7481')">2:04:41</a> that we are to seek peace with everyone  
<a onclick="modifyYTiframeseektime('7484')">2:04:44</a> we're told these then I have to obey  
<a onclick="modifyYTiframeseektime('7487')">2:04:47</a> these kinds of things and so the  
<a onclick="modifyYTiframeseektime('7490')">2:04:50</a> difficult part the  
<a onclick="modifyYTiframeseektime('7492')">2:04:52</a> part then becomes what would I do about  
<a onclick="modifyYTiframeseektime('7495')">2:04:55</a> these Wars and so on given what I now  
<a onclick="modifyYTiframeseektime('7497')">2:04:57</a> believe about God and so that's where  
<a onclick="modifyYTiframeseektime('7500')">2:05:00</a> the struggle comes in  
<a onclick="modifyYTiframeseektime('7501')">2:05:01</a> fortunately the bible does deal with  
<a onclick="modifyYTiframeseektime('7503')">2:05:03</a> that right jesus says Jesus says Moses  
<a onclick="modifyYTiframeseektime('7506')">2:05:06</a> allowed divorce in these certain in  
<a onclick="modifyYTiframeseektime('7508')">2:05:08</a> these circumstances because of the  
<a onclick="modifyYTiframeseektime('7510')">2:05:10</a> hardness of your heart but from the  
<a onclick="modifyYTiframeseektime('7512')">2:05:12</a> beginning it was not so now look at what  
<a onclick="modifyYTiframeseektime('7514')">2:05:14</a> he said here this is not the will of God  
<a onclick="modifyYTiframeseektime('7516')">2:05:16</a> God is allowing certain things at  
<a onclick="modifyYTiframeseektime('7518')">2:05:18</a> certain times because of the hardness of  
<a onclick="modifyYTiframeseektime('7520')">2:05:20</a> your heart  
<a onclick="modifyYTiframeseektime('7520')">2:05:20</a> so even according to the Bible that is  
<a onclick="modifyYTiframeseektime('7523')">2:05:23</a> not the ideal situation that is not in  
<a onclick="modifyYTiframeseektime('7525')">2:05:25</a> solids will for Humanity God looks down  
<a onclick="modifyYTiframeseektime('7527')">2:05:27</a> and sees a world of sinners and then has  
<a onclick="modifyYTiframeseektime('7532')">2:05:32</a> to deal with that right and it's not  
<a onclick="modifyYTiframeseektime('7534')">2:05:34</a> always it's not always going to be  
<a onclick="modifyYTiframeseektime('7535')">2:05:35</a> pretty but the New Testament affirms  
<a onclick="modifyYTiframeseektime('7537')">2:05:37</a> that the the situations in the Old  
<a onclick="modifyYTiframeseektime('7539')">2:05:39</a> Testament were not always ideal thank  
<a onclick="modifyYTiframeseektime('7541')">2:05:41</a> you doctor would you may ask your fifth

<a onclick="modifyYTiframeseektime('7553')">2:05:53</a> Quran Allah says that he aided the true

<a onclick="modifyYTiframeseektime('7562')">2:06:02</a> interpret that in different ways  
<a onclick="modifyYTiframeseektime('7563')">2:06:03</a> commentators such as Yusuf Ali  
<a onclick="modifyYTiframeseektime('7564')">2:06:04</a> interpreted it specifically to mean that

<a onclick="modifyYTiframeseektime('7576')">2:06:16</a> than the Jews who rejected Jesus but we  
<a onclick="modifyYTiframeseektime('7579')">2:06:19</a> know that the Christianity that took

<a onclick="modifyYTiframeseektime('7702')">2:08:22</a> render heretical the earlier people we

<a onclick="modifyYTiframeseektime('7708')">2:08:28</a> and then they became worse as it goes on  
<a onclick="modifyYTiframeseektime('7710')">2:08:30</a> you as Christians believe in the

<a onclick="modifyYTiframeseektime('7721')">2:08:41</a> sixth and final question related to this  
<a onclick="modifyYTiframeseektime('7724')">2:08:44</a> I want to just ask this question one  
<a onclick="modifyYTiframeseektime('7728')">2:08:48</a> last time because I've given him many  
<a onclick="modifyYTiframeseektime('7730')">2:08:50</a> times in this debate an opportunity to  
<a onclick="modifyYTiframeseektime('7732')">2:08:52</a> ask this question okay my question is  
<a onclick="modifyYTiframeseektime('7735')">2:08:55</a> simple I appreciate that  
<a onclick="modifyYTiframeseektime('7738')">2:08:58</a> early church fathers believed that Jesus  
<a onclick="modifyYTiframeseektime('7742')">2:09:02</a> was God some of them did believe that  
<a onclick="modifyYTiframeseektime('7744')">2:09:04</a> some of them believed he was God but not  
<a onclick="modifyYTiframeseektime('7746')">2:09:06</a> co-equal that he was in a hierarchy some  
<a onclick="modifyYTiframeseektime('7749')">2:09:09</a> of them believed he was God but not in  
<a onclick="modifyYTiframeseektime('7752')">2:09:12</a> the same level as like subordination ISM  
<a onclick="modifyYTiframeseektime('7753')">2:09:13</a> right I am asking a question if they  
<a onclick="modifyYTiframeseektime('7758')">2:09:18</a> could designate Jesus as God's co-equal  
<a onclick="modifyYTiframeseektime('7762')">2:09:22</a> and coeternal and they used that  
<a onclick="modifyYTiframeseektime('7765')">2:09:25</a> language respective to Jesus can you  
<a onclick="modifyYTiframeseektime('7768')">2:09:28</a> give me one person who has interpreted  
<a onclick="modifyYTiframeseektime('7770')">2:09:30</a> the New Testament yeah for in the first  
<a onclick="modifyYTiframeseektime('7773')">2:09:33</a> 300 years who has said the same thing  
<a onclick="modifyYTiframeseektime('7777')">2:09:37</a> about the Holy Spirit because if you  
<a onclick="modifyYTiframeseektime('7780')">2:09:40</a> cannot the frank truth is you have a  
<a onclick="modifyYTiframeseektime('7783')">2:09:43</a> baseless foundation for your belief for  
<a onclick="modifyYTiframeseektime('7786')">2:09:46</a> 300 years people would have been the  
<a onclick="modifyYTiframeseektime('7788')">2:09:48</a> farmer as you know what the farmer the  
<a onclick="modifyYTiframeseektime('7790')">2:09:50</a> fisherman the you know the butcher the  
<a onclick="modifyYTiframeseektime('7793')">2:09:53</a> teacher all of those individuals are  
<a onclick="modifyYTiframeseektime('7795')">2:09:55</a> damned to hell  
<a onclick="modifyYTiframeseektime('7796')">2:09:56</a> despite the fact that they had the  
<a onclick="modifyYTiframeseektime('7798')">2:09:58</a> Gospels in front of them because they  
<a onclick="modifyYTiframeseektime('7801')">2:10:01</a> couldn't make the natural inference of  
<a onclick="modifyYTiframeseektime('7802')">2:10:02</a> the Holy Spirit being God can you give  
<a onclick="modifyYTiframeseektime('7804')">2:10:04</a> me one person church father first 300  
<a onclick="modifyYTiframeseektime('7807')">2:10:07</a> years who designated the Holy Spirit as  
<a onclick="modifyYTiframeseektime('7811')">2:10:11</a> co-equal Co eternal independent the same  
<a onclick="modifyYTiframeseektime('7815')">2:10:15</a> language that they use in Nicaea for the  
<a onclick="modifyYTiframeseektime('7817')">2:10:17</a> Holy Spirit please do so  
<a onclick="modifyYTiframeseektime('7823')">2:10:23</a> I'm shocked that people still take this  
<a onclick="modifyYTiframeseektime('7825')">2:10:25</a> here who called the Holy Spirit Khoa  
<a onclick="modifyYTiframeseektime('7827')">2:10:27</a> turned the Bible calls him eternal the  
<a onclick="modifyYTiframeseektime('7831')">2:10:31</a> Bible calls him eternal that language  
<a onclick="modifyYTiframeseektime('7837')">2:10:37</a> that specifically he he said here's a  
<a onclick="modifyYTiframeseektime('7840')">2:10:40</a> counsel in the fourth century that came  
<a onclick="modifyYTiframeseektime('7841')">2:10:41</a> up with a specific way of phrasing  
<a onclick="modifyYTiframeseektime('7844')">2:10:44</a> things  
<a onclick="modifyYTiframeseektime('7845')">2:10:45</a> well that was to help people avoid  
<a onclick="modifyYTiframeseektime('7846')">2:10:46</a> confusion here so if we're saying that  
<a onclick="modifyYTiframeseektime('7850')">2:10:50</a> the Holy Spirit is God father is God the  
<a onclick="modifyYTiframeseektime('7853')">2:10:53</a> Son is God if this is revealed in  
<a onclick="modifyYTiframeseektime('7856')">2:10:56</a> Scripture there's only one God guess  
<a onclick="modifyYTiframeseektime('7857')">2:10:57</a> what that's what they were believing  
<a onclick="modifyYTiframeseektime('7859')">2:10:59</a> time if someone objects at some point  
<a onclick="modifyYTiframeseektime('7862')">2:11:02</a> and says I believe that the Holy Spirit  
<a onclick="modifyYTiframeseektime('7865')">2:11:05</a> is not eternal well then in your Creed  
<a onclick="modifyYTiframeseektime('7868')">2:11:08</a> you need to clarify hey this guy doesn't  
<a onclick="modifyYTiframeseektime('7871')">2:11:11</a> know what he's talking about the Bible  
<a onclick="modifyYTiframeseektime('7872')">2:11:12</a> says that he's eternal  
<a onclick="modifyYTiframeseektime('7873')">2:11:13</a> so he's Co eternal with the father and  
<a onclick="modifyYTiframeseektime('7876')">2:11:16</a> so they put it in a Creed just to be  
<a onclick="modifyYTiframeseektime('7879')">2:11:19</a> clicked Creed's have no authority beyond  
<a onclick="modifyYTiframeseektime('7881')">2:11:21</a> the scripture one minute left  
<a onclick="modifyYTiframeseektime('7884')">2:11:24</a> there's this scripture but it's a lot  
<a onclick="modifyYTiframeseektime('7887')">2:11:27</a> it's 66 books covers 1500 years 40  
<a onclick="modifyYTiframeseektime('7892')">2:11:32</a> different authors right there are  
<a onclick="modifyYTiframeseektime('7894')">2:11:34</a> threads running throughout the scripture  
<a onclick="modifyYTiframeseektime('7897')">2:11:37</a> right the purpose of the Creed is to say  
<a onclick="modifyYTiframeseektime('7899')">2:11:39</a> here's a little short list of the  
<a onclick="modifyYTiframeseektime('7901')">2:11:41</a> essentials here's a short list of the  
<a onclick="modifyYTiframeseektime('7904')">2:11:44</a> essentials to make sure that you're on  
<a onclick="modifyYTiframeseektime('7905')">2:11:45</a> the right side of being an Orthodox  
<a onclick="modifyYTiframeseektime('7908')">2:11:48</a> Christian and so I put a little Creed  
<a onclick="modifyYTiframeseektime('7911')">2:11:51</a> there just because Oh so-and-so is  
<a onclick="modifyYTiframeseektime('7913')">2:11:53</a> coming to a different position and he's  
<a onclick="modifyYTiframeseektime('7914')">2:11:54</a> contradicting the Bible therefore we  
<a onclick="modifyYTiframeseektime('7916')">2:11:56</a> need to make we need to make sure we  
<a onclick="modifyYTiframeseektime('7917')">2:11:57</a> mentioned Co eternal here right but the  
<a onclick="modifyYTiframeseektime('7920')">2:12:00</a> Co eternal does not come from the  
<a onclick="modifyYTiframeseektime('7922')">2:12:02</a> counsel the co eternal comes from the  
<a onclick="modifyYTiframeseektime('7924')">2:12:04</a> Bible right and all of the claims about  
<a onclick="modifyYTiframeseektime('7926')">2:12:06</a> the Equality of the Father the Son and  
<a onclick="modifyYTiframeseektime('7929')">2:12:09</a> the Holy Spirit those come from the  
<a onclick="modifyYTiframeseektime('7931')">2:12:11</a> scripture acknowledging them all as  
<a onclick="modifyYTiframeseektime('7933')">2:12:13</a> Yahweh sin seconds and so you're  
<a onclick="modifyYTiframeseektime('7937')">2:12:17</a> basically saying hey why are you using  
<a onclick="modifyYTiframeseektime('7938')">2:12:18</a> language of clarification later on that  
<a onclick="modifyYTiframeseektime('7941')">2:12:21</a> you didn't use earlier  
<a onclick="modifyYTiframeseektime('7942')">2:12:22</a> well the earlier people have said we  
<a onclick="modifyYTiframeseektime('7945')">2:12:25</a> and he's God so before we start our QA  
<a onclick="modifyYTiframeseektime('7955')">2:12:35</a> each speaker will have five minutes for  
<a onclick="modifyYTiframeseektime('7957')">2:12:37</a> that inclusions anyway he started why  
<a onclick="modifyYTiframeseektime('7959')">2:12:39</a> shouldn't I  
<a onclick="modifyYTiframeseektime('7960')">2:12:40</a> what's that no no I mean he started with  
<a onclick="modifyYTiframeseektime('7963')">2:12:43</a> the question so oh yeah I wasn't  
<a onclick="modifyYTiframeseektime('7966')">2:12:46</a> counting so I wasn't counting but you  
<a onclick="modifyYTiframeseektime('7968')">2:12:48</a> have the six questions there's one final  
<a onclick="modifyYTiframeseektime('7969')">2:12:49</a> question  
<a onclick="modifyYTiframeseektime('7970')">2:12:50</a> okay this is kind of a side issue but I  
<a onclick="modifyYTiframeseektime('7973')">2:12:53</a> was wondering about it because uh  
<a onclick="modifyYTiframeseektime('7975')">2:12:55</a> Mohammed you mentioned the Ebionites as  
<a onclick="modifyYTiframeseektime('7980')">2:13:00</a> early as an early group who didn't  
<a onclick="modifyYTiframeseektime('7984')">2:13:04</a> believe in the deity of Christ the  
<a onclick="modifyYTiframeseektime('7986')">2:13:06</a> Ebionites as I understand that we're a  
<a onclick="modifyYTiframeseektime('7989')">2:13:09</a> group they didn't have the Bible they  
<a onclick="modifyYTiframeseektime('7991')">2:13:11</a> only had part of the Gospel of Matthew  
<a onclick="modifyYTiframeseektime('7993')">2:13:13</a> so they had part of the Gospel of  
<a onclick="modifyYTiframeseektime('7996')">2:13:16</a> Matthew and in that part of the Gospel  
<a onclick="modifyYTiframeseektime('7997')">2:13:17</a> of Matthew even have the beginning but  
<a onclick="modifyYTiframeseektime('7999')">2:13:19</a> they also rejected the virgin birth they  
<a onclick="modifyYTiframeseektime('8002')">2:13:22</a> didn't believe that prophets actually  
<a onclick="modifyYTiframeseektime('8004')">2:13:24</a> got revelations from God the prophets  
<a onclick="modifyYTiframeseektime('8005')">2:13:25</a> spoke on their own wisdom so if we're  
<a onclick="modifyYTiframeseektime('8007')">2:13:27</a> taking the Ebionites as the true  
<a onclick="modifyYTiframeseektime('8010')">2:13:30</a> followers of Christ here what we have to  
<a onclick="modifyYTiframeseektime('8012')">2:13:32</a> reject Islam as well okay thank you now  
<a onclick="modifyYTiframeseektime('8018')">2:13:38</a> I've never made the claim that the  
<a onclick="modifyYTiframeseektime('8019')">2:13:39</a> Ebionites are the true followers of  
<a onclick="modifyYTiframeseektime('8020')">2:13:40</a> Christ that's something you have said  
<a onclick="modifyYTiframeseektime('8021')">2:13:41</a> that's not something I've said I've just  
<a onclick="modifyYTiframeseektime('8023')">2:13:43</a> made the point that they had the Islamic  
<a onclick="modifyYTiframeseektime('8025')">2:13:45</a> position on two aspects the non divinity  
<a onclick="modifyYTiframeseektime('8028')">2:13:48</a> of Jesus Christ and the non divinity of  
<a onclick="modifyYTiframeseektime('8029')">2:13:49</a> the Holy Spirit now they didn't have the  
<a onclick="modifyYTiframeseektime('8031')">2:13:51</a> Bible do you know why because they came  
<a onclick="modifyYTiframeseektime('8033')">2:13:53</a> before Jordan  
<a onclick="modifyYTiframeseektime('8034')">2:13:54</a> they came on 70 AD John came 95 AD

<a onclick="modifyYTiframeseektime('8042')">2:14:02</a> I don't know what to say they only had  
<a onclick="modifyYTiframeseektime('8044')">2:14:04</a> the Gospel of Matthew because only Mark  
<a onclick="modifyYTiframeseektime('8046')">2:14:06</a> Matthew and Luke the synoptic Gospels  
<a onclick="modifyYTiframeseektime('8048')">2:14:08</a> were available to them they had those  
<a onclick="modifyYTiframeseektime('8049')">2:14:09</a> synoptic Gospels now the thing is when  
<a onclick="modifyYTiframeseektime('8053')">2:14:13</a> you when you talk about what they

<a onclick="modifyYTiframeseektime('8172')">2:16:12</a> well thank you thank you again a couple  
<a onclick="modifyYTiframeseektime('8175')">2:16:15</a> side notes here who says the Ebionites  
<a onclick="modifyYTiframeseektime('8177')">2:16:17</a> were too early our earliest reference to  
<a onclick="modifyYTiframeseektime('8179')">2:16:19</a> the EB Knights was from 140 of course  
<a onclick="modifyYTiframeseektime('8183')">2:16:23</a> they they they could be earlier but the  
<a onclick="modifyYTiframeseektime('8185')">2:16:25</a> point is these were people who had one  
<a onclick="modifyYTiframeseektime('8188')">2:16:28</a> part of one gospel and there were  
<a onclick="modifyYTiframeseektime('8192')">2:16:32</a> certainly there were certainly the rest  
<a onclick="modifyYTiframeseektime('8193')">2:16:33</a> of the Gospels around during the time  
<a onclick="modifyYTiframeseektime('8196')">2:16:36</a> but they are they're regarded as a  
<a onclick="modifyYTiframeseektime('8198')">2:16:38</a> radical offshoot of Judaism so to lay  
<a onclick="modifyYTiframeseektime('8202')">2:16:42</a> them down as authoritative again these  
<a onclick="modifyYTiframeseektime('8204')">2:16:44</a> are these are guys who didn't believe  
<a onclick="modifyYTiframeseektime('8205')">2:16:45</a> that prophets spoke from God they didn't  
<a onclick="modifyYTiframeseektime('8207')">2:16:47</a> believe in the virgin birth and so on so  
<a onclick="modifyYTiframeseektime('8209')">2:16:49</a> these guys are the closest to the true  
<a onclick="modifyYTiframeseektime('8211')">2:16:51</a> Jesus then we have to reject the Islamic  
<a onclick="modifyYTiframeseektime('8214')">2:16:54</a> Jesus they said no kids it echoes  
<a onclick="modifyYTiframeseektime('8216')">2:16:56</a> eternal now you have to understand what  
<a onclick="modifyYTiframeseektime('8217')">2:16:57</a> what the author of Hebrews is doing  
<a onclick="modifyYTiframeseektime('8220')">2:17:00</a> there he's talking about the  
<a onclick="modifyYTiframeseektime('8221')">2:17:01</a> descriptions right we don't have really  
<a onclick="modifyYTiframeseektime('8224')">2:17:04</a> time to go into this if someone wants to  
<a onclick="modifyYTiframeseektime('8226')">2:17:06</a> bring it up in the Q&A ask about  
<a onclick="modifyYTiframeseektime('8227')">2:17:07</a> Melchizedek when we can actually go what  
<a onclick="modifyYTiframeseektime('8229')">2:17:09</a> he's doing it he was not saying that  
<a onclick="modifyYTiframeseektime('8230')">2:17:10</a> Melchizedek milk acidic is eternal  
<a onclick="modifyYTiframeseektime('8233')">2:17:13</a> certainly not claiming that so and the  
<a onclick="modifyYTiframeseektime('8238')">2:17:18</a> last point just because something is  
<a onclick="modifyYTiframeseektime('8240')">2:17:20</a> called a God in Scripture doesn't mean  
<a onclick="modifyYTiframeseektime('8242')">2:17:22</a> it's a you know it has divine attributes  
<a onclick="modifyYTiframeseektime('8245')">2:17:25</a> as not God yes we understand the term  
<a onclick="modifyYTiframeseektime('8247')">2:17:27</a> they us in the the term Elohim and the  
<a onclick="modifyYTiframeseektime('8249')">2:17:29</a> Old Testament can mean various things  
<a onclick="modifyYTiframeseektime('8251')">2:17:31</a> the question is how are these terms used  
<a onclick="modifyYTiframeseektime('8253')">2:17:33</a> of Jesus how are these terms used of the  
<a onclick="modifyYTiframeseektime('8256')">2:17:36</a> Father how are these terms used of the  
<a onclick="modifyYTiframeseektime('8259')">2:17:39</a> Holy Spirit the Holy Spirit is creating  
<a onclick="modifyYTiframeseektime('8261')">2:17:41</a> the world in the Bible the Holy Spirit  
<a onclick="modifyYTiframeseektime('8264')">2:17:44</a> is eternal in the Bible so they just  
<a onclick="modifyYTiframeseektime('8267')">2:17:47</a> brush that off and say one of the things  
<a onclick="modifyYTiframeseektime('8268')">2:17:48</a> are called gut yeah not in the same not  
<a onclick="modifyYTiframeseektime('8271')">2:17:51</a> in that way right you could say oh those  
<a onclick="modifyYTiframeseektime('8272')">2:17:52</a> are false gods they're you're calling  
<a onclick="modifyYTiframeseektime('8274')">2:17:54</a> them you're saying they're their gods in  
<a onclick="modifyYTiframeseektime('8276')">2:17:56</a> some way you're using the term but  
<a onclick="modifyYTiframeseektime('8278')">2:17:58</a> you're not applying it seriously when we  
<a onclick="modifyYTiframeseektime('8281')">2:18:01</a> have Father Son and Holy Spirit these  
<a onclick="modifyYTiframeseektime('8283')">2:18:03</a> are used seriously of Father Son and  
<a onclick="modifyYTiframeseektime('8288')">2:18:08</a> Holy Spirit so as far as what we have  
<a onclick="modifyYTiframeseektime('8291')">2:18:11</a> what we have tonight again we see in the  
<a onclick="modifyYTiframeseektime('8295')">2:18:15</a> Old Testament we see from the opening  
<a onclick="modifyYTiframeseektime('8298')">2:18:18</a> verses of the book of Genesis and  
<a onclick="modifyYTiframeseektime('8299')">2:18:19</a> throughout the Old Testament various

<a onclick="modifyYTiframeseektime('8304')">2:18:24</a> within the one god Jewish commentators  
<a onclick="modifyYTiframeseektime('8308')">2:18:28</a> have mentioned this modern experts in  
<a onclick="modifyYTiframeseektime('8313')">2:18:33</a> Judaism acknowledged that prior to the  
<a onclick="modifyYTiframeseektime('8316')">2:18:36</a> end of the second century where the

<a onclick="modifyYTiframeseektime('8329')">2:18:49</a> show me where they say co-equal Co  
<a onclick="modifyYTiframeseektime('8331')">2:18:51</a> eternal father son holy snow one's  
<a onclick="modifyYTiframeseektime('8334')">2:18:54</a> claiming they knew that the point was  
<a onclick="modifyYTiframeseektime('8336')">2:18:56</a> you think they had this how he dish  
<a onclick="modifyYTiframeseektime('8339')">2:18:59</a> belief and they just didn't write what  
<a onclick="modifyYTiframeseektime('8342')">2:19:02</a> did what did the scholar say and what do  
<a onclick="modifyYTiframeseektime('8343')">2:19:03</a> various Jewish scholars say that's the  
<a onclick="modifyYTiframeseektime('8346')">2:19:06</a> doctrine that Christians believe in  
<a onclick="modifyYTiframeseektime('8347')">2:19:07</a> would have fit in very comfortably with  
<a onclick="modifyYTiframeseektime('8349')">2:19:09</a> what Jews prior to the second century at  
<a onclick="modifyYTiframeseektime('8352')">2:19:12</a> Finan there would have been nothing  
<a onclick="modifyYTiframeseektime('8353')">2:19:13</a> therefore for a Jew to claim about to  
<a onclick="modifyYTiframeseektime('8356')">2:19:16</a> complain about in terms of theology they  
<a onclick="modifyYTiframeseektime('8358')">2:19:18</a> would reject they wouldn't reject it by  
<a onclick="modifyYTiframeseektime('8359')">2:19:19</a> saying oh that's a confusing doctrine of

<a onclick="modifyYTiframeseektime('8370')">2:19:30</a> and what have we seen on the other side  
<a onclick="modifyYTiframeseektime('8372')">2:19:32</a> right and here's what's interesting  
<a onclick="modifyYTiframeseektime('8374')">2:19:34</a> Christians have a lot of data right we  
<a onclick="modifyYTiframeseektime('8378')">2:19:38</a> have the Old Testament passages we have  
<a onclick="modifyYTiframeseektime('8380')">2:19:40</a> Jesus coming into the world and we see  
<a onclick="modifyYTiframeseektime('8383')">2:19:43</a> the various things that Jesus did and  
<a onclick="modifyYTiframeseektime('8385')">2:19:45</a> the claims he made and since he rises  
<a onclick="modifyYTiframeseektime('8387')">2:19:47</a> from the dead we have to take those  
<a onclick="modifyYTiframeseektime('8388')">2:19:48</a> claims seriously so when he's claiming  
<a onclick="modifyYTiframeseektime('8389')">2:19:49</a> to be the final judge of all mankind  
<a onclick="modifyYTiframeseektime('8391')">2:19:51</a> when he's claiming to be the one who  
<a onclick="modifyYTiframeseektime('8394')">2:19:54</a> raises the dead at the resurrection we  
<a onclick="modifyYTiframeseektime('8397')">2:19:57</a> recognize the kinds of claims that he's  
<a onclick="modifyYTiframeseektime('8399')">2:19:59</a> making and then when we find various  
<a onclick="modifyYTiframeseektime('8401')">2:20:01</a> claims about the Holy Spirit we take  
<a onclick="modifyYTiframeseektime('8402')">2:20:02</a> those seriously and we say all right

<a onclick="modifyYTiframeseektime('8405')">2:20:05</a> we have to take seriously and the only  
<a onclick="modifyYTiframeseektime('8409')">2:20:09</a> way to take it all seriously is with  
<a onclick="modifyYTiframeseektime('8410')">2:20:10</a> something like the doctrine of the

<a onclick="modifyYTiframeseektime('8413')">2:20:13</a> we turn to Islam and we find all kinds  
<a onclick="modifyYTiframeseektime('8417')">2:20:17</a> of things that are just confusing right  
<a onclick="modifyYTiframeseektime('8419')">2:20:19</a> you know I talk about Allah praying and  
<a onclick="modifyYTiframeseektime('8422')">2:20:22</a> it means sending blessings there  
<a onclick="modifyYTiframeseektime('8423')">2:20:23</a> perfectly you say Baraka right we know  
<a onclick="modifyYTiframeseektime('8427')">2:20:27</a> how to say that why does he use the word  
<a onclick="modifyYTiframeseektime('8429')">2:20:29</a> that's prayer so much so confusing so  
<a onclick="modifyYTiframeseektime('8431')">2:20:31</a> confusing that even Muslim translators  
<a onclick="modifyYTiframeseektime('8433')">2:20:33</a> are now translating it as Allah pray

<a onclick="modifyYTiframeseektime('8441')">2:20:41</a> over and over again that you have an

<a onclick="modifyYTiframeseektime('9124')">2:32:04</a> and basically until the next scene the  
<a onclick="modifyYTiframeseektime('9127')">2:32:07</a> cops of night scene there was nothing  
<a onclick="modifyYTiframeseektime('9128')">2:32:08</a> about the Trinity no but no church  
<a onclick="modifyYTiframeseektime('9130')">2:32:10</a> father has said anything between Jesus's

<a onclick="modifyYTiframeseektime('9146')">2:32:26</a> Islam because there was no apostolate  
<a onclick="modifyYTiframeseektime('9148')">2:32:28</a> succession for Islam either so it was

<a onclick="modifyYTiframeseektime('9196')">2:33:16</a> Trinity Trinity there was nothing  
<a onclick="modifyYTiframeseektime('9198')">2:33:18</a> mentioned by the church fathers between

<a onclick="modifyYTiframeseektime('9203')">2:33:23</a> might may seem can you mention one  
<a onclick="modifyYTiframeseektime('9207')">2:33:27</a> person historically who has talked about  
<a onclick="modifyYTiframeseektime('9209')">2:33:29</a> the massive succession of Islam between  
<a onclick="modifyYTiframeseektime('9212')">2:33:32</a> 33 AD and 583 AD when your prophet began  
<a onclick="modifyYTiframeseektime('9217')">2:33:37</a> when my prophet began sorry what I don't

<a onclick="modifyYTiframeseektime('9222')">2:33:42</a> basically asking for a reference from 33

<a onclick="modifyYTiframeseektime('9228')">2:33:48</a> mentioned that the prophecy Islam was  
<a onclick="modifyYTiframeseektime('9230')">2:33:50</a> coming what sorry guys I'm really I'm  
<a onclick="modifyYTiframeseektime('9234')">2:33:54</a> not doing it on purpose the source were

<a onclick="modifyYTiframeseektime('9239')">2:33:59</a> is you're talking about Islam or  
<a onclick="modifyYTiframeseektime('9240')">2:34:00</a> Christianity he's talking about Islam  
<a onclick="modifyYTiframeseektime('9241')">2:34:01</a> okay 33 8 D so if they did not ask me I  
<a onclick="modifyYTiframeseektime('9244')">2:34:04</a> know I know he says it was there  
<a onclick="modifyYTiframeseektime('9246')">2:34:06</a> referenced it's not something to portray  
<a onclick="modifyYTiframeseektime('9248')">2:34:08</a> that would say that Islam is coming okay  
<a onclick="modifyYTiframeseektime('9251')">2:34:11</a> it's landing submission there's a  
<a onclick="modifyYTiframeseektime('9253')">2:34:13</a> reference to that in the Bible John  
<a onclick="modifyYTiframeseektime('9254')">2:34:14</a> chapter 5 verse 30 because it says I  
<a onclick="modifyYTiframeseektime('9256')">2:34:16</a> don't submit myself to my own will but  
<a onclick="modifyYTiframeseektime('9258')">2:34:18</a> to the will of the father that is Islam  
<a onclick="modifyYTiframeseektime('9259')">2:34:19</a> linguistically that's what Islam means  
<a onclick="modifyYTiframeseektime('9261')">2:34:21</a> so that's in the Bible we don't need to  
<a onclick="modifyYTiframeseektime('9263')">2:34:23</a> go to 33 AD  
<a onclick="modifyYTiframeseektime('9264')">2:34:24</a> is out it's alright I mean is that a  
<a onclick="modifyYTiframeseektime('9268')">2:34:28</a> question yeah yeah sorry one more view  
<a onclick="modifyYTiframeseektime('9272')">2:34:32</a> one more time I'm not understanding a  
<a onclick="modifyYTiframeseektime('9273')">2:34:33</a> question you're saying that there's  
<a onclick="modifyYTiframeseektime('9275')">2:34:35</a> there's nothing about the Trinity  
<a onclick="modifyYTiframeseektime('9276')">2:34:36</a> between 33 AD and about the time of the  
<a onclick="modifyYTiframeseektime('9278')">2:34:38</a> Council of Nicaea this is this is talks  
<a onclick="modifyYTiframeseektime('9280')">2:34:40</a> of your argument Oh  
<a onclick="modifyYTiframeseektime('9282')">2:34:42</a> the things you said the most yet but by  
<a onclick="modifyYTiframeseektime('9284')">2:34:44</a> that same definition we have nothing  
<a onclick="modifyYTiframeseektime('9286')">2:34:46</a> between 3380 that speaks anything about  
<a onclick="modifyYTiframeseektime('9288')">2:34:48</a> anything what not anything in the crowd  
<a onclick="modifyYTiframeseektime('9289')">2:34:49</a> but most of the things in the crop or  
<a onclick="modifyYTiframeseektime('9291')">2:34:51</a> Islam yes okay as Muslims we don't  
<a onclick="modifyYTiframeseektime('9297')">2:34:57</a> believe that the Quran was revealed to  
<a onclick="modifyYTiframeseektime('9300')">2:35:00</a> Jesus we believe it was revealed to  
<a onclick="modifyYTiframeseektime('9302')">2:35:02</a> Prophet Muhammad right so obviously the  
<a onclick="modifyYTiframeseektime('9304')">2:35:04</a> Quran because it was not revealed to  
<a onclick="modifyYTiframeseektime('9306')">2:35:06</a> Jesus it would be no reference to it  
<a onclick="modifyYTiframeseektime('9308')">2:35:08</a> because it was a final Testament that  
<a onclick="modifyYTiframeseektime('9309')">2:35:09</a> came afterwards you see so when I made  
<a onclick="modifyYTiframeseektime('9312')">2:35:12</a> my argument I wasn't I did not make the  
<a onclick="modifyYTiframeseektime('9314')">2:35:14</a> argument that the Trinity was not  
<a onclick="modifyYTiframeseektime('9315')">2:35:15</a> mentioned yeah the Trinity was mentioned  
<a onclick="modifyYTiframeseektime('9317')">2:35:17</a> by Tertullian I did I mentioned that I  
<a onclick="modifyYTiframeseektime('9319')">2:35:19</a> mentioned the Nicean Trinity of 381 and  
<a onclick="modifyYTiframeseektime('9323')">2:35:23</a> after that which stipulates very  
<a onclick="modifyYTiframeseektime('9326')">2:35:26</a> specific specific parameters as to what  
<a onclick="modifyYTiframeseektime('9328')">2:35:28</a> the Trinity is and what the Trinity  
<a onclick="modifyYTiframeseektime('9329')">2:35:29</a> isn't that was my argument yes so I  
<a onclick="modifyYTiframeseektime('9332')">2:35:32</a> didn't say the Trinity is not there in  
<a onclick="modifyYTiframeseektime('9334')">2:35:34</a> the first wave of 300 years I said then  
<a onclick="modifyYTiframeseektime('9336')">2:35:36</a> I see in Trinity wasn't there that's  
<a onclick="modifyYTiframeseektime('9338')">2:35:38</a> what it's that my my point was that if  
<a onclick="modifyYTiframeseektime('9341')">2:35:41</a> you don't believe that Jesus is divine  
<a onclick="modifyYTiframeseektime('9342')">2:35:42</a> you don't believe that the Holy Spirit  
<a onclick="modifyYTiframeseektime('9343')">2:35:43</a> is divine like many monarch in it  
<a onclick="modifyYTiframeseektime('9345')">2:35:45</a> morning artists and even eyes didn't  
<a onclick="modifyYTiframeseektime('9348')">2:35:48</a> believe then by definition you believe  
<a onclick="modifyYTiframeseektime('9350')">2:35:50</a> there's only one God worthy of worship  
<a onclick="modifyYTiframeseektime('9351')">2:35:51</a> right and if that if that's what you  
<a onclick="modifyYTiframeseektime('9354')">2:35:54</a> believe then you're a Muslim in a sense  
<a onclick="modifyYTiframeseektime('9355')">2:35:55</a> because you'll submit yourself to one  
<a onclick="modifyYTiframeseektime('9357')">2:35:57</a> God so from that perspective I think the  
<a onclick="modifyYTiframeseektime('9359')">2:35:59</a> case can be made thank you thank you one  
<a onclick="modifyYTiframeseektime('9366')">2:36:06</a> question over there for dr. wood all  
<a onclick="modifyYTiframeseektime('9369')">2:36:09</a> right so can you hear me properly dr.  
<a onclick="modifyYTiframeseektime('9371')">2:36:11</a> wood I just want to make sure a little  
<a onclick="modifyYTiframeseektime('9373')">2:36:13</a> bit all right I don't know if I'm in a  
<a onclick="modifyYTiframeseektime('9374')">2:36:14</a> bad spot that's the only mic I could  
<a onclick="modifyYTiframeseektime('9376')">2:36:16</a> hear really well just loud I might  
<a onclick="modifyYTiframeseektime('9378')">2:36:18</a> better now  
<a onclick="modifyYTiframeseektime('9381')">2:36:21</a> so my question is regarding the equality  
<a onclick="modifyYTiframeseektime('9384')">2:36:24</a> among the Trinity  
<a onclick="modifyYTiframeseektime('9385')">2:36:25</a> so in Matthew 28 verse 18 Jesus says  
<a onclick="modifyYTiframeseektime('9391')">2:36:31</a> that all authority is giving to him and  
<a onclick="modifyYTiframeseektime('9393')">2:36:33</a> on in the heavens and on earth and then  
<a onclick="modifyYTiframeseektime('9395')">2:36:35</a> in John chapter 16 verse 13 and states  
<a onclick="modifyYTiframeseektime('9400')">2:36:40</a> that but when the spirit of truth comes  
<a onclick="modifyYTiframeseektime('9402')">2:36:42</a> he will be he will guide you into all  
<a onclick="modifyYTiframeseektime('9404')">2:36:44</a> truth for he will not speak on his own  
<a onclick="modifyYTiframeseektime('9407')">2:36:47</a> authority but he will speak on what he  
<a onclick="modifyYTiframeseektime('9409')">2:36:49</a> hears so if the Holy Spirit is God why  
<a onclick="modifyYTiframeseektime('9412')">2:36:52</a> doesn't he have any authority to speak  
<a onclick="modifyYTiframeseektime('9414')">2:36:54</a> thank you if you look at if you look at  
<a onclick="modifyYTiframeseektime('9420')">2:37:00</a> how the Gospel of John is using these  
<a onclick="modifyYTiframeseektime('9425')">2:37:05</a> terms it's the the emphasis in these  
<a onclick="modifyYTiframeseektime('9428')">2:37:08</a> passages is not is not that the Holy  
<a onclick="modifyYTiframeseektime('9433')">2:37:13</a> Spirit is not God or that Jesus is not  
<a onclick="modifyYTiframeseektime('9437')">2:37:17</a> God he's trying to show that there they  
<a onclick="modifyYTiframeseektime('9441')">2:37:21</a> are one like in other words in John  
<a onclick="modifyYTiframeseektime('9444')">2:37:24</a> chapter 5 right Muslims love to bring up  
<a onclick="modifyYTiframeseektime('9446')">2:37:26</a> John chapter 5 where Jesus says of my  
<a onclick="modifyYTiframeseektime('9449')">2:37:29</a> own self I can do nothing check-check  
<a onclick="modifyYTiframeseektime('9450')">2:37:30</a> we're good sense of my own self I can do  
<a onclick="modifyYTiframeseektime('9453')">2:37:33</a> nothing they say aha right there which  
<a onclick="modifyYTiframeseektime('9455')">2:37:35</a> is parallel to the spirit doesn't speak  
<a onclick="modifyYTiframeseektime('9458')">2:37:38</a> on his own on his on his own authority  
<a onclick="modifyYTiframeseektime('9460')">2:37:40</a> right if you look at what's actually  
<a onclick="modifyYTiframeseektime('9461')">2:37:41</a> going on there at the beginning of John  
<a onclick="modifyYTiframeseektime('9464')">2:37:44</a> I mean earlier in John chapter 5 because  
<a onclick="modifyYTiframeseektime('9467')">2:37:47</a> Jesus is calling himself the Son and  
<a onclick="modifyYTiframeseektime('9470')">2:37:50</a> saying that he can work on the Sabbath  
<a onclick="modifyYTiframeseektime('9474')">2:37:54</a> because the father does notice Jews are  
<a onclick="modifyYTiframeseektime('9476')">2:37:56</a> not allowed to work on the Sabbath Jesus  
<a onclick="modifyYTiframeseektime('9478')">2:37:58</a> says but the Father works on the Sabbath  
<a onclick="modifyYTiframeseektime('9480')">2:38:00</a> and so do i right when he said that they  
<a onclick="modifyYTiframeseektime('9483')">2:38:03</a> accused him of claiming to be another  
<a onclick="modifyYTiframeseektime('9485')">2:38:05</a> God right he's a rogue deity right he's  
<a onclick="modifyYTiframeseektime('9488')">2:38:08</a> a separate so what he does there and the  
<a onclick="modifyYTiframeseektime('9493')">2:38:13</a> rest of John chapter 5 that's where he  
<a onclick="modifyYTiframeseektime('9495')">2:38:15</a> claims to that he's the one who raises  
<a onclick="modifyYTiframeseektime('9497')">2:38:17</a> the dead at the resurrection he says  
<a onclick="modifyYTiframeseektime('9499')">2:38:19</a> that he's the one who is the final judge  
<a onclick="modifyYTiframeseektime('9502')">2:38:22</a> and he says that we have to honor  
<a onclick="modifyYTiframeseektime('9506')">2:38:26</a> just as we honor the father right so  
<a onclick="modifyYTiframeseektime('9509')">2:38:29</a> keep in mind we have to you would only  
<a onclick="modifyYTiframeseektime('9512')">2:38:32</a> honor someone the same way you honor the  
<a onclick="modifyYTiframeseektime('9514')">2:38:34</a> father if he has the same nature nature  
<a onclick="modifyYTiframeseektime('9516')">2:38:36</a> and attributes as the father so when he  
<a onclick="modifyYTiframeseektime('9518')">2:38:38</a> says when he says that he can do nothing  
<a onclick="modifyYTiframeseektime('9520')">2:38:40</a> of himself or when the holy spirit does  
<a onclick="modifyYTiframeseektime('9522')">2:38:42</a> not not speak on his own authority what  
<a onclick="modifyYTiframeseektime('9525')">2:38:45</a> these are saying is they don't do these  
<a onclick="modifyYTiframeseektime('9528')">2:38:48</a> things separately as separate deities  
<a onclick="modifyYTiframeseektime('9531')">2:38:51</a> from the Father because that's the  
<a onclick="modifyYTiframeseektime('9533')">2:38:53</a> accusation as soon as you start saying  
<a onclick="modifyYTiframeseektime('9534')">2:38:54</a> some things are divine they start  
<a onclick="modifyYTiframeseektime('9536')">2:38:56</a> accusing of saying there's other gods so  
<a onclick="modifyYTiframeseektime('9538')">2:38:58</a> the emphasis is he doesn't do this on

<a onclick="modifyYTiframeseektime('9543')">2:39:03</a> dr. wood we're past the halfway mark  
<a onclick="modifyYTiframeseektime('9545')">2:39:05</a> right now and q8 so we're gonna try to  
<a onclick="modifyYTiframeseektime('9547')">2:39:07</a> speed it up as much as we cancel will  
<a onclick="modifyYTiframeseektime('9549')">2:39:09</a> limit each answer to one minute for both  
<a onclick="modifyYTiframeseektime('9552')">2:39:12</a> speakers so I think the next question is  
<a onclick="modifyYTiframeseektime('9555')">2:39:15</a> for mr. Jeff yes I have a question for  
<a onclick="modifyYTiframeseektime('9558')">2:39:18</a> mr. headshop I was wondering since the  
<a onclick="modifyYTiframeseektime('9560')">2:39:20</a> thrust of your argument hinges on  
<a onclick="modifyYTiframeseektime('9563')">2:39:23</a> David's inexpert flaw knowledge of  
<a onclick="modifyYTiframeseektime('9566')">2:39:26</a> Arabic don't you think it's a little odd  
<a onclick="modifyYTiframeseektime('9568')">2:39:28</a> that the will of God can only be  
<a onclick="modifyYTiframeseektime('9571')">2:39:31</a> discerned by people who speak in it so  
<a onclick="modifyYTiframeseektime('9574')">2:39:34</a> Tarek language spoken by less than 5% of  
<a onclick="modifyYTiframeseektime('9577')">2:39:37</a> the population and which has many  
<a onclick="modifyYTiframeseektime('9581')">2:39:41</a> dialects and isn't even spoken by the  
<a onclick="modifyYTiframeseektime('9584')">2:39:44</a> majority of self-professed Muslims and  
<a onclick="modifyYTiframeseektime('9587')">2:39:47</a> what do you think of the fact that there  
<a onclick="modifyYTiframeseektime('9589')">2:39:49</a> are people who are very learned in  
<a onclick="modifyYTiframeseektime('9591')">2:39:51</a> Arabic who even born in Arabia who have  
<a onclick="modifyYTiframeseektime('9593')">2:39:53</a> the same epistemological moro scientific  
<a onclick="modifyYTiframeseektime('9596')">2:39:56</a> and historical critiques of the quran  
<a onclick="modifyYTiframeseektime('9600')">2:40:00</a> thank you very much  
<a onclick="modifyYTiframeseektime('9602')">2:40:02</a> the question was about the Arabic  
<a onclick="modifyYTiframeseektime('9603')">2:40:03</a> language of the Quran and you were  
<a onclick="modifyYTiframeseektime('9605')">2:40:05</a> saying that is it is it the case that  
<a onclick="modifyYTiframeseektime('9607')">2:40:07</a> only Arabs can access the Quran in a  
<a onclick="modifyYTiframeseektime('9609')">2:40:09</a> nutshell is it why is it the only 5% of  
<a onclick="modifyYTiframeseektime('9611')">2:40:11</a> the population can access this and the  
<a onclick="modifyYTiframeseektime('9613')">2:40:13</a> rest cannot now there's a difference  
<a onclick="modifyYTiframeseektime('9615')">2:40:15</a> between understanding the fundamentals  
<a onclick="modifyYTiframeseektime('9617')">2:40:17</a> of a religion yes and trying to do  
<a onclick="modifyYTiframeseektime('9619')">2:40:19</a> exegesis yes exegesis is when you try  
<a onclick="modifyYTiframeseektime('9623')">2:40:23</a> hermeneutic ly to go into the text and  
<a onclick="modifyYTiframeseektime('9626')">2:40:26</a> understand it holistically and for that  
<a onclick="modifyYTiframeseektime('9630')">2:40:30</a> you require language ability for that  
<a onclick="modifyYTiframeseektime('9634')">2:40:34</a> you require whether you're doing with  
<a onclick="modifyYTiframeseektime('9635')">2:40:35</a> the Bible or the  
<a onclick="modifyYTiframeseektime('9636')">2:40:36</a> you require to have some kind of ability  
<a onclick="modifyYTiframeseektime('9638')">2:40:38</a> to understand the language otherwise  
<a onclick="modifyYTiframeseektime('9640')">2:40:40</a> your hermeneutic will be necessarily  
<a onclick="modifyYTiframeseektime('9642')">2:40:42</a> limited now just quickly as I do have a  
<a onclick="modifyYTiframeseektime('9645')">2:40:45</a> little bit of time answering the  
<a onclick="modifyYTiframeseektime('9647')">2:40:47</a> question or the point on on John that  
<a onclick="modifyYTiframeseektime('9650')">2:40:50</a> that David talked about don't John John  
<a onclick="modifyYTiframeseektime('9653')">2:40:53</a> chapter 10 verse 34 Jesus clearly says  
<a onclick="modifyYTiframeseektime('9656')">2:40:56</a> why did you call me God I mean they were  
<a onclick="modifyYTiframeseektime('9658')">2:40:58</a> about to stone him when he said this and  
<a onclick="modifyYTiframeseektime('9660')">2:41:00</a> he's really is referencing Psalms 82 so  
<a onclick="modifyYTiframeseektime('9663')">2:41:03</a> if you really believe he's God then why  
<a onclick="modifyYTiframeseektime('9664')">2:41:04</a> is he saying didn't didn't you say this  
<a onclick="modifyYTiframeseektime('9668')">2:41:08</a> of old like you are gods  
<a onclick="modifyYTiframeseektime('9670')">2:41:10</a> NUI are gods in other words it's a  
<a onclick="modifyYTiframeseektime('9673')">2:41:13</a> language of the people and that's one of  
<a onclick="modifyYTiframeseektime('9675')">2:41:15</a> the biggest problems serve them sorry  
<a onclick="modifyYTiframeseektime('9677')">2:41:17</a> I'm sorry  
<a onclick="modifyYTiframeseektime('9678')">2:41:18</a> apologies good you can go ahead question  
<a onclick="modifyYTiframeseektime('9682')">2:41:22</a> for dr. wood I have one question for you  
<a onclick="modifyYTiframeseektime('9688')">2:41:28</a> it has three co-equal parts but I assure  
<a onclick="modifyYTiframeseektime('9691')">2:41:31</a> you that it is just one question you try  
<a onclick="modifyYTiframeseektime('9692')">2:41:32</a> to keep it to one we're trying to get as  
<a onclick="modifyYTiframeseektime('9693')">2:41:33</a> much  
<a onclick="modifyYTiframeseektime('9695')">2:41:35</a> three is one  
<a onclick="modifyYTiframeseektime('9706')">2:41:46</a> can I ask it would you agree that the  
<a onclick="modifyYTiframeseektime('9711')">2:41:51</a> concept of the Trinity has evolved over  
<a onclick="modifyYTiframeseektime('9713')">2:41:53</a> time what do you say about Revelation  
<a onclick="modifyYTiframeseektime('9716')">2:41:56</a> chapter 22 verse 18 to 19 where it says  
<a onclick="modifyYTiframeseektime('9719')">2:41:59</a> I warn everyone who hears the word of  
<a onclick="modifyYTiframeseektime('9721')">2:42:01</a> the prophecy of this book if anyone adds  
<a onclick="modifyYTiframeseektime('9724')">2:42:04</a> to them God will add to him the plagues  
<a onclick="modifyYTiframeseektime('9727')">2:42:07</a> described in this book is etc etc etc  
<a onclick="modifyYTiframeseektime('9730')">2:42:10</a> and can you explain Matthew chapter 7  
<a onclick="modifyYTiframeseektime('9733')">2:42:13</a> verses 21 to 23 where Jesus says I never  
<a onclick="modifyYTiframeseektime('9736')">2:42:16</a> knew I never knew you get away from me  
<a onclick="modifyYTiframeseektime('9740')">2:42:20</a> well there he says not everyone who says  
<a onclick="modifyYTiframeseektime('9743')">2:42:23</a> not everyone who says to me Lord Lord  
<a onclick="modifyYTiframeseektime('9745')">2:42:25</a> will enter the kingdom of heaven but  
<a onclick="modifyYTiframeseektime('9748')">2:42:28</a> only those who do the will of my father  
<a onclick="modifyYTiframeseektime('9750')">2:42:30</a> so he will say I never knew you I don't  
<a onclick="modifyYTiframeseektime('9755')">2:42:35</a> understand what what the problem is  
<a onclick="modifyYTiframeseektime('9757')">2:42:37</a> there Jesus calls himself Lord but he's  
<a onclick="modifyYTiframeseektime('9759')">2:42:39</a> saying not even not you you don't just  
<a onclick="modifyYTiframeseektime('9760')">2:42:40</a> call him Lord and then and then you're  
<a onclick="modifyYTiframeseektime('9762')">2:42:42</a> fine moves the other party what do you  
<a onclick="modifyYTiframeseektime('9765')">2:42:45</a> would you agree that the concept of  
<a onclick="modifyYTiframeseektime('9768')">2:42:48</a> Trinity has evolved over time  
<a onclick="modifyYTiframeseektime('9769')">2:42:49</a> oh no the clarification of the concept  
<a onclick="modifyYTiframeseektime('9771')">2:42:51</a> right keep in mind whether you're  
<a onclick="modifyYTiframeseektime('9774')">2:42:54</a> talking about the Quran whether you're  
<a onclick="modifyYTiframeseektime('9775')">2:42:55</a> talking about the Bible  
<a onclick="modifyYTiframeseektime('9776')">2:42:56</a> you have historical events you have  
<a onclick="modifyYTiframeseektime('9779')">2:42:59</a> revelations from prophets statements and  
<a onclick="modifyYTiframeseektime('9782')">2:43:02</a> so on and if you're coming up with the  
<a onclick="modifyYTiframeseektime('9785')">2:43:05</a> Creed you're trying to clarify it you're  
<a onclick="modifyYTiframeseektime('9788')">2:43:08</a> trying to make it as concise as possible  
<a onclick="modifyYTiframeseektime('9789')">2:43:09</a> so yeah they had to cook they had to  
<a onclick="modifyYTiframeseektime('9793')">2:43:13</a> figure out how to say things in using  
<a onclick="modifyYTiframeseektime('9797')">2:43:17</a> certain terms in language but matryona  
<a onclick="modifyYTiframeseektime('9801')">2:43:21</a> God is eternal right the triune God is  
<a onclick="modifyYTiframeseektime('9803')">2:43:23</a> eternal our our descriptions our  
<a onclick="modifyYTiframeseektime('9806')">2:43:26</a> descriptions may take time but that's  
<a onclick="modifyYTiframeseektime('9808')">2:43:28</a> not it that's not the Trinity evolving  
<a onclick="modifyYTiframeseektime('9811')">2:43:31</a> that's our concepts being clarified and  
<a onclick="modifyYTiframeseektime('9813')">2:43:33</a> what about the third part where I said  
<a onclick="modifyYTiframeseektime('9815')">2:43:35</a> what do you say about revelation chapter  
<a onclick="modifyYTiframeseektime('9817')">2:43:37</a> 22 verse 18 to 19 where it says I want  
<a onclick="modifyYTiframeseektime('9820')">2:43:40</a> everyone who hears the words of the  
<a onclick="modifyYTiframeseektime('9822')">2:43:42</a> prophecy of this book if anyone adds to  
<a onclick="modifyYTiframeseektime('9824')">2:43:44</a> them God will add to him the plagues  
<a onclick="modifyYTiframeseektime('9827')">2:43:47</a> described in this book etc etc well the  
<a onclick="modifyYTiframeseektime('9829')">2:43:49</a> book of Revelation it the author I  
<a onclick="modifyYTiframeseektime('9832')">2:43:52</a> didn't know he's gonna be writing last  
<a onclick="modifyYTiframeseektime('9833')">2:43:53</a> book of the Bible he's talking about his  
<a onclick="modifyYTiframeseektime('9834')">2:43:54</a> prophecy his prophecy in book of  
<a onclick="modifyYTiframeseektime('9835')">2:43:55</a> Revelation don't take my prophecy and  
<a onclick="modifyYTiframeseektime('9837')">2:43:57</a> add a bunch of words to them so he's  
<a onclick="modifyYTiframeseektime('9839')">2:43:59</a> just saying hey don't add to my prophecy  
<a onclick="modifyYTiframeseektime('9840')">2:44:00</a> here and act like it's my prophecy that  
<a onclick="modifyYTiframeseektime('9843')">2:44:03</a> doesn't mean you can't clarify concepts  
<a onclick="modifyYTiframeseektime('9845')">2:44:05</a> right so thank you very much question  
<a onclick="modifyYTiframeseektime('9850')">2:44:10</a> for mr. hijab yes a question for mr.  
<a onclick="modifyYTiframeseektime('9853')">2:44:13</a> David I'm sorry I have question if I  
<a onclick="modifyYTiframeseektime('9855')">2:44:15</a> miss to work for mr. would would have to  
<a onclick="modifyYTiframeseektime('9859')">2:44:19</a> take questions on the surface at first  
<a onclick="modifyYTiframeseektime('9860')">2:44:20</a> anyone wants answer of course go ahead  
<a onclick="modifyYTiframeseektime('9862')">2:44:22</a> Louis up I had a question for you yes  
<a onclick="modifyYTiframeseektime('9866')">2:44:26</a> are you certain that you will be going  
<a onclick="modifyYTiframeseektime('9869')">2:44:29</a> to heaven Janna as according to Islam  
<a onclick="modifyYTiframeseektime('9873')">2:44:33</a> says you yourself no does that concern  
<a onclick="modifyYTiframeseektime('9877')">2:44:37</a> you maybe David will go to heaven and I  
<a onclick="modifyYTiframeseektime('9879')">2:44:39</a> will go to hell that's a possibility you  
<a onclick="modifyYTiframeseektime('9882')">2:44:42</a> know I mean I as a Muslim as a Muslim I  
<a onclick="modifyYTiframeseektime('9885')">2:44:45</a> can't guarantee and you know Christians  
<a onclick="modifyYTiframeseektime('9887')">2:44:47</a> say Christians say that you know God  
<a onclick="modifyYTiframeseektime('9890')">2:44:50</a> this is one of the arguments that you  
<a onclick="modifyYTiframeseektime('9891')">2:44:51</a> can't guarantee you it's off the kingdom  
<a onclick="modifyYTiframeseektime('9893')">2:44:53</a> of heaven yeah yeah that's true that's  
<a onclick="modifyYTiframeseektime('9895')">2:44:55</a> true that what why is that amount to the  
<a onclick="modifyYTiframeseektime('9897')">2:44:57</a> falsity of Islam I mean what logical  
<a onclick="modifyYTiframeseektime('9899')">2:44:59</a> reasoning is that anyways the point is  
<a onclick="modifyYTiframeseektime('9901')">2:45:01</a> say for instance you're a Christian and  
<a onclick="modifyYTiframeseektime('9903')">2:45:03</a> you believe that if you're a Christian  
<a onclick="modifyYTiframeseektime('9905')">2:45:05</a> you're going to go to heaven but even  
<a onclick="modifyYTiframeseektime('9906')">2:45:06</a> according to your own belief system  
<a onclick="modifyYTiframeseektime('9908')">2:45:08</a> there is a possibility a logical  
<a onclick="modifyYTiframeseektime('9910')">2:45:10</a> rational possibility that for instance  
<a onclick="modifyYTiframeseektime('9912')">2:45:12</a> you'll die upon Hinduism or atheism or  
<a onclick="modifyYTiframeseektime('9914')">2:45:14</a> do Judaism and in which case you will  
<a onclick="modifyYTiframeseektime('9916')">2:45:16</a> have to you have to conclude that you  
<a onclick="modifyYTiframeseektime('9918')">2:45:18</a> cannot be perfectly sure that you're  
<a onclick="modifyYTiframeseektime('9921')">2:45:21</a> going to heaven because that would mean  
<a onclick="modifyYTiframeseektime('9923')">2:45:23</a> that you have perfect knowledge of the  
<a onclick="modifyYTiframeseektime('9924')">2:45:24</a> future and not only do you not have that  
<a onclick="modifyYTiframeseektime('9927')">2:45:27</a> perfect knowledge nor not even the Holy  
<a onclick="modifyYTiframeseektime('9929')">2:45:29</a> Spirit had that knowledge oh thank you  
<a onclick="modifyYTiframeseektime('9931')">2:45:31</a> very much mr. head now  
<a onclick="modifyYTiframeseektime('9933')">2:45:33</a> you may ask your question for dr. wood  
<a onclick="modifyYTiframeseektime('9935')">2:45:35</a> are you like yeah he said in the  
<a onclick="modifyYTiframeseektime('9937')">2:45:37</a> beginning that God was in heaven and he  
<a onclick="modifyYTiframeseektime('9941')">2:45:41</a> was his the spirit was hovering of over  
<a onclick="modifyYTiframeseektime('9944')">2:45:44</a> the heaven and it was a mystery and the  
<a onclick="modifyYTiframeseektime('9946')">2:45:46</a> mystery was supposed to be revealed but  
<a onclick="modifyYTiframeseektime('9949')">2:45:49</a> it went on more into dark that mystery  
<a onclick="modifyYTiframeseektime('9952')">2:45:52</a> never got explained if I am if I'm  
<a onclick="modifyYTiframeseektime('9954')">2:45:54</a> pushed towards believing God to be a  
<a onclick="modifyYTiframeseektime('9956')">2:45:56</a> mystery it will be Hinduism when God  
<a onclick="modifyYTiframeseektime('9959')">2:45:59</a> comes through multiple incarnations to  
<a onclick="modifyYTiframeseektime('9961')">2:46:01</a> earth in order to fix people does that  
<a onclick="modifyYTiframeseektime('9965')">2:46:05</a> mean Christianity is a subset of  
<a onclick="modifyYTiframeseektime('9967')">2:46:07</a> Hinduism when he claims Jesus came as a  
<a onclick="modifyYTiframeseektime('9969')">2:46:09</a> incarnation of God  
<a onclick="modifyYTiframeseektime('9974')">2:46:14</a> [Music]  
<a onclick="modifyYTiframeseektime('9985')">2:46:25</a> if in Hinduism it is a common belief  
<a onclick="modifyYTiframeseektime('9988')">2:46:28</a> that God comes as incarnations and I  
<a onclick="modifyYTiframeseektime('9991')">2:46:31</a> suppose you also believe that Jesus came  
<a onclick="modifyYTiframeseektime('9995')">2:46:35</a> as incarnation of God onto the earth to  
<a onclick="modifyYTiframeseektime('9997')">2:46:37</a> fix people and to teach the variety does  
<a onclick="modifyYTiframeseektime('10001')">2:46:41</a> that mean in Christianity is a subset of  
<a onclick="modifyYTiframeseektime('10003')">2:46:43</a> Hinduism in terms of its beliefs no you  
<a onclick="modifyYTiframeseektime('10013')">2:46:53</a> can't say anyone who believes in an  
<a onclick="modifyYTiframeseektime('10014')">2:46:54</a> incarnation is a subset of Hinduism  
<a onclick="modifyYTiframeseektime('10018')">2:46:58</a> if someone who's never heard one single  
<a onclick="modifyYTiframeseektime('10020')">2:47:00</a> thing about Hinduism which would have  
<a onclick="modifyYTiframeseektime('10022')">2:47:02</a> been first century Jews believed in an  
<a onclick="modifyYTiframeseektime('10024')">2:47:04</a> incarnation has nothing has nothing to  
<a onclick="modifyYTiframeseektime('10027')">2:47:07</a> do with with Hinduism just because you  
<a onclick="modifyYTiframeseektime('10030')">2:47:10</a> have some sort of parallel in some way  
<a onclick="modifyYTiframeseektime('10035')">2:47:15</a> like oh but there are many religions  
<a onclick="modifyYTiframeseektime('10037')">2:47:17</a> that believe in rising from the dead  
<a onclick="modifyYTiframeseektime('10039')">2:47:19</a> doesn't mean they all stole it from each  
<a onclick="modifyYTiframeseektime('10040')">2:47:20</a> other so no  
<a onclick="modifyYTiframeseektime('10049')">2:47:29</a> right  
<a onclick="modifyYTiframeseektime('10053')">2:47:33</a> next question for mr. Hodge ah yeah oh  
<a onclick="modifyYTiframeseektime('10057')">2:47:37</a> yeah guys thank you for coming thanks  
<a onclick="modifyYTiframeseektime('10059')">2:47:39</a> Danika Mohammed and yeah so my question  
<a onclick="modifyYTiframeseektime('10062')">2:47:42</a> is like there's a question that Debbie  
<a onclick="modifyYTiframeseektime('10064')">2:47:44</a> dude asked about the fact that the Quran  
<a onclick="modifyYTiframeseektime('10066')">2:47:46</a> says that Bob sorry Oh  
<a onclick="modifyYTiframeseektime('10068')">2:47:48</a> the Quran says that the followers of  
<a onclick="modifyYTiframeseektime('10071')">2:47:51</a> Jesus was supposed to be uppermost and  
<a onclick="modifyYTiframeseektime('10074')">2:47:54</a> so like I was wondering what your  
<a onclick="modifyYTiframeseektime('10076')">2:47:56</a> understanding of that is because I  
<a onclick="modifyYTiframeseektime('10078')">2:47:58</a> thought that them being uppermost would  
<a onclick="modifyYTiframeseektime('10080')">2:48:00</a> be that they're the ones who are going  
<a onclick="modifyYTiframeseektime('10082')">2:48:02</a> to overcome over the disbelievers and so  
<a onclick="modifyYTiframeseektime('10085')">2:48:05</a> we obviously know that Chris the  
<a onclick="modifyYTiframeseektime('10087')">2:48:07</a> Christians who were there during  
<a onclick="modifyYTiframeseektime('10088')">2:48:08</a> Muhammad's time we lived in the Trinity  
<a onclick="modifyYTiframeseektime('10091')">2:48:11</a> and so like I was just wondering what  
<a onclick="modifyYTiframeseektime('10093')">2:48:13</a> happened to Jesus's disciples according  
<a onclick="modifyYTiframeseektime('10096')">2:48:16</a> to Islam and why did they why were they  
<a onclick="modifyYTiframeseektime('10099')">2:48:19</a> not able to counter the faults yes  
<a onclick="modifyYTiframeseektime('10101')">2:48:21</a> disciples well about this Virgil Idina

<a onclick="modifyYTiframeseektime('10108')">2:48:28</a> talking about the Howard Ian it says  
<a onclick="modifyYTiframeseektime('10111')">2:48:31</a> that we're going to make them higher  
<a onclick="modifyYTiframeseektime('10112')">2:48:32</a> than those who have disbelieved until  
<a onclick="modifyYTiframeseektime('10114')">2:48:34</a> the day of judgment yes so it's talking  
<a onclick="modifyYTiframeseektime('10117')">2:48:37</a> about the disciples of Jesus we believe  
<a onclick="modifyYTiframeseektime('10119')">2:48:39</a> that those early Christians were on the  
<a onclick="modifyYTiframeseektime('10122')">2:48:42</a> truth let me repeat the quran says very  
<a onclick="modifyYTiframeseektime('10125')">2:48:45</a> clearly that those Christians will go to  
<a onclick="modifyYTiframeseektime('10127')">2:48:47</a> heaven those Christians will go to  
<a onclick="modifyYTiframeseektime('10129')">2:48:49</a> heaven they believed in Christ they were

<a onclick="modifyYTiframeseektime('10133')">2:48:53</a> etc now there's a difference now as a  
<a onclick="modifyYTiframeseektime('10137')">2:48:57</a> point of demarcation between the early  
<a onclick="modifyYTiframeseektime('10139')">2:48:59</a> Christians the disciples and then the  
<a onclick="modifyYTiframeseektime('10142')">2:49:02</a> Church Fathers and then those who came  
<a onclick="modifyYTiframeseektime('10143')">2:49:03</a> up to those so the point is as Muslims  
<a onclick="modifyYTiframeseektime('10146')">2:49:06</a> our Creed is we believe Jesus was  
<a onclick="modifyYTiframeseektime('10148')">2:49:08</a> innocent of all of this that his

<a onclick="modifyYTiframeseektime('10152')">2:49:12</a> and that he and that they are people who  
<a onclick="modifyYTiframeseektime('10155')">2:49:15</a> are honored in Islam and whoever says

<a onclick="modifyYTiframeseektime('10162')">2:49:22</a> which is very clear it's a clear point

<a onclick="modifyYTiframeseektime('10190')">2:49:50</a> you very much one question for dr. book  
<a onclick="modifyYTiframeseektime('10195')">2:49:55</a> before I begin David would said that the  
<a onclick="modifyYTiframeseektime('10198')">2:49:58</a> Companions of the Prophet deified the

<a onclick="modifyYTiframeseektime('10215')">2:50:15</a> just a clarification my question is in  
<a onclick="modifyYTiframeseektime('10217')">2:50:17</a> the Old Testament God says he is not a  
<a onclick="modifyYTiframeseektime('10219')">2:50:19</a> man Hosea 11 9 and he is not the son of  
<a onclick="modifyYTiframeseektime('10222')">2:50:22</a> a man numbers 23:19 and he has full  
<a onclick="modifyYTiframeseektime('10225')">2:50:25</a> knowledge psalms 147 Jesus is a man he  
<a onclick="modifyYTiframeseektime('10229')">2:50:29</a> calls himself the son of man and he  
<a onclick="modifyYTiframeseektime('10231')">2:50:31</a> doesn't know everything Christians will  
<a onclick="modifyYTiframeseektime('10232')">2:50:32</a> say that was before he took on the body  
<a onclick="modifyYTiframeseektime('10234')">2:50:34</a> and he took on the attributes of man but  
<a onclick="modifyYTiframeseektime('10236')">2:50:36</a> doesn't this contradict Malachi 3:6  
<a onclick="modifyYTiframeseektime('10238')">2:50:38</a> where the Lord says he does not change  
<a onclick="modifyYTiframeseektime('10243')">2:50:43</a> [Applause]  
<a onclick="modifyYTiframeseektime('10249')">2:50:49</a> I was like 12 things yeah it was one  
<a onclick="modifyYTiframeseektime('10254')">2:50:54</a> thing try to answer whatever you can all  
<a onclick="modifyYTiframeseektime('10256')">2:50:56</a> right as far as yeah we understand that  
<a onclick="modifyYTiframeseektime('10258')">2:50:58</a> Muhammad has died that the problem is  
<a onclick="modifyYTiframeseektime('10260')">2:51:00</a> that Islam keeps taking these things  
<a onclick="modifyYTiframeseektime('10262')">2:51:02</a> like the black stone and the Kaaba and  
<a onclick="modifyYTiframeseektime('10265')">2:51:05</a> Muhammad and treating them in a way that  
<a onclick="modifyYTiframeseektime('10267')">2:51:07</a> is far beyond what you would expect for  
<a onclick="modifyYTiframeseektime('10269')">2:51:09</a> a mere creation so yes I understand  
<a onclick="modifyYTiframeseektime('10271')">2:51:11</a> you know Muhammad died and is not a god  
<a onclick="modifyYTiframeseektime('10273')">2:51:13</a> in that sense I'm saying they're showing  
<a onclick="modifyYTiframeseektime('10275')">2:51:15</a> reverence that should never be shown to  
<a onclick="modifyYTiframeseektime('10277')">2:51:17</a> a mere human being as far as God not  
<a onclick="modifyYTiframeseektime('10280')">2:51:20</a> being a man or the son of man if you  
<a onclick="modifyYTiframeseektime('10283')">2:51:23</a> look what's what's being said there God  
<a onclick="modifyYTiframeseektime('10285')">2:51:25</a> is asked to change his mind he said God  
<a onclick="modifyYTiframeseektime('10287')">2:51:27</a> is not a man that he should then he  
<a onclick="modifyYTiframeseektime('10289')">2:51:29</a> should change his mind so it's saying  
<a onclick="modifyYTiframeseektime('10291')">2:51:31</a> his character is not going to change  
<a onclick="modifyYTiframeseektime('10292')">2:51:32</a> which is the same thing you find in  
<a onclick="modifyYTiframeseektime('10293')">2:51:33</a> Malachi God is not going to change his  
<a onclick="modifyYTiframeseektime('10296')">2:51:36</a> character or in that way it doesn't mean  
<a onclick="modifyYTiframeseektime('10297')">2:51:37</a> God can never do something different in  
<a onclick="modifyYTiframeseektime('10299')">2:51:39</a> some way or that God can't can't enter  
<a onclick="modifyYTiframeseektime('10303')">2:51:43</a> creation he starts enters creation  
<a onclick="modifyYTiframeseektime('10305')">2:51:45</a> repeatedly in Genesis right he walks in  
<a onclick="modifyYTiframeseektime('10307')">2:51:47</a> the garden with Adam so he appears to  
<a onclick="modifyYTiframeseektime('10309')">2:51:49</a> Abraham so God does that's not what  
<a onclick="modifyYTiframeseektime('10312')">2:51:52</a> they're talking about as far as as far  
<a onclick="modifyYTiframeseektime('10314')">2:51:54</a> as God changing house the best I could  
<a onclick="modifyYTiframeseektime('10317')">2:51:57</a> do in one man one question for mister  
<a onclick="modifyYTiframeseektime('10322')">2:52:02</a> good job yes yes the prophet muhammad's

<a onclick="modifyYTiframeseektime('10342')">2:52:22</a> when Jesus Christ said I'm going to the

<a onclick="modifyYTiframeseektime('10359')">2:52:39</a> prophethood now what do we make of what  
<a onclick="modifyYTiframeseektime('10363')">2:52:43</a> Jesus Christ said emphatically to his  
<a onclick="modifyYTiframeseektime('10366')">2:52:46</a> disciples that they should go and wait  
<a onclick="modifyYTiframeseektime('10368')">2:52:48</a> upon him in Jerusalem and then the  
<a onclick="modifyYTiframeseektime('10372')">2:52:52</a> Spirit will come on them and in the  
<a onclick="modifyYTiframeseektime('10373')">2:52:53</a> prophets we witness a spectacle where  
<a onclick="modifyYTiframeseektime('10377')">2:52:57</a> the Holy Spirit comes to the disciple as  
<a onclick="modifyYTiframeseektime('10379')">2:52:59</a> cloven tongues on fire and we see a

<a onclick="modifyYTiframeseektime('10385')">2:53:05</a> lives of the disciples and from there  
<a onclick="modifyYTiframeseektime('10388')">2:53:08</a> even the Roman government could not  
<a onclick="modifyYTiframeseektime('10391')">2:53:11</a> resist the power and the demonstration  
<a onclick="modifyYTiframeseektime('10394')">2:53:14</a> of the Holy Spirit at work in the

<a onclick="modifyYTiframeseektime('10399')">2:53:19</a> Christianity has spread not by sword by  
<a onclick="modifyYTiframeseektime('10402')">2:53:22</a> by the demonstration of the love power  
<a onclick="modifyYTiframeseektime('10404')">2:53:24</a> of the Holy Spirit how do we reconcile  
<a onclick="modifyYTiframeseektime('10407')">2:53:27</a> these demonstrations of the Holy Spirit  
<a onclick="modifyYTiframeseektime('10415')">2:53:35</a> just one request we're gonna after this  
<a onclick="modifyYTiframeseektime('10418')">2:53:38</a> we're gonna have to sing just two more  
<a onclick="modifyYTiframeseektime('10419')">2:53:39</a> questions and try to keep you questions  
<a onclick="modifyYTiframeseektime('10421')">2:53:41</a> like like you know as simple as possible  
<a onclick="modifyYTiframeseektime('10425')">2:53:45</a> because you know we're trying to take as  
<a onclick="modifyYTiframeseektime('10426')">2:53:46</a> much place as I can but you know it's  
<a onclick="modifyYTiframeseektime('10428')">2:53:48</a> impossible with you stretching the  
<a onclick="modifyYTiframeseektime('10430')">2:53:50</a> questions like that because we have  
<a onclick="modifyYTiframeseektime('10430')">2:53:50</a> limited time so okay so there are a few  
<a onclick="modifyYTiframeseektime('10433')">2:53:53</a> points the first thing you said it's  
<a onclick="modifyYTiframeseektime('10435')">2:53:55</a> about taking the Bible as an authority  
<a onclick="modifyYTiframeseektime('10436')">2:53:56</a> yes the Quran says the in GD that told  
<a onclick="modifyYTiframeseektime('10439')">2:53:59</a> up but the original one center of Moses  
<a onclick="modifyYTiframeseektime('10441')">2:54:01</a> and Jesus and the evidence of that is  
<a onclick="modifyYTiframeseektime('10442')">2:54:02</a> chapter 5 verse 46 where it talks about  
<a onclick="modifyYTiframeseektime('10445')">2:54:05</a> a failure and by the in the item in the  
<a onclick="modifyYTiframeseektime('10446')">2:54:06</a> Maryam and then it goes well yeah metal  
<a onclick="modifyYTiframeseektime('10448')">2:54:08</a> indeed women under the Lavi the land  
<a onclick="modifyYTiframeseektime('10451')">2:54:11</a> is Alam Talia al Ghul to me says this  
<a onclick="modifyYTiframeseektime('10453')">2:54:13</a> meaning it goes back to the previous  
<a onclick="modifyYTiframeseektime('10454')">2:54:14</a> passage and the next verse chapter 5  
<a onclick="modifyYTiframeseektime('10456')">2:54:16</a> verse 48 says what more Haman and Ali  
<a onclick="modifyYTiframeseektime('10458')">2:54:18</a> that the Quran is a guardian over the  
<a onclick="modifyYTiframeseektime('10460')">2:54:20</a> Bible yes this book is a guardian over  
<a onclick="modifyYTiframeseektime('10461')">2:54:21</a> this  
<a onclick="modifyYTiframeseektime('10462')">2:54:22</a> so it's an authority in as much as it  
<a onclick="modifyYTiframeseektime('10464')">2:54:24</a> does not contradict the Quran according  
<a onclick="modifyYTiframeseektime('10465')">2:54:25</a> to the Quran  
<a onclick="modifyYTiframeseektime('10466')">2:54:26</a> now that's point 1 point 2 about

<a onclick="modifyYTiframeseektime('10580')">2:56:20</a> mean if this doesn't work out maybe you  
<a onclick="modifyYTiframeseektime('10582')">2:56:22</a> can do some stand-up comedy but you  
<a onclick="modifyYTiframeseektime('10584')">2:56:24</a> asked me you asked somebody asked about  
<a onclick="modifyYTiframeseektime('10586')">2:56:26</a> knock is attack so could you please  
<a onclick="modifyYTiframeseektime('10587')">2:56:27</a> explain who Melchizedek was in the Old  
<a onclick="modifyYTiframeseektime('10589')">2:56:29</a> Testament thank you Oh with Melchizedek  
<a onclick="modifyYTiframeseektime('10593')">2:56:33</a> well we're down to one minute now but if  
<a onclick="modifyYTiframeseektime('10595')">2:56:35</a> you look at what the author of Hebrews  
<a onclick="modifyYTiframeseektime('10597')">2:56:37</a> is doing he's saying that the Jews  
<a onclick="modifyYTiframeseektime('10601')">2:56:41</a> already had their own priesthood the the  
<a onclick="modifyYTiframeseektime('10606')">2:56:46</a> Levitical priesthood but the Messiah is  
<a onclick="modifyYTiframeseektime('10608')">2:56:48</a> going to be from the order of  
<a onclick="modifyYTiframeseektime('10609')">2:56:49</a> Melchizedek so he basically says what  
<a onclick="modifyYTiframeseektime('10612')">2:56:52</a> are the differences in the descriptions  
<a onclick="modifyYTiframeseektime('10614')">2:56:54</a> in scripture he this is a guy who reads  
<a onclick="modifyYTiframeseektime('10616')">2:56:56</a> some kind of codes into the Bible right  
<a onclick="modifyYTiframeseektime('10618')">2:56:58</a> he's looking for codes in description  
<a onclick="modifyYTiframeseektime('10620')">2:57:00</a> they took this very seriously so he says  
<a onclick="modifyYTiframeseektime('10622')">2:57:02</a> what's the difference in the description  
<a onclick="modifyYTiframeseektime('10624')">2:57:04</a> textually between Melchizedek and Levi  
<a onclick="modifyYTiframeseektime('10629')">2:57:09</a> and that's going to tell us something  
<a onclick="modifyYTiframeseektime('10631')">2:57:11</a> about the Messiah so he starts doing  
<a onclick="modifyYTiframeseektime('10633')">2:57:13</a> this haha well we have a genealogy for  
<a onclick="modifyYTiframeseektime('10635')">2:57:15</a> Levi we have none from kissa death right  
<a onclick="modifyYTiframeseektime('10638')">2:57:18</a> and so he starts going down the list and  
<a onclick="modifyYTiframeseektime('10639')">2:57:19</a> then he draws a meaning out of it he's  
<a onclick="modifyYTiframeseektime('10641')">2:57:21</a> not actually saying that he's eternal or  
<a onclick="modifyYTiframeseektime('10643')">2:57:23</a> something like that he's saying  
<a onclick="modifyYTiframeseektime('10644')">2:57:24</a> according these passages we can learn  
<a onclick="modifyYTiframeseektime('10645')">2:57:25</a> something and his conclusion is that the  
<a onclick="modifyYTiframeseektime('10647')">2:57:27</a> Messiah is eternal not that not that not  
<a onclick="modifyYTiframeseektime('10650')">2:57:30</a> that

<a onclick="modifyYTiframeseektime('11019')">3:03:39</a> can you please settle down sir question  
<a onclick="modifyYTiframeseektime('11023')">3:03:43</a> what I know is that most of the Muslims  
<a onclick="modifyYTiframeseektime('11026')">3:03:46</a> memorize the Quran quickly and do you  
<a onclick="modifyYTiframeseektime('11029')">3:03:49</a> know any Muslims any Christians that  
<a onclick="modifyYTiframeseektime('11031')">3:03:51</a> memorize the Bible quickly or are any  
<a onclick="modifyYTiframeseektime('11034')">3:03:54</a> any percent of them well the the Quran  
<a onclick="modifyYTiframeseektime('11039')">3:03:59</a> is designed for an oral culture to be  
<a onclick="modifyYTiframeseektime('11041')">3:04:01</a> memorized easily right there are  
<a onclick="modifyYTiframeseektime('11052')">3:04:12</a> hundreds of thousands of people who have  
<a onclick="modifyYTiframeseektime('11054')">3:04:14</a> memorized dr. Seuss's green eggs and ham  
<a onclick="modifyYTiframeseektime('11056')">3:04:16</a> does that make it the Word of God ladies  
<a onclick="modifyYTiframeseektime('11059')">3:04:19</a> and gentlemen I'm trying to be  
<a onclick="modifyYTiframeseektime('11060')">3:04:20</a> respectful here so that's because these  
<a onclick="modifyYTiframeseektime('11062')">3:04:22</a> are young guys here Christian  
<a onclick="modifyYTiframeseektime('11064')">3:04:24</a> Christianity the Bible is meant to be a  
<a onclick="modifyYTiframeseektime('11067')">3:04:27</a> book that's read right that's the idea  
<a onclick="modifyYTiframeseektime('11070')">3:04:30</a> they they they wrote Creed's and you  
<a onclick="modifyYTiframeseektime('11072')">3:04:32</a> would memorize Creed's we have some of  
<a onclick="modifyYTiframeseektime('11074')">3:04:34</a> them they wrote songs they memorize  
<a onclick="modifyYTiframeseektime('11075')">3:04:35</a> songs but the the books of the Bible are  
<a onclick="modifyYTiframeseektime('11079')">3:04:39</a> written down to the books and to be read  
<a onclick="modifyYTiframeseektime('11082')">3:04:42</a> in public the Quran the Quran is meant  
<a onclick="modifyYTiframeseektime('11085')">3:04:45</a> to be is meant to be is meant to be  
<a onclick="modifyYTiframeseektime('11087')">3:04:47</a> memorized so there are different kinds  
<a onclick="modifyYTiframeseektime('11089')">3:04:49</a> of Scripture why you would say Oh a book  
<a onclick="modifyYTiframeseektime('11093')">3:04:53</a> that's more memorize ofwell or something  
<a onclick="modifyYTiframeseektime('11095')">3:04:55</a> like that is must be more the Word of  
<a onclick="modifyYTiframeseektime('11097')">3:04:57</a> God or something again that would make  
<a onclick="modifyYTiframeseektime('11099')">3:04:59</a> green eggs and ham much much more the  
<a onclick="modifyYTiframeseektime('11101')">3:05:01</a> Word of God than the Quran because it's  
<a onclick="modifyYTiframeseektime('11102')">3:05:02</a> much much easier to understand a little  
<a onclick="modifyYTiframeseektime('11107')">3:05:07</a> side note as far as mocking Muslims  
<a onclick="modifyYTiframeseektime('11109')">3:05:09</a> because it's been brought up like a
