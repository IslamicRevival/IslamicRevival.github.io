### [00:00:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3k6MBedWTww&t=0) - [01:00:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3k6MBedWTww&t=3600)

 is a debate between Mohammed Hijab and David Wood on the topic of the Trinity. Hijab argues that the Trinity is not found in the Bible, while Wood points to passages like John 17:3 which mention the Father, Son, and Holy Spirit as co-equal, co-eternal beings.

**[00:00:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3k6MBedWTww&t=0)**  a debate between Mohammed Hijab and David Wood is held. Kharitonov recites the Quran while they debate. Hijab argues that tawheed (the oneness of God) is more important than trinity (the unity of God). Wood argues that trinity is the only way to believe in God.
* **[00:05:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3k6MBedWTww&t=300)**  introduces the participants in a debate on whether Muslims should follow the rulings of Tawheed (monotheism) or the rulings of Trinity (God being three in One). The main speaker is Mohammed Hijab, a Muslim who supports Tawheed, and David Wood, a Christian who supports Trinity.
* **[00:10:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3k6MBedWTww&t=600)** The two debaters are discussing the Trinity, or the concept of three persons in one body in Christianity and Islam. Mohammed Hajj, an academic researcher and media host, is opposing David Wood, a Christian evangelist and preacher. The debate will focus on the essence of God from both Christian and Muslim perspectives and will be an educational discussion platform expanding on core theological concepts. There will be significant references exchanged from the Quran and the Bible. If you feel easily offended, please do not react.
* **[00:15:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3k6MBedWTww&t=900)** Mohammed argues that the Trinity is found in the Old Testament. He points out that the Nicean Trinity is very specific, and that the Father, Son, and Holy Spirit are three co-equal, independent beings. He also mentions that whenever you find a pronoun referring to God in the Old Testament, you always find it in third person male form.
* **[00:20:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3k6MBedWTww&t=1200)* Discusses the debate between Mohammed Hijab and David Wood over the Trinity. Mohammed Hijab argues that the Trinity is not found in the Bible, while David Wood points to passages like John 17:3 which mention the Father, Son, and Holy Spirit as co-equal Co eternal beings.
* **[00:25:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3k6MBedWTww&t=1500)* Discusses the early Christian understanding of the Trinity, and how this understanding developed over time. It points to examples of prominent Christian figures who advocated the Trinitarian position, and argues that it was not simply a matter of authority being given to certain individuals. Finally, the video discusses the rationality of the Trinity, and how it is a contradiction.
* **[00:30:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3k6MBedWTww&t=1800)** , Ross discusses the contradiction between the Trinity and Mohammed Hijab's assertion that Christianity is talking about the hypostatic Union because "none of Jesus" who is 100% man and 100% God tell him what is a contradiction. Ross dismisses this as impossible and points out that David Wood is part of the evangelical Christian philosophical society. Paul Koplin wrote a whole thing about how talking about social determinism and the idea that Jesus is a being who is differentiated from humans violates the Bible's teaching on the Trinity. James White, a respected scholar of Christianity, refuted Wood on the basis of Peter's verse from Chapter 3.
* **[00:35:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3k6MBedWTww&t=2100)** Mohammed Hijab challenges David Wood to a debate, and Wood responds by discussing the Trinity and how it is found in the Bible. Wood argues that Christians believe in the Trinity because it is forced into view by the triune God, and that the doctrine of tawheed is more confusing than we hear about today.
* **[00:40:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3k6MBedWTww&t=2400)** , a Christian debater debates Mohammed Hijab, a Muslim, on the existence of God. The Christian argues that, based on the Bible, there is only one God, who is the father, son, and spirit. However, the Muslim argues that there is a trinity of gods, Allah, the son, and the spirit, and that Allah is greater than the father and son. The Christian concludes that, as a result of this debate, he has been forced to accept the concept of the Trinity.
* **[00:45:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3k6MBedWTww&t=2700)* Discusses how Muslims interpret Qur'an passages referring to God's face, hands, and feet. Some scholars argue that these passages must be interpreted literally, while others argue that they are figurative. Muhammad also says that certain surahs in the Quran have the ability to intercede on behalf of Muslims. Additionally, Muhammad explains that the Quran is also multi-personal, having a mother and a father.
* **[00:50:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3k6MBedWTww&t=3000)**  Colonel Allah discusses the various ways in which he is deified in Islam. One example is through the use ofAllah's eternal speech, the spirit he breathes out, and Muhammad's companions worshipping him. Additionally, there are references to Allah being uncreated and eternal, and Jesus being a laws word and spirit from Allah. Muslims still address Muhammad directly in their prayers, and although Jesus is not physically present, Muslims believe that he hears and responds to their prayers.
* **[00:55:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3k6MBedWTww&t=3300)** In this debate, Mohammed Hijab argues that the Quran explicitly teaches that all of Allah's physical parts will be destroyed at the end of time. David Wood responds that there are multiple translations of the Quran which say different things about Allah's physical parts, and that there is no evidence that any Muslim scholar has ever said that this is a lie.
### [01:00:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3k6MBedWTww&t=3600) - [02:00:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3k6MBedWTww&t=7200)

The two Muslims debate the validity of Christianity and the Trinity. The first Muslim argues that the Quran accidentally deifies Jesus because he is mentioned in the Kalima (a Muslim formula of faith). The second Muslim points out that the Trinity is not mentioned in the Quran and that Christianity was put under the bus by the first Muslim.

**[01:00:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3k6MBedWTww&t=3600)* Discusses a hadith that states that when a person recites the Quran, the angel carries it to the Prophet Muhammad. argues that this means Muhammad is divine, and that trinitarianism is invalid because the Quran explicitly states that Jesus is not divine.
* **[01:05:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3k6MBedWTww&t=3900)** argues that the Islamic concept of God is more confusing than what we're typically told, and that Allah prays.
* **[01:10:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3k6MBedWTww&t=4200)* Discusses hadith that state Allahprays for self-control in order to punish the Israelites. It also discusses the Quran, which is seen as an eternal person and takes the form of a pale man. Mohammed critiques the Trinity doctrine by saying that if individual chapters of the Quran are seen as persons, then the entire Quran should be seen as a person.
* **[01:15:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3k6MBedWTww&t=4500)** of the video argues that if Islam is not literally based on biology, then it must be based on metaphorical concepts, which Christianity and Judaism also use. also argues that the Islamic belief in the Sonship of Jesus is wrong, and that the Islamic practice of spitting on Muhammad and collecting his blood and urine is an example of idolatry and paganism.
* **[01:20:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3k6MBedWTww&t=4800)** , two Muslims debate the validity of Christianity and the Trinity. The first Muslim argues that the Quran accidentally deifies Jesus because he is mentioned in the Kalima (a Muslim formula of faith). The second Muslim points out that the Trinity is not mentioned in the Quran and that Christianity was put under the bus by the first Muslim.
* **[01:25:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3k6MBedWTww&t=5100)** In a debate against David Wood, Muslim convert Mohammed Hijab points to passages in the Old Testament which suggest that God is plural. Dr. David Wood responds by saying that these passages must be interpreted away because they do not actually call for the doctrine of the Trinity.
* **[01:30:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3k6MBedWTww&t=5400)** Mohammed Hijab argues that the three names of God, "Israel Yahweh Elohim Yahweh," are one term and not three separate entities. He argues that this doctrine of unity is revealed progressively throughout the Old Testament, and that it is not mentioned explicitly in the New Testament. Unitarian Christians, he claims, are describing Trinitarian doctrine in Trinitarian terms, which refutes the Christian doctrine of the Trinity.
* **[01:35:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3k6MBedWTww&t=5700)** Dr. David Wood responds to Mohammed Hijab's argument that all Christian fathers were wrong in their understanding of the Trinity because of the various distinctions they made over time. Wood argues that these distinctions derive from going back to Scripture and understanding what lines up with it. He concludes that, even if every Christian father were wrong, the doctrine of the Trinity would still be true.
* **[01:40:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3k6MBedWTww&t=6000)* Discusses the difference between the meanings of the words "Allah" and "Holy Spirit" in the Quran and hadith, and points out that Muslims translators are now translating the word "praise" in the hadith as "Allah" to avoid confusion. argues that this demonstrates the creator's hierarchy, and that only the Father knows when the hour is.
* **[01:45:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3k6MBedWTww&t=6300)** Justin Martyr argues that just as pagans believe that Jupiter is a god, Christians believe in a God who has an earthly body and a Holy Spirit.
* **[01:50:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3k6MBedWTww&t=6600)* Discusses the beliefs of early Christians, specifically regarding the Trinity. points to various passages from the Quran which support the idea of Tawheed - the oneness of God. Dr. Woodley asks a third question, which Touhey answers affirmatively.
* **[01:55:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3k6MBedWTww&t=6900)* Discusses how Christianity and Islam approach the Old Testament, with Christianity viewing it as containing moral teachings, while Islam considers some of the passages to be immoral. He also points out that Muhammad taught that swearing by anything other than Allah is committing shirk, which is associating oneself with Allah.
### [02:00:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3k6MBedWTww&t=7200) - [03:00:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3k6MBedWTww&t=10800)

 Dr. David Wood debates Mohammed Hajab on the issue of apostolic succession in Islam. Wood points out that, historically, there was no apostolic succession between Jesus's crucifixion and the Council of Nicaea, which was the first official recognition of Christianity by the Roman Empire. This leaves Islam without a clear theological lineage between Jesus and Muhammad.

**[02:00:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3k6MBedWTww&t=7200)* Discusses how he believes that morality can be achieved from other than an objective law, and how this applies to the Old Testament. He then goes on to say that while some bad things happen in the Old Testament, it can be reconciled with the New Testament teachings of God being love.
* **[02:05:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3k6MBedWTww&t=7500)* Discusses the differences between early Christianity and Islam, specifically mentioning that while early Christians believed that Jesus was both God and human, some Muslims believe that Jesus was only human and not God.  argues that this is a false belief, as evidenced by the fact that the early church fathers used language to designate Jesus as both God and human's equal.
* **[02:10:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3k6MBedWTww&t=7800)* Discusses the beliefs of early Christians, including the Ebionites, in relation to the Holy Spirit. He states that the Ebionites did not have the Bible, and that only parts of the Gospel of Matthew were available to them. points out that when Hippolytus discusses the beliefs of the Ebionites, it is a primary source material. He then uses a minute to discuss the implications of this belief on Islam.
* **[02:15:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3k6MBedWTww&t=8100)* Discusses how various terms used in the Bible, such as "God," "Ebionites," and "Holy Spirit," can be used to describe Jesus, the Father, and the Holy Spirit. It argues that, because these terms were used seriously of Jesus, the Father, and the Holy Spirit, Christians should accept him as the Messiah and believe in his claims.
* **[02:20:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3k6MBedWTww&t=8400)**  Dr. David Wood discusses the differences between Christianity and Islam and how they view prophets. He states that while Christianity believes in progressive revelation, Islam does not end with Jesus. At the end of the video, he offers a piece of advice for those who want to repent and be forgiven by Muslims.
* **[02:25:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3k6MBedWTww&t=8700)* Discusses the claim that Muslim scholars make that the Prophet's companions drank his blood. He then provides a list of scholars who made this claim.
* **[02:30:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3k6MBedWTww&t=9000)**  Dr. David Wood debates Mohammed Hajab, a Muslim cleric, on the issue of apostolic succession in Islam. Wood points out that, historically, there was no apostolic succession between Jesus's crucifixion and the Council of Nicaea, which was the first official recognition of Christianity by the Roman Empire. This leaves Islam without a clear theological lineage between Jesus and Muhammad.
* **[02:35:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3k6MBedWTww&t=9300)** of the video argues that because of David's lack of Arabic knowledge, it is impossible for him to discern the will of God. They go on to say that there are many people who are very learned in Arabic who have the same epistemological and scientific critiques of the Quran as those who are self-professed Muslims.
* **[02:40:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3k6MBedWTww&t=9600)** In this YouTube debate, Mohammed Hijab and David Wood discuss the Arabic language of the Quran. Wood argues that it is only Arabs who can access the Quran in its pure form, and that this is why only 5% of the population can understand it. Hijab argues that the language of the Quran is a means of communication for the people, and that it has evolved over time.
* **[02:45:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3k6MBedWTww&t=9900)** Mohammed Hijab and David Wood debate the idea that certain beliefs in Christianity and Hinduism overlap, with Wood arguing that Christianity is not a subset of Hinduism. The discussion turns to whether or not Jesus' disciples became "higher" than those who disbelieved after his death, with Hijab arguing that this is clearly stated in the Quran.
* **[02:50:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3k6MBedWTww&t=10200)* Discusses how Prophet Mohammed was not a god, and Christianity did not spread by the sword. It also mentions how the Quran is an authority in as much as it does not contradict the Bible.
* **[02:55:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3k6MBedWTww&t=10500)** Mohammed Hijab and David Wood debate the difference between Islam and Christianity, with Wood concluding that Christianity is based more in scripture than in tradition. Hijab claims that Christianity is based in tradition more than scripture, and that Christians worship more Augustine than God.
### [03:00:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3k6MBedWTww&t=10800) - [03:05:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3k6MBedWTww&t=11100)

, two different viewpoints on Islam are presented: that of Mohammed Hijab, a Muslim woman who argues that the Quran is better than the Bible because it is easier to understand, and that of David Wood, a Christian who argues that the Bible is better than the Quran because it is the word of God. The debate is respectful, with both sides making valid points. In the end, it is up to the individual to decide which religion is better for them.

**[03:00:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3k6MBedWTww&t=10800)** Mohammed Hijab argues that the Bible is not the word of God because it is not easily memorized. He also points out that Abraham and Solomon had many wives, which goes against Christian teachings. Finally, he asks David Wood why he was not upset with David when he was mocking Muslims for ten years.
* **[03:05:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3k6MBedWTww&t=11100)** , two different viewpoints on Islam are presented: that of Mohammed Hijab, a Muslim woman who argues that the Quran is better than the Bible because it is easier to understand, and that of David Wood, a Christian who argues that the Bible is better than the Quran because it is the word of God. Both speakers are courteous and end their discussion with a reminder to be respectful of each other's beliefs.

[0:08:22](https://youtu.be/3k6MBedWTww?t=502) highly relevant to today's debate this  
[0:08:25](https://youtu.be/3k6MBedWTww?t=505) is essentially a doubt initiative and

[0:15:46](https://youtu.be/3k6MBedWTww?t=946) there's lots in common we believe in  
[0:15:49](https://youtu.be/3k6MBedWTww?t=949) jesus christ who believe in the Messiah  
[0:15:51](https://youtu.be/3k6MBedWTww?t=951) we believe in him we love the Messiah  
[0:15:54](https://youtu.be/3k6MBedWTww?t=954) who believe Jesus I believe that he was  
[0:15:56](https://youtu.be/3k6MBedWTww?t=956) born from the Virgin Mary there's a  
[0:15:59](https://youtu.be/3k6MBedWTww?t=959) whole chapter in the Quran dedicated to  
[0:16:00](https://youtu.be/3k6MBedWTww?t=960) that well of course the elephant in the  
[0:16:03](https://youtu.be/3k6MBedWTww?t=963) room or the difference of opinion is in  
[0:16:06](https://youtu.be/3k6MBedWTww?t=966) the fact that we as Muslims do not  
[0:16:09](https://youtu.be/3k6MBedWTww?t=969) believe that Jesus was divine or that  
[0:16:13](https://youtu.be/3k6MBedWTww?t=973) the Holy Spirit is divine today's  
[0:16:15](https://youtu.be/3k6MBedWTww?t=975) discussion ladies and gentlemen is about  
[0:16:17](https://youtu.be/3k6MBedWTww?t=977) our head and Trinity so hate is  
[0:16:22](https://youtu.be/3k6MBedWTww?t=982) monotheism  
[0:16:24](https://youtu.be/3k6MBedWTww?t=984) to believe and worship in one God the  
[0:16:27](https://youtu.be/3k6MBedWTww?t=987) Quran says put below I had the love  
[0:16:28](https://youtu.be/3k6MBedWTww?t=988) summit that say he is unlock one and  
[0:16:31](https://youtu.be/3k6MBedWTww?t=991) only the eternally besought of all the  
[0:16:33](https://youtu.be/3k6MBedWTww?t=993) sovereign the Trinity is defined by the  
[0:16:38](https://youtu.be/3k6MBedWTww?t=998) after nation Street in 500 AD after  
[0:16:40](https://youtu.be/3k6MBedWTww?t=1000) nation Creed as one divine person that  
[0:16:44](https://youtu.be/3k6MBedWTww?t=1004) one Divine Being divided into three  
[0:16:46](https://youtu.be/3k6MBedWTww?t=1006) divine persons the Father the Son and  
[0:16:48](https://youtu.be/3k6MBedWTww?t=1008) the Holy Spirit the father is God the  
[0:16:51](https://youtu.be/3k6MBedWTww?t=1011) Son is God the Holy Spirit is God but  
[0:16:54](https://youtu.be/3k6MBedWTww?t=1014) there are not three gods but one God it  
[0:16:57](https://youtu.be/3k6MBedWTww?t=1017) goes the father is Almighty  
[0:16:59](https://youtu.be/3k6MBedWTww?t=1019) the son is almighty and the Holy Spirit  
[0:17:02](https://youtu.be/3k6MBedWTww?t=1022) is Almighty but there are not three or  
[0:17:03](https://youtu.be/3k6MBedWTww?t=1023) Mighty's there's one Almighty this is  
[0:17:06](https://youtu.be/3k6MBedWTww?t=1026) what the Athanasian Creed says now to be  
[0:17:09](https://youtu.be/3k6MBedWTww?t=1029) honest with you I've heard David would  
[0:17:11](https://youtu.be/3k6MBedWTww?t=1031) speak before and I've noticed that there  
[0:17:13](https://youtu.be/3k6MBedWTww?t=1033) are three common fallacies that he falls  
[0:17:15](https://youtu.be/3k6MBedWTww?t=1035) into quite often one of them is a  
[0:17:18](https://youtu.be/3k6MBedWTww?t=1038) fallacy called the to call qui fallacy  
[0:17:20](https://youtu.be/3k6MBedWTww?t=1040) which is an appeal to hypocracy another  
[0:17:23](https://youtu.be/3k6MBedWTww?t=1043) one is a straw man and a third one is  
[0:17:25](https://youtu.be/3k6MBedWTww?t=1045) the red herring these three fallacies  
[0:17:28](https://youtu.be/3k6MBedWTww?t=1048) are employed by him quite often and he  
[0:17:33](https://youtu.be/3k6MBedWTww?t=1053) talks about Islam extensively as you  
[0:17:34](https://youtu.be/3k6MBedWTww?t=1054) guys may know in a negative way  
[0:17:37](https://youtu.be/3k6MBedWTww?t=1057) Salaam Initiative has put up a database  
[0:17:40](https://youtu.be/3k6MBedWTww?t=1060) of all of the major misconceptions  
[0:17:43](https://youtu.be/3k6MBedWTww?t=1063) against Islam being answered and this  
[0:17:45](https://youtu.be/3k6MBedWTww?t=1065) can be seen in the link below I also  
[0:17:48](https://youtu.be/3k6MBedWTww?t=1068) want to give credit to one team member  
[0:17:53](https://youtu.be/3k6MBedWTww?t=1073) who has made a website called many  
[0:17:55](https://youtu.be/3k6MBedWTww?t=1075) prophets one message which can also be  
[0:17:58](https://youtu.be/3k6MBedWTww?t=1078) seen in the link below you can see more  
[0:18:00](https://youtu.be/3k6MBedWTww?t=1080) information about that now to come  
[0:18:02](https://youtu.be/3k6MBedWTww?t=1082) straight into it the question now is  
[0:18:05](https://youtu.be/3k6MBedWTww?t=1085) this the question is when we look at the  
[0:18:10](https://youtu.be/3k6MBedWTww?t=1090) Old Testament do we find this idea of  
[0:18:15](https://youtu.be/3k6MBedWTww?t=1095) the Nicean Trinity because the Nicean  
[0:18:17](https://youtu.be/3k6MBedWTww?t=1097) Trinity is very specific  
[0:18:20](https://youtu.be/3k6MBedWTww?t=1100) after the Constantinople Creed in 381  
[0:18:23](https://youtu.be/3k6MBedWTww?t=1103) the idea that the Father the Son and the  
[0:18:26](https://youtu.be/3k6MBedWTww?t=1106) Holy Spirit are three co-equal Co  
[0:18:29](https://youtu.be/3k6MBedWTww?t=1109) eternal independent beings remember  
[0:18:32](https://youtu.be/3k6MBedWTww?t=1112) those words Co  
[0:18:33](https://youtu.be/3k6MBedWTww?t=1113) Coweta no independent persons of the one  
[0:18:38](https://youtu.be/3k6MBedWTww?t=1118) being of God  
[0:18:39](https://youtu.be/3k6MBedWTww?t=1119) this is the Nicene understanding of the  
[0:18:41](https://youtu.be/3k6MBedWTww?t=1121) Trinity now having said that guys when  
[0:18:44](https://youtu.be/3k6MBedWTww?t=1124) you look at the Old Testament do we see  
[0:18:47](https://youtu.be/3k6MBedWTww?t=1127) this because when we look at the Old  
[0:18:49](https://youtu.be/3k6MBedWTww?t=1129) Testament we find the Shama chapter 6  
[0:18:51](https://youtu.be/3k6MBedWTww?t=1131) verse 4 Shama Israel at the right along  
[0:18:53](https://youtu.be/3k6MBedWTww?t=1133) you know I've had here o Israel My Lord  
[0:18:57](https://youtu.be/3k6MBedWTww?t=1137) our Lord is one load here when you look  
[0:19:01](https://youtu.be/3k6MBedWTww?t=1141) at the first commandment chapter 20  
[0:19:03](https://youtu.be/3k6MBedWTww?t=1143) verse 3 of Exodus you find there's no  
[0:19:05](https://youtu.be/3k6MBedWTww?t=1145) God beside me I'm your Lord and is not  
[0:19:07](https://youtu.be/3k6MBedWTww?t=1147) God beside me you find in Isaiah chapter  
[0:19:10](https://youtu.be/3k6MBedWTww?t=1150) 43 verse 11  
[0:19:11](https://youtu.be/3k6MBedWTww?t=1151) once again the discussion of I'm you God  
[0:19:14](https://youtu.be/3k6MBedWTww?t=1154) and besides me there is no Savior now  
[0:19:18](https://youtu.be/3k6MBedWTww?t=1158) someone might argue about the word  
[0:19:20](https://youtu.be/3k6MBedWTww?t=1160) eloheem and this is the weakness of the  
[0:19:22](https://youtu.be/3k6MBedWTww?t=1162) argument it's a weak linguistic Cartman  
[0:19:25](https://youtu.be/3k6MBedWTww?t=1165) who at him is a majestic plural they  
[0:19:27](https://youtu.be/3k6MBedWTww?t=1167) would argue look there are nine thousand  
[0:19:33](https://youtu.be/3k6MBedWTww?t=1173) pronouns in the Bible which relates to  
[0:19:35](https://youtu.be/3k6MBedWTww?t=1175) God's name let's take for example  
[0:19:38](https://youtu.be/3k6MBedWTww?t=1178) Genesis chapter 1 verse 1  
[0:19:41](https://youtu.be/3k6MBedWTww?t=1181) Bereshit Maha siddhis Baha Elohim the  
[0:19:48](https://youtu.be/3k6MBedWTww?t=1188) word Baja means he created whenever you  
[0:19:52](https://youtu.be/3k6MBedWTww?t=1192) find a pronoun in the Old Testament  
[0:19:56](https://youtu.be/3k6MBedWTww?t=1196) referring to you know him  
[0:19:58](https://youtu.be/3k6MBedWTww?t=1198) you always find it in third person male  
[0:20:04](https://youtu.be/3k6MBedWTww?t=1204) singular one more time  
[0:20:07](https://youtu.be/3k6MBedWTww?t=1207) third-person male singular you don't  
[0:20:10](https://youtu.be/3k6MBedWTww?t=1210) find a plural version of that you don't  
[0:20:13](https://youtu.be/3k6MBedWTww?t=1213) find the a pronoun which is pluralized  
[0:20:15](https://youtu.be/3k6MBedWTww?t=1215) so now the question would be is this a  
[0:20:18](https://youtu.be/3k6MBedWTww?t=1218) Jew who is acquainted with the Torah  
[0:20:20](https://youtu.be/3k6MBedWTww?t=1220) with the Old Testament why would one ask  
[0:20:23](https://youtu.be/3k6MBedWTww?t=1223) him to realign his belief his  
[0:20:25](https://youtu.be/3k6MBedWTww?t=1225) theological doctrines into believing in  
[0:20:27](https://youtu.be/3k6MBedWTww?t=1227) a triune God  
[0:20:29](https://youtu.be/3k6MBedWTww?t=1229) when in fact he's been instructed quite  
[0:20:33](https://youtu.be/3k6MBedWTww?t=1233) explicitly in fact in the Old Testament  
[0:20:34](https://youtu.be/3k6MBedWTww?t=1234) not to break the commandments you see it  
[0:20:41](https://youtu.be/3k6MBedWTww?t=1241) gets a little bit more interesting even  
[0:20:42](https://youtu.be/3k6MBedWTww?t=1242) when you look at the New Testament now  
[0:20:43](https://youtu.be/3k6MBedWTww?t=1243) we're not the New Testament has  
[0:20:46](https://youtu.be/3k6MBedWTww?t=1246) different Austen authors there's 27  
[0:20:47](https://youtu.be/3k6MBedWTww?t=1247) books of the New Testament  
[0:20:48](https://youtu.be/3k6MBedWTww?t=1248) you've got Paul who's written up from 7  
[0:20:51](https://youtu.be/3k6MBedWTww?t=1251) to 13 books and there's dispute as to  
[0:20:53](https://youtu.be/3k6MBedWTww?t=1253) exactly how much is written John written  
[0:20:56](https://youtu.be/3k6MBedWTww?t=1256) many books who is John we don't know who  
[0:20:57](https://youtu.be/3k6MBedWTww?t=1257) John is by the way we don't know who  
[0:20:59](https://youtu.be/3k6MBedWTww?t=1259) John is but yes  
[0:21:01](https://youtu.be/3k6MBedWTww?t=1261) Paul had a kind of exaltation  
[0:21:03](https://youtu.be/3k6MBedWTww?t=1263) Christology there's no doubt he did  
[0:21:05](https://youtu.be/3k6MBedWTww?t=1265) believe that Jesus was divine and a good  
[0:21:08](https://youtu.be/3k6MBedWTww?t=1268) example of that is the second  
[0:21:10](https://youtu.be/3k6MBedWTww?t=1270) Philippians for him but he believed in a  
[0:21:15](https://youtu.be/3k6MBedWTww?t=1275) kind of supposed racialism how do we  
[0:21:16](https://youtu.be/3k6MBedWTww?t=1276) know that because if you look at in line  
[0:21:18](https://youtu.be/3k6MBedWTww?t=1278) 9 to 11 it's quite explicit that God  
[0:21:22](https://youtu.be/3k6MBedWTww?t=1282) gives him the name so he didn't have it  
[0:21:25](https://youtu.be/3k6MBedWTww?t=1285) before Jesus did not have the name  
[0:21:27](https://youtu.be/3k6MBedWTww?t=1287) before and he makes above all names so  
[0:21:30](https://youtu.be/3k6MBedWTww?t=1290) that he believes in a kind of  
[0:21:31](https://youtu.be/3k6MBedWTww?t=1291) subordination is now a subordination ISM  
[0:21:32](https://youtu.be/3k6MBedWTww?t=1292) it's a hierarchy within the Trinity  
[0:21:34](https://youtu.be/3k6MBedWTww?t=1294) remember we said and I see and Trinity  
[0:21:36](https://youtu.be/3k6MBedWTww?t=1296) is three co-equal Co eternal persons of  
[0:21:40](https://youtu.be/3k6MBedWTww?t=1300) the Godhead Paul didn't believe this he  
[0:21:43](https://youtu.be/3k6MBedWTww?t=1303) believes in a hierarchy John believed in  
[0:21:46](https://youtu.be/3k6MBedWTww?t=1306) an incarnation Christology in the  
[0:21:48](https://youtu.be/3k6MBedWTww?t=1308) beginning was the word and the Word was  
[0:21:49](https://youtu.be/3k6MBedWTww?t=1309) with God  
[0:21:50](https://youtu.be/3k6MBedWTww?t=1310) everyone knows the prologue John chapter  
[0:21:52](https://youtu.be/3k6MBedWTww?t=1312) 1 yeah but the question is this who is  
[0:21:56](https://youtu.be/3k6MBedWTww?t=1316) John his gospel was found some 95 ad  
[0:21:59](https://youtu.be/3k6MBedWTww?t=1319) this is the time it was found in 95 AD  
[0:22:01](https://youtu.be/3k6MBedWTww?t=1321) that's some 65 years after Jesus's  
[0:22:04](https://youtu.be/3k6MBedWTww?t=1324) disappearance  
[0:22:05](https://youtu.be/3k6MBedWTww?t=1325) the irony overall is that you'll find in  
[0:22:10](https://youtu.be/3k6MBedWTww?t=1330) the Gospel of John  
[0:22:12](https://youtu.be/3k6MBedWTww?t=1332) for example passages like John 17:3  
[0:22:18](https://youtu.be/3k6MBedWTww?t=1338) where explicitly mentions that the  
[0:22:20](https://youtu.be/3k6MBedWTww?t=1340) father is the only true God explicitly  
[0:22:23](https://youtu.be/3k6MBedWTww?t=1343) mentions this and this was such a thorn  
[0:22:25](https://youtu.be/3k6MBedWTww?t=1345) in the side of the church fathers that  
[0:22:29](https://youtu.be/3k6MBedWTww?t=1349) Augustine a major church father who died  
[0:22:34](https://youtu.be/3k6MBedWTww?t=1354) 430 ad and who  
[0:22:36](https://youtu.be/3k6MBedWTww?t=1356) who wrote an exegesis on John do you  
[0:22:40](https://youtu.be/3k6MBedWTww?t=1360) know he said he rearranged the words of  
[0:22:43](https://youtu.be/3k6MBedWTww?t=1363) John chapter 17 verse 3 he changed the  
[0:22:47](https://youtu.be/3k6MBedWTww?t=1367) word order so as to make Jesus and the  
[0:22:50](https://youtu.be/3k6MBedWTww?t=1370) father the true gods this is how severe  
[0:22:52](https://youtu.be/3k6MBedWTww?t=1372) it was when you find mark chapter 12  
[0:22:56](https://youtu.be/3k6MBedWTww?t=1376) verse 29 that you came to Jesus asking  
[0:23:03](https://youtu.be/3k6MBedWTww?t=1383) how to be saved and what did Jesus say  
[0:23:05](https://youtu.be/3k6MBedWTww?t=1385) did Jesus say and Mark by the way is the  
[0:23:07](https://youtu.be/3k6MBedWTww?t=1387) most ancient manuscript of all of the  
[0:23:10](https://youtu.be/3k6MBedWTww?t=1390) Gospels most ancient Gospels what did  
[0:23:15](https://youtu.be/3k6MBedWTww?t=1395) Jesus say did he say you have to believe  
[0:23:18](https://youtu.be/3k6MBedWTww?t=1398) in the Father the Son and the Holy  
[0:23:20](https://youtu.be/3k6MBedWTww?t=1400) Spirit as co-equal Co eternal  
[0:23:21](https://youtu.be/3k6MBedWTww?t=1401) independent beings he said no he said he  
[0:23:25](https://youtu.be/3k6MBedWTww?t=1405) referred him to the Shema chapter 6  
[0:23:28](https://youtu.be/3k6MBedWTww?t=1408) verse 4 of Deuteronomy that's what he  
[0:23:31](https://youtu.be/3k6MBedWTww?t=1411) referred him to he didn't tell them  
[0:23:32](https://youtu.be/3k6MBedWTww?t=1412) believe me as God or believe the Holy  
[0:23:34](https://youtu.be/3k6MBedWTww?t=1414) Spirit is God or all these things know  
[0:23:37](https://youtu.be/3k6MBedWTww?t=1417) so you see real entry that the question  
[0:23:40](https://youtu.be/3k6MBedWTww?t=1420) is where do people Christians today  
[0:23:42](https://youtu.be/3k6MBedWTww?t=1422) where do they get their information of  
[0:23:43](https://youtu.be/3k6MBedWTww?t=1423) the Trinity you'll find that in Matthew  
[0:23:47](https://youtu.be/3k6MBedWTww?t=1427) chapter 28 verse 19 it talks about it's  
[0:23:51](https://youtu.be/3k6MBedWTww?t=1431) called the baptismal formula where the  
[0:23:53](https://youtu.be/3k6MBedWTww?t=1433) father a son of the Holy Spirit is  
[0:23:54](https://youtu.be/3k6MBedWTww?t=1434) mentioned going the way a baptizing the  
[0:23:56](https://youtu.be/3k6MBedWTww?t=1436) way the Father the Son and the Holy  
[0:23:57](https://youtu.be/3k6MBedWTww?t=1437) Spirit and so Christians use this as  
[0:24:01](https://youtu.be/3k6MBedWTww?t=1441) just proof okay is in the Bible now the  
[0:24:04](https://youtu.be/3k6MBedWTww?t=1444) users say look the Trinity is in the  
[0:24:07](https://youtu.be/3k6MBedWTww?t=1447) Bible now but why don't they look at  
[0:24:09](https://youtu.be/3k6MBedWTww?t=1449) Luke chapter 9 verse 26 because Luke  
[0:24:11](https://youtu.be/3k6MBedWTww?t=1451) chapter 9 verse 26 has a different  
[0:24:13](https://youtu.be/3k6MBedWTww?t=1453) triadic formula where there's the father  
[0:24:15](https://youtu.be/3k6MBedWTww?t=1455) the son and the holy angels yes the holy  
[0:24:20](https://youtu.be/3k6MBedWTww?t=1460) angels not the Holy Spirit so why don't  
[0:24:23](https://youtu.be/3k6MBedWTww?t=1463) we infer a Trinity from this this is the  
[0:24:26](https://youtu.be/3k6MBedWTww?t=1466) question now we've had these debates  
[0:24:30](https://youtu.be/3k6MBedWTww?t=1470) before and they've been done before and  
[0:24:32](https://youtu.be/3k6MBedWTww?t=1472) it's usually okay we'll get a vague  
[0:24:34](https://youtu.be/3k6MBedWTww?t=1474) verse here and I'm vigorous verse here  
[0:24:35](https://youtu.be/3k6MBedWTww?t=1475) and we'll start talking about these  
[0:24:36](https://youtu.be/3k6MBedWTww?t=1476) things but here's an interesting  
[0:24:38](https://youtu.be/3k6MBedWTww?t=1478) question now how did the earliest  
[0:24:43](https://youtu.be/3k6MBedWTww?t=1483) generations of Christians interpret the  
[0:24:46](https://youtu.be/3k6MBedWTww?t=1486) New Testament corpus you have church  
[0:24:50](https://youtu.be/3k6MBedWTww?t=1490) fathers who are the most learned men of  
[0:24:53](https://youtu.be/3k6MBedWTww?t=1493) Christendom people at Clement of Rome  
[0:24:58](https://youtu.be/3k6MBedWTww?t=1498) Polycom origin people like those  
[0:25:03](https://youtu.be/3k6MBedWTww?t=1503) individuals  
[0:25:04](https://youtu.be/3k6MBedWTww?t=1504) none of those church fathers for the  
[0:25:07](https://youtu.be/3k6MBedWTww?t=1507) first 300 years listen to what I'm  
[0:25:11](https://youtu.be/3k6MBedWTww?t=1511) saying  
[0:25:11](https://youtu.be/3k6MBedWTww?t=1511) none of those church fathers for the  
[0:25:15](https://youtu.be/3k6MBedWTww?t=1515) first 300 years of churches dream in  
[0:25:19](https://youtu.be/3k6MBedWTww?t=1519) third a nice C and Trinity from this can  
[0:25:24](https://youtu.be/3k6MBedWTww?t=1524) you imagine  
[0:25:25](https://youtu.be/3k6MBedWTww?t=1525) 300 years 10 minutes Eve even Julian who  
[0:25:32](https://youtu.be/3k6MBedWTww?t=1532) died 240 ad to Julian who dubbed or  
[0:25:35](https://youtu.be/3k6MBedWTww?t=1535) coined the term Trinity us which was  
[0:25:38](https://youtu.be/3k6MBedWTww?t=1538) later translated into Trinity he was a  
[0:25:41](https://youtu.be/3k6MBedWTww?t=1541) subordination is he believed the  
[0:25:44](https://youtu.be/3k6MBedWTww?t=1544) hierarchy within the different persons  
[0:25:48](https://youtu.be/3k6MBedWTww?t=1548) of the Godhead the interesting point  
[0:25:52](https://youtu.be/3k6MBedWTww?t=1552) here is you have someone like you have  
[0:25:56](https://youtu.be/3k6MBedWTww?t=1556) someone like Hill operas he was taught  
[0:26:02](https://youtu.be/3k6MBedWTww?t=1562) by Iranian massive church father Justin  
[0:26:06](https://youtu.be/3k6MBedWTww?t=1566) Matta massive church father he taught  
[0:26:08](https://youtu.be/3k6MBedWTww?t=1568) origin of Alexandria massive church  
[0:26:10](https://youtu.be/3k6MBedWTww?t=1570) father and he writes in his book against  
[0:26:13](https://youtu.be/3k6MBedWTww?t=1573) the heresies in chapter 22 what does he  
[0:26:15](https://youtu.be/3k6MBedWTww?t=1575) write he talks about this group called  
[0:26:17](https://youtu.be/3k6MBedWTww?t=1577) the Ebionites who were around around 70  
[0:26:21](https://youtu.be/3k6MBedWTww?t=1581) AD forty years after the disappearance  
[0:26:25](https://youtu.be/3k6MBedWTww?t=1585) of Jesus and they believed that Jesus  
[0:26:28](https://youtu.be/3k6MBedWTww?t=1588) was not God that he was a prophet and  
[0:26:33](https://youtu.be/3k6MBedWTww?t=1593) that he was the Messiah there were other  
[0:26:38](https://youtu.be/3k6MBedWTww?t=1598) groups like the monarchy lists who  
[0:26:40](https://youtu.be/3k6MBedWTww?t=1600) believed the non divinity of Jesus it  
[0:26:42](https://youtu.be/3k6MBedWTww?t=1602) wasn't just the Ebionites someone our  
[0:26:44](https://youtu.be/3k6MBedWTww?t=1604) kin is also believed that Jesus was not  
[0:26:46](https://youtu.be/3k6MBedWTww?t=1606) divine in the way that Trinitarians make  
[0:26:48](https://youtu.be/3k6MBedWTww?t=1608) out to be no one spoke about the Holy  
[0:26:52](https://youtu.be/3k6MBedWTww?t=1612) Spirit  
[0:26:52](https://youtu.be/3k6MBedWTww?t=1612) being God co-equal and coeternal and  
[0:26:55](https://youtu.be/3k6MBedWTww?t=1615) independent with the father and the son  
[0:26:57](https://youtu.be/3k6MBedWTww?t=1617) in the first 300 years that discussion  
[0:27:00](https://youtu.be/3k6MBedWTww?t=1620) is completely gone so this is quite  
[0:27:06](https://youtu.be/3k6MBedWTww?t=1626) interesting ladies and gentlemen you  
[0:27:07](https://youtu.be/3k6MBedWTww?t=1627) know why because you could say from this  
[0:27:11](https://youtu.be/3k6MBedWTww?t=1631) that we're the Islamic position of the  
[0:27:15](https://youtu.be/3k6MBedWTww?t=1635) non divinity of Jesus and the non  
[0:27:17](https://youtu.be/3k6MBedWTww?t=1637) divinity of the Holy Spirit was  
[0:27:21](https://youtu.be/3k6MBedWTww?t=1641) represented in the early church then I  
[0:27:24](https://youtu.be/3k6MBedWTww?t=1644) see in Trinitarian position was not who  
[0:27:27](https://youtu.be/3k6MBedWTww?t=1647) I say that one more time he wants to  
[0:27:29](https://youtu.be/3k6MBedWTww?t=1649) hear it okay where the Islamic position  
[0:27:35](https://youtu.be/3k6MBedWTww?t=1655) of the non divinity of Jesus Christ was  
[0:27:41](https://youtu.be/3k6MBedWTww?t=1661) present and the non divinity of the Holy  
[0:27:44](https://youtu.be/3k6MBedWTww?t=1664) Spirit was present in early Christian  
[0:27:46](https://youtu.be/3k6MBedWTww?t=1666) church history the Nicean Trinitarian  
[0:27:50](https://youtu.be/3k6MBedWTww?t=1670) understanding of the post Constantinople  
[0:27:52](https://youtu.be/3k6MBedWTww?t=1672) Creed was not proved me wrong David  
[0:27:56](https://youtu.be/3k6MBedWTww?t=1676) prove me wrong give me one person for  
[0:28:00](https://youtu.be/3k6MBedWTww?t=1680) the first 300 years of church history  
[0:28:02](https://youtu.be/3k6MBedWTww?t=1682) that detail co-equal Co eternal  
[0:28:05](https://youtu.be/3k6MBedWTww?t=1685) independent father son Holy Spirit gave  
[0:28:08](https://youtu.be/3k6MBedWTww?t=1688) me silence me prove me wrong I want to  
[0:28:12](https://youtu.be/3k6MBedWTww?t=1692) be proven wrong today I want to be  
[0:28:15](https://youtu.be/3k6MBedWTww?t=1695) proven wrong to be silence me tell me  
[0:28:19](https://youtu.be/3k6MBedWTww?t=1699) one church father for the first 300  
[0:28:20](https://youtu.be/3k6MBedWTww?t=1700) years of church history that said the  
[0:28:22](https://youtu.be/3k6MBedWTww?t=1702) Holy Spirit was co-equal Co eternal  
[0:28:24](https://youtu.be/3k6MBedWTww?t=1704) independent with the father a son please  
[0:28:27](https://youtu.be/3k6MBedWTww?t=1707) please give me the give me the records  
[0:28:29](https://youtu.be/3k6MBedWTww?t=1709) is a historical investigation you just  
[0:28:31](https://youtu.be/3k6MBedWTww?t=1711) give me one I will be quiet I will  
[0:28:32](https://youtu.be/3k6MBedWTww?t=1712) apologize I will apologize in front of  
[0:28:35](https://youtu.be/3k6MBedWTww?t=1715) everyone I will apologize in front of  
[0:28:38](https://youtu.be/3k6MBedWTww?t=1718) everyone yes  
[0:28:40](https://youtu.be/3k6MBedWTww?t=1720) now it gets a little bit more sticky  
[0:28:44](https://youtu.be/3k6MBedWTww?t=1724) than that because if you look at a book  
[0:28:45](https://youtu.be/3k6MBedWTww?t=1725) called the Christian doctrines early  
[0:28:48](https://youtu.be/3k6MBedWTww?t=1728) Christian doctrines by J&D Kelly  
[0:28:49](https://youtu.be/3k6MBedWTww?t=1729) conservative Christian scholar he  
[0:28:51](https://youtu.be/3k6MBedWTww?t=1731) details exactly how this Trinitarian  
[0:28:53](https://youtu.be/3k6MBedWTww?t=1733) nice internet Aryan thing came about if  
[0:28:56](https://youtu.be/3k6MBedWTww?t=1736) you look at chapter 5 is a very  
[0:28:57](https://youtu.be/3k6MBedWTww?t=1737) interesting read go and read it  
[0:28:58](https://youtu.be/3k6MBedWTww?t=1738) it's  
[0:28:59](https://youtu.be/3k6MBedWTww?t=1739) that you had for example Athanasius who  
[0:29:01](https://youtu.be/3k6MBedWTww?t=1741) was a very ardent trinitarian around  
[0:29:03](https://youtu.be/3k6MBedWTww?t=1743) Nicean times and then you have Hillary  
[0:29:06](https://youtu.be/3k6MBedWTww?t=1746) up on tears they were advocating the  
[0:29:08](https://youtu.be/3k6MBedWTww?t=1748) trinitarian position then you had the  
[0:29:09](https://youtu.be/3k6MBedWTww?t=1749) capital she and fathers who are Greg  
[0:29:11](https://youtu.be/3k6MBedWTww?t=1751) Greg revenues and Xia's gregory of nyssa  
[0:29:13](https://youtu.be/3k6MBedWTww?t=1753) and mass of the grape and they battle  
[0:29:15](https://youtu.be/3k6MBedWTww?t=1755) the so-called great they are the ones  
[0:29:17](https://youtu.be/3k6MBedWTww?t=1757) who advanced the Trinitarian position  
[0:29:19](https://youtu.be/3k6MBedWTww?t=1759) the question is who gave those guys the  
[0:29:21](https://youtu.be/3k6MBedWTww?t=1761) authority to interpret texts like this  
[0:29:23](https://youtu.be/3k6MBedWTww?t=1763) and to overrule all the things that came  
[0:29:26](https://youtu.be/3k6MBedWTww?t=1766) before why  
[0:29:27](https://youtu.be/3k6MBedWTww?t=1767) now the last thing I want to talk about  
[0:29:30](https://youtu.be/3k6MBedWTww?t=1770) is the rationality of the Trinity  
[0:29:33](https://youtu.be/3k6MBedWTww?t=1773) because this has to be mentioned now the  
[0:29:34](https://youtu.be/3k6MBedWTww?t=1774) Trinity asked Thomas Jefferson mentioned  
[0:29:37](https://youtu.be/3k6MBedWTww?t=1777) is an unintelligible is what he says an  
[0:29:41](https://youtu.be/3k6MBedWTww?t=1781) unintelligible idea of platonic  
[0:29:43](https://youtu.be/3k6MBedWTww?t=1783) mysticisms that three are one it's a  
[0:29:47](https://youtu.be/3k6MBedWTww?t=1787) contradiction ladies and gentlemen that  
[0:29:49](https://youtu.be/3k6MBedWTww?t=1789) you have fathers almighty son Almighty  
[0:29:52](https://youtu.be/3k6MBedWTww?t=1792) Holy Spirit is Almighty  
[0:29:54](https://youtu.be/3k6MBedWTww?t=1794) but they're not through all that is  
[0:29:55](https://youtu.be/3k6MBedWTww?t=1795) about one Almighty that's a  
[0:29:58](https://youtu.be/3k6MBedWTww?t=1798) contradiction that's why Randolph Road  
[0:30:00](https://youtu.be/3k6MBedWTww?t=1800) Ross wrote in his book common sense  
[0:30:01](https://youtu.be/3k6MBedWTww?t=1801) Christianity talking about the  
[0:30:03](https://youtu.be/3k6MBedWTww?t=1803) hypostatic Union because none of Jesus  
[0:30:05](https://youtu.be/3k6MBedWTww?t=1805) who's 100% man and 100% God tell me what  
[0:30:10](https://youtu.be/3k6MBedWTww?t=1810) is a contradiction of that isn't it's  
[0:30:12](https://youtu.be/3k6MBedWTww?t=1812) like saying X is a hundred percent a  
[0:30:14](https://youtu.be/3k6MBedWTww?t=1814) square and 100 percent a circle Randolph  
[0:30:19](https://youtu.be/3k6MBedWTww?t=1819) Ross II dismissed this is impossible I  
[0:30:21](https://youtu.be/3k6MBedWTww?t=1821) can't believe this  
[0:30:22](https://youtu.be/3k6MBedWTww?t=1822) he's a Christian now as is mentioned in  
[0:30:25](https://youtu.be/3k6MBedWTww?t=1825) nine minutes left in the introduction in  
[0:30:27](https://youtu.be/3k6MBedWTww?t=1827) the introduction he mentioned that David  
[0:30:30](https://youtu.be/3k6MBedWTww?t=1830) Wood is part of the evangelical  
[0:30:31](https://youtu.be/3k6MBedWTww?t=1831) Christian philosophical society his  
[0:30:33](https://youtu.be/3k6MBedWTww?t=1833) Boston superior someone called Paul  
[0:30:34](https://youtu.be/3k6MBedWTww?t=1834) Koplin  
[0:30:35](https://youtu.be/3k6MBedWTww?t=1835) Paul Koplin wrote a whole thing talking  
[0:30:37](https://youtu.be/3k6MBedWTww?t=1837) about because talking about social  
[0:30:39](https://youtu.be/3k6MBedWTww?t=1839) determinism and basically he tries to  
[0:30:41](https://youtu.be/3k6MBedWTww?t=1841) reason in the same way as Nabeel Qureshi  
[0:30:43](https://youtu.be/3k6MBedWTww?t=1843) did in his previous debate by the way  
[0:30:44](https://youtu.be/3k6MBedWTww?t=1844) with Shiva rally he says a look the way  
[0:30:46](https://youtu.be/3k6MBedWTww?t=1846) it works is he said look I'm a being and  
[0:30:49](https://youtu.be/3k6MBedWTww?t=1849) European yes I am Muhammad her job I'm a  
[0:30:53](https://youtu.be/3k6MBedWTww?t=1853) being I'm a human being  
[0:30:54](https://youtu.be/3k6MBedWTww?t=1854) David was a human being  
[0:30:56](https://youtu.be/3k6MBedWTww?t=1856) but how is differentiated from you  
[0:30:59](https://youtu.be/3k6MBedWTww?t=1859) that's what he said  
[0:31:01](https://youtu.be/3k6MBedWTww?t=1861) how is differentiated from you this is  
[0:31:02](https://youtu.be/3k6MBedWTww?t=1862) the idea that Paul Koplin  
[0:31:04](https://youtu.be/3k6MBedWTww?t=1864) and William Lane Craig and these social  
[0:31:06](https://youtu.be/3k6MBedWTww?t=1866) Trinitarians believe in that how it  
[0:31:08](https://youtu.be/3k6MBedWTww?t=1868) differentiated from who that's not  
[0:31:11](https://youtu.be/3k6MBedWTww?t=1871) correct that's false you know why  
[0:31:13](https://youtu.be/3k6MBedWTww?t=1873) because you can only differentiate from  
[0:31:15](https://youtu.be/3k6MBedWTww?t=1875) how from who when you have a  
[0:31:17](https://youtu.be/3k6MBedWTww?t=1877) multiplicity of instantiations in any  
[0:31:19](https://youtu.be/3k6MBedWTww?t=1879) given genus say that one more time when  
[0:31:21](https://youtu.be/3k6MBedWTww?t=1881) you have a multiplicity of instantiation  
[0:31:23](https://youtu.be/3k6MBedWTww?t=1883) in any given genus e in any given class  
[0:31:25](https://youtu.be/3k6MBedWTww?t=1885) let me tell you I mean I can't  
[0:31:27](https://youtu.be/3k6MBedWTww?t=1887) differentiate between me Muhammad you  
[0:31:29](https://youtu.be/3k6MBedWTww?t=1889) God and David whoops unless the two of  
[0:31:33](https://youtu.be/3k6MBedWTww?t=1893) us because if there was one human being  
[0:31:36](https://youtu.be/3k6MBedWTww?t=1896) the how the rule would be that the what  
[0:31:39](https://youtu.be/3k6MBedWTww?t=1899) said that all more time if there was one  
[0:31:41](https://youtu.be/3k6MBedWTww?t=1901) human being the who would be the what  
[0:31:44](https://youtu.be/3k6MBedWTww?t=1904) and the what would be the who there  
[0:31:45](https://youtu.be/3k6MBedWTww?t=1905) would be no differentiation you have to  
[0:31:47](https://youtu.be/3k6MBedWTww?t=1907) establish now and this is the third  
[0:31:48](https://youtu.be/3k6MBedWTww?t=1908) thing I want to say how you can have a  
[0:31:51](https://youtu.be/3k6MBedWTww?t=1911) differentiation from who and how without  
[0:31:54](https://youtu.be/3k6MBedWTww?t=1914) having a multiplicity of instantiation  
[0:31:57](https://youtu.be/3k6MBedWTww?t=1917) in any given genus which means you have  
[0:32:01](https://youtu.be/3k6MBedWTww?t=1921) to admit first that there was more than  
[0:32:02](https://youtu.be/3k6MBedWTww?t=1922) one God for you to differentiate between  
[0:32:04](https://youtu.be/3k6MBedWTww?t=1924) them as persons and by the way this is  
[0:32:08](https://youtu.be/3k6MBedWTww?t=1928) an unbiblical unscriptural thing the  
[0:32:10](https://youtu.be/3k6MBedWTww?t=1930) differentiation between person and being  
[0:32:13](https://youtu.be/3k6MBedWTww?t=1933) it's an unbiblical thing I would like to  
[0:32:16](https://youtu.be/3k6MBedWTww?t=1936) see if it is in the Bible where it is in  
[0:32:18](https://youtu.be/3k6MBedWTww?t=1938) the Bible so just to summarize what I've  
[0:32:21](https://youtu.be/3k6MBedWTww?t=1941) said because I've only got three minutes  
[0:32:22](https://youtu.be/3k6MBedWTww?t=1942) left these are the questions I want the  
[0:32:25](https://youtu.be/3k6MBedWTww?t=1945) answers to today question one why is it  
[0:32:31](https://youtu.be/3k6MBedWTww?t=1951) that in the Old Testament you do not  
[0:32:33](https://youtu.be/3k6MBedWTww?t=1953) find the Trinity mentioned or inferred  
[0:32:36](https://youtu.be/3k6MBedWTww?t=1956) and if it wasn't for why haven't the  
[0:32:40](https://youtu.be/3k6MBedWTww?t=1960) rabbi's the Jewish scholars for 4,000  
[0:32:44](https://youtu.be/3k6MBedWTww?t=1964) years of Hebrew history inferred it  
[0:32:46](https://youtu.be/3k6MBedWTww?t=1966) that's question one question 2  
[0:32:49](https://youtu.be/3k6MBedWTww?t=1969) how is it the case that if the Trinity  
[0:32:54](https://youtu.be/3k6MBedWTww?t=1974) is explicit in the New Testament that  
[0:32:56](https://youtu.be/3k6MBedWTww?t=1976) for 300 years of church history nice  
[0:33:00](https://youtu.be/3k6MBedWTww?t=1980) unitarianism was not inferred by the  
[0:33:03](https://youtu.be/3k6MBedWTww?t=1983) church fathers question three  
[0:33:07](https://youtu.be/3k6MBedWTww?t=1987) well give me one person of the first 300  
[0:33:12](https://youtu.be/3k6MBedWTww?t=1992) years that says that the Holy Spirit was  
[0:33:15](https://youtu.be/3k6MBedWTww?t=1995) Co eternal co-equal independent with God  
[0:33:19](https://youtu.be/3k6MBedWTww?t=1999) one name I will apologize in front of  
[0:33:22](https://youtu.be/3k6MBedWTww?t=2002) everyone today yes I will apologize  
[0:33:26](https://youtu.be/3k6MBedWTww?t=2006) question for how is it the case that  
[0:33:32](https://youtu.be/3k6MBedWTww?t=2012) how can you rationalize this  
[0:33:35](https://youtu.be/3k6MBedWTww?t=2015) contradiction of the Trinity when you  
[0:33:38](https://youtu.be/3k6MBedWTww?t=2018) have a hypostatic Union someone who is  
[0:33:41](https://youtu.be/3k6MBedWTww?t=2021) 100% man and 100% God are you telling me  
[0:33:44](https://youtu.be/3k6MBedWTww?t=2024) to believe in the squared circle today  
[0:33:46](https://youtu.be/3k6MBedWTww?t=2026) sir is that the is that what you have  
[0:33:50](https://youtu.be/3k6MBedWTww?t=2030) for me you want me to become a  
[0:33:53](https://youtu.be/3k6MBedWTww?t=2033) Trinitarian square circle and then you  
[0:33:54](https://youtu.be/3k6MBedWTww?t=2034) have another thing the Father is  
[0:33:57](https://youtu.be/3k6MBedWTww?t=2037) Almighty  
[0:33:57](https://youtu.be/3k6MBedWTww?t=2037) the son is Almighty in the Holy Spirit  
[0:33:58](https://youtu.be/3k6MBedWTww?t=2038) Almighty the Quran refuses chapter 23  
[0:34:00](https://youtu.be/3k6MBedWTww?t=2040) verse 91 now Alibaba whom Allah but if  
[0:34:04](https://youtu.be/3k6MBedWTww?t=2044) this was the case they would have tried  
[0:34:05](https://youtu.be/3k6MBedWTww?t=2045) to outstrip each other deal with the  
[0:34:07](https://youtu.be/3k6MBedWTww?t=2047) Quranic argument you'd like to attack  
[0:34:09](https://youtu.be/3k6MBedWTww?t=2049) the Quran you will see today that the  
[0:34:11](https://youtu.be/3k6MBedWTww?t=2051) planet argument will suffocate you it  
[0:34:13](https://youtu.be/3k6MBedWTww?t=2053) will suffocate you  
[0:34:15](https://youtu.be/3k6MBedWTww?t=2055) [Applause]  
[0:34:23](https://youtu.be/3k6MBedWTww?t=2063) number five one minute left  
[0:34:26](https://youtu.be/3k6MBedWTww?t=2066) in fact I think four questions is a lot  
[0:34:31](https://youtu.be/3k6MBedWTww?t=2071) for this man if you could do with four  
[0:34:33](https://youtu.be/3k6MBedWTww?t=2073) I'll be grateful to him I want to say  
[0:34:36](https://youtu.be/3k6MBedWTww?t=2076) one thing before I can't fight you might  
[0:34:39](https://youtu.be/3k6MBedWTww?t=2079) be thinking why are you being quite firm  
[0:34:41](https://youtu.be/3k6MBedWTww?t=2081) with this man today you know James white  
[0:34:44](https://youtu.be/3k6MBedWTww?t=2084) he's a very respectable scholar of  
[0:34:45](https://youtu.be/3k6MBedWTww?t=2085) Christianity and he's a good man yes he  
[0:34:49](https://youtu.be/3k6MBedWTww?t=2089) is and he refuted this man because of  
[0:34:51](https://youtu.be/3k6MBedWTww?t=2091) his mockery this man makes  
[0:34:53](https://youtu.be/3k6MBedWTww?t=2093) mockumentaries against Muslims and he  
[0:34:56](https://youtu.be/3k6MBedWTww?t=2096) refuted him on the basis of a verse in  
[0:34:57](https://youtu.be/3k6MBedWTww?t=2097) the Bible first Peter chapter 3 verse 15  
[0:35:00](https://youtu.be/3k6MBedWTww?t=2100) where it says be respectful and  
[0:35:02](https://youtu.be/3k6MBedWTww?t=2102) honorable what is the point of causing  
[0:35:04](https://youtu.be/3k6MBedWTww?t=2104) social Disko Asian what is the point of  
[0:35:07](https://youtu.be/3k6MBedWTww?t=2107) attacking a people making a mockumentary  
[0:35:10](https://youtu.be/3k6MBedWTww?t=2110) of Muslims drawing the Prophet playing  
[0:35:13](https://youtu.be/3k6MBedWTww?t=2113) them in the thumbnail all those things  
[0:35:14](https://youtu.be/3k6MBedWTww?t=2114) and you know it's going to offend the  
[0:35:16](https://youtu.be/3k6MBedWTww?t=2116) Muslim community isn't that high time at  
[0:35:18](https://youtu.be/3k6MBedWTww?t=2118) the age of isn't high time at the edge  
[0:35:21](https://youtu.be/3k6MBedWTww?t=2121) of Islam of five seconds and racism that  
[0:35:23](https://youtu.be/3k6MBedWTww?t=2123) we stopped this was salam aliekum wa  
[0:35:25](https://youtu.be/3k6MBedWTww?t=2125) rahamtullah again

[0:35:33](https://youtu.be/3k6MBedWTww?t=2133) [Applause]  
[0:35:35](https://youtu.be/3k6MBedWTww?t=2135) thank you very much Mahadev for that  
[0:35:39](https://youtu.be/3k6MBedWTww?t=2139) wonderful opening statement and not  
[0:35:41](https://youtu.be/3k6MBedWTww?t=2141) without further ado we have dr. David  
[0:35:42](https://youtu.be/3k6MBedWTww?t=2142) Wood with his first 20 minutes of  
[0:35:44](https://youtu.be/3k6MBedWTww?t=2144) opening statement he'd jam this thing in  
[0:35:56](https://youtu.be/3k6MBedWTww?t=2156) there alright I'll just leave it like  
[0:35:59](https://youtu.be/3k6MBedWTww?t=2159) that can't overcome that strength all  
[0:36:03](https://youtu.be/3k6MBedWTww?t=2163) right well good evening I'd like to  
[0:36:05](https://youtu.be/3k6MBedWTww?t=2165) thank Mohammed had job for challenging  
[0:36:09](https://youtu.be/3k6MBedWTww?t=2169) me to this debate and for crossing the  
[0:36:12](https://youtu.be/3k6MBedWTww?t=2172) Atlantic Ocean so that we can share our  
[0:36:14](https://youtu.be/3k6MBedWTww?t=2174) thoughts with you I'd also like to thank  
[0:36:16](https://youtu.be/3k6MBedWTww?t=2176) grassroots Dawa and the Muslim Students  
[0:36:19](https://youtu.be/3k6MBedWTww?t=2179) Association and all the other groups  
[0:36:21](https://youtu.be/3k6MBedWTww?t=2181) that were involved in organizing and  
[0:36:25](https://youtu.be/3k6MBedWTww?t=2185) planning and hosting my prediction is  
[0:36:29](https://youtu.be/3k6MBedWTww?t=2189) that tonight will be what what young  
[0:36:32](https://youtu.be/3k6MBedWTww?t=2192) people call epic see now what's the  
[0:36:37](https://youtu.be/3k6MBedWTww?t=2197) difference between the Trinity and sowhy  
[0:36:42](https://youtu.be/3k6MBedWTww?t=2202) well one is admittedly so utterly  
[0:36:47](https://youtu.be/3k6MBedWTww?t=2207) confusing that people wonder how it can  
[0:36:49](https://youtu.be/3k6MBedWTww?t=2209) possibly be true the other is the  
[0:36:53](https://youtu.be/3k6MBedWTww?t=2213) Trinity yes you're going to find out  
[0:36:56](https://youtu.be/3k6MBedWTww?t=2216) that I think that the doctrine of  
[0:36:59](https://youtu.be/3k6MBedWTww?t=2219) tawheed which oddly enough we didn't  
[0:37:01](https://youtu.be/3k6MBedWTww?t=2221) hear much about in Mohammed had jobs  
[0:37:04](https://youtu.be/3k6MBedWTww?t=2224) opening statement I'm convinced that the  
[0:37:06](https://youtu.be/3k6MBedWTww?t=2226) doctrine of tell he'd at least as it was  
[0:37:07](https://youtu.be/3k6MBedWTww?t=2227) taught by Mohammed is vastly more  
[0:37:10](https://youtu.be/3k6MBedWTww?t=2230) confusing than we hear about today so  
[0:37:14](https://youtu.be/3k6MBedWTww?t=2234) let's compare them and we'll start with  
[0:37:16](https://youtu.be/3k6MBedWTww?t=2236) the Trinity why do Christians believe in  
[0:37:19](https://youtu.be/3k6MBedWTww?t=2239) the doctrine of the Trinity we believe  
[0:37:25](https://youtu.be/3k6MBedWTww?t=2245) it because we are forced into this view  
[0:37:26](https://youtu.be/3k6MBedWTww?t=2246) by the triune God not because of church  
[0:37:30](https://youtu.be/3k6MBedWTww?t=2250) councils the church councils were forced  
[0:37:32](https://youtu.be/3k6MBedWTww?t=2252) into that view by the triune God for  
[0:37:40](https://youtu.be/3k6MBedWTww?t=2260) Christians  
[0:37:41](https://youtu.be/3k6MBedWTww?t=2261) we have certain amount of data that we  
[0:37:44](https://youtu.be/3k6MBedWTww?t=2264) work with everyone has some data right  
[0:37:46](https://youtu.be/3k6MBedWTww?t=2266) we look around we see the world we see  
[0:37:47](https://youtu.be/3k6MBedWTww?t=2267) that it's organized in certain ways we  
[0:37:49](https://youtu.be/3k6MBedWTww?t=2269) know that there's a moral law there are  
[0:37:51](https://youtu.be/3k6MBedWTww?t=2271) hundreds of millions of people in the  
[0:37:52](https://youtu.be/3k6MBedWTww?t=2272) world today who believe that they have  
[0:37:53](https://youtu.be/3k6MBedWTww?t=2273) witnessed miracles all of this helps us  
[0:37:56](https://youtu.be/3k6MBedWTww?t=2276) formulate a concept of God but  
[0:37:59](https://youtu.be/3k6MBedWTww?t=2279) Christians also have the Scriptures the  
[0:38:01](https://youtu.be/3k6MBedWTww?t=2281) Old Testament and the New Testament and  
[0:38:03](https://youtu.be/3k6MBedWTww?t=2283) when we start reading the scriptures  
[0:38:06](https://youtu.be/3k6MBedWTww?t=2286) things get very interesting very quickly  
[0:38:09](https://youtu.be/3k6MBedWTww?t=2289) so these are the first two verses of the  
[0:38:12](https://youtu.be/3k6MBedWTww?t=2292) Bible long before Christians came along  
[0:38:13](https://youtu.be/3k6MBedWTww?t=2293) in the beginning God created the heavens  
[0:38:16](https://youtu.be/3k6MBedWTww?t=2296) and the earth and the earth was without  
[0:38:18](https://youtu.be/3k6MBedWTww?t=2298) form and void and darkness was over the  
[0:38:21](https://youtu.be/3k6MBedWTww?t=2301) face of the deep and the Spirit of God  
[0:38:24](https://youtu.be/3k6MBedWTww?t=2304) was hovering over the face of the waters  
[0:38:28](https://youtu.be/3k6MBedWTww?t=2308) so we've got God but then there's a  
[0:38:31](https://youtu.be/3k6MBedWTww?t=2311) distinction it says and the Spirit of  
[0:38:32](https://youtu.be/3k6MBedWTww?t=2312) God was hovering over the face of the  
[0:38:36](https://youtu.be/3k6MBedWTww?t=2316) waters  
[0:38:37](https://youtu.be/3k6MBedWTww?t=2317) later in the same chapter opening  
[0:38:40](https://youtu.be/3k6MBedWTww?t=2320) chapter the Bible verse 26 we read then  
[0:38:43](https://youtu.be/3k6MBedWTww?t=2323) God said let us make man in our image  
[0:38:48](https://youtu.be/3k6MBedWTww?t=2328) after our likeness now two obvious  
[0:38:52](https://youtu.be/3k6MBedWTww?t=2332) questions one who is he talking to  
[0:38:55](https://youtu.be/3k6MBedWTww?t=2335) and two why does he say let us plural  
[0:38:58](https://youtu.be/3k6MBedWTww?t=2338) make man plural I mean make man in our  
[0:39:01](https://youtu.be/3k6MBedWTww?t=2341) Laurel image the plural of majesty right  
[0:39:06](https://youtu.be/3k6MBedWTww?t=2346) well the Jews didn't use the plural of  
[0:39:08](https://youtu.be/3k6MBedWTww?t=2348) majesty so why is he using this it's  
[0:39:12](https://youtu.be/3k6MBedWTww?t=2352) just a mystery so far we don't know yet  
[0:39:15](https://youtu.be/3k6MBedWTww?t=2355) but as we continue reading the mystery  
[0:39:18](https://youtu.be/3k6MBedWTww?t=2358) gets deeper in Isaiah 9:6 the Prophet  
[0:39:22](https://youtu.be/3k6MBedWTww?t=2362) delivers a prophecy for to us a child is  
[0:39:26](https://youtu.be/3k6MBedWTww?t=2366) born to us a son is given and the  
[0:39:28](https://youtu.be/3k6MBedWTww?t=2368) government shall be upon his shoulder  
[0:39:30](https://youtu.be/3k6MBedWTww?t=2370) and his name shall be called wonderful  
[0:39:33](https://youtu.be/3k6MBedWTww?t=2373) counselor mighty God father of eternity  
[0:39:37](https://youtu.be/3k6MBedWTww?t=2377) Prince of Peace a child is born a son is  
[0:39:40](https://youtu.be/3k6MBedWTww?t=2380) given and this child is said to be the  
[0:39:44](https://youtu.be/3k6MBedWTww?t=2384) mighty God how's a child going to be the  
[0:39:46](https://youtu.be/3k6MBedWTww?t=2386) mighty God in Isaiah chapter 48 verse 16  
[0:39:51](https://youtu.be/3k6MBedWTww?t=2391) yahweh is speaking yahweh is the speaker  
[0:39:54](https://youtu.be/3k6MBedWTww?t=2394) and he says draw near to me here this  
[0:39:57](https://youtu.be/3k6MBedWTww?t=2397) from the beginning I have not spoken in  
[0:40:00](https://youtu.be/3k6MBedWTww?t=2400) secret from the time it came to be I  
[0:40:02](https://youtu.be/3k6MBedWTww?t=2402) have been there and now the Lord God has  
[0:40:06](https://youtu.be/3k6MBedWTww?t=2406) sent me and his spirit yahuwah is  
[0:40:11](https://youtu.be/3k6MBedWTww?t=2411) speaking and yahweh says that he has  
[0:40:13](https://youtu.be/3k6MBedWTww?t=2413) been sent by yahweh along with the  
[0:40:15](https://youtu.be/3k6MBedWTww?t=2415) spirit of yahweh how can god be sent by  
[0:40:19](https://youtu.be/3k6MBedWTww?t=2419) god along with the Spirit of God well we  
[0:40:22](https://youtu.be/3k6MBedWTww?t=2422) just don't know still later in the Old  
[0:40:25](https://youtu.be/3k6MBedWTww?t=2425) Testament zachariah 12:10 Yahweh is  
[0:40:28](https://youtu.be/3k6MBedWTww?t=2428) again speaking and he says I will pour  
[0:40:31](https://youtu.be/3k6MBedWTww?t=2431) out on the house of David and the  
[0:40:33](https://youtu.be/3k6MBedWTww?t=2433) inhabitants of Jerusalem a spirit of  
[0:40:35](https://youtu.be/3k6MBedWTww?t=2435) grace and supplication they will look on  
[0:40:38](https://youtu.be/3k6MBedWTww?t=2438) me the one they have pierced and they  
[0:40:40](https://youtu.be/3k6MBedWTww?t=2440) will mourn for him as one mourns for an  
[0:40:43](https://youtu.be/3k6MBedWTww?t=2443) only child and grieve bitterly for him  
[0:40:45](https://youtu.be/3k6MBedWTww?t=2445) as one grieves for a firstborn son  
[0:40:47](https://youtu.be/3k6MBedWTww?t=2447) Yahweh will pour out a spirit which  
[0:40:49](https://youtu.be/3k6MBedWTww?t=2449) causes people to repent and they will  
[0:40:51](https://youtu.be/3k6MBedWTww?t=2451) look on Yahweh whom they have pierced  
[0:40:53](https://youtu.be/3k6MBedWTww?t=2453) and mourn for him as one grieves for a  
[0:40:56](https://youtu.be/3k6MBedWTww?t=2456) lost son how can an immaterial God be  
[0:41:01](https://youtu.be/3k6MBedWTww?t=2461) pierced unless he takes on the body so  
[0:41:05](https://youtu.be/3k6MBedWTww?t=2465) the Old Testament concludes and leaves  
[0:41:07](https://youtu.be/3k6MBedWTww?t=2467) us with a lot of questions about how to  
[0:41:10](https://youtu.be/3k6MBedWTww?t=2470) reconcile the claim that there is only  
[0:41:11](https://youtu.be/3k6MBedWTww?t=2471) one God with some intriguing hints at  
[0:41:15](https://youtu.be/3k6MBedWTww?t=2475) plurality then Jesus comes along Jesus  
[0:41:21](https://youtu.be/3k6MBedWTww?t=2481) tells his followers that he's the final  
[0:41:23](https://youtu.be/3k6MBedWTww?t=2483) judge of all people even though the Old  
[0:41:25](https://youtu.be/3k6MBedWTww?t=2485) Testament says that Yahweh is the final  
[0:41:28](https://youtu.be/3k6MBedWTww?t=2488) judge of all people Jesus says that he's  
[0:41:33](https://youtu.be/3k6MBedWTww?t=2493) the one who raises the dead at the  
[0:41:35](https://youtu.be/3k6MBedWTww?t=2495) resurrection even though the Old  
[0:41:37](https://youtu.be/3k6MBedWTww?t=2497) Testament says that Yahweh is the one  
[0:41:39](https://youtu.be/3k6MBedWTww?t=2499) who raises the dead at the resurrection  
[0:41:41](https://youtu.be/3k6MBedWTww?t=2501) Jesus calls himself the lord of the  
[0:41:45](https://youtu.be/3k6MBedWTww?t=2505) Sabbath he claims to be the lord of the  
[0:41:47](https://youtu.be/3k6MBedWTww?t=2507) Prophet David he claims to be the IAM of  
[0:41:50](https://youtu.be/3k6MBedWTww?t=2510) the Exodus he claims to be greater than  
[0:41:53](https://youtu.be/3k6MBedWTww?t=2513) God's temple Jesus tells us that he has  
[0:41:56](https://youtu.be/3k6MBedWTww?t=2516) an absolutely unique relationship with  
[0:41:58](https://youtu.be/3k6MBedWTww?t=2518) the Father that he can answer prayers  
[0:41:59](https://youtu.be/3k6MBedWTww?t=2519) that he's present wherever his followers  
[0:42:01](https://youtu.be/3k6MBedWTww?t=2521) are gathered that he is with his  
[0:42:03](https://youtu.be/3k6MBedWTww?t=2523) followers forever and that he has all  
[0:42:06](https://youtu.be/3k6MBedWTww?t=2526) authority  
[0:42:07](https://youtu.be/3k6MBedWTww?t=2527) in heaven and on earth he even makes the  
[0:42:10](https://youtu.be/3k6MBedWTww?t=2530) startling declaration that all things  
[0:42:13](https://youtu.be/3k6MBedWTww?t=2533) that the father has are mine but Jesus  
[0:42:18](https://youtu.be/3k6MBedWTww?t=2538) also prays to the Father and he claims  
[0:42:22](https://youtu.be/3k6MBedWTww?t=2542) to be from the father why would Jesus  
[0:42:25](https://youtu.be/3k6MBedWTww?t=2545) make claims that only God can make yet  
[0:42:28](https://youtu.be/3k6MBedWTww?t=2548) also be drawing attention to God as the  
[0:42:32](https://youtu.be/3k6MBedWTww?t=2552) father in John 14 through 16 Jesus says  
[0:42:36](https://youtu.be/3k6MBedWTww?t=2556) that after he returns to the Father he  
[0:42:38](https://youtu.be/3k6MBedWTww?t=2558) and the father will together send the  
[0:42:41](https://youtu.be/3k6MBedWTww?t=2561) Holy Spirit the Spirit is sent and yet  
[0:42:45](https://youtu.be/3k6MBedWTww?t=2565) as we've seen the Spirit was with the  
[0:42:48](https://youtu.be/3k6MBedWTww?t=2568) father at creation Psalm 104 verse 30  
[0:42:52](https://youtu.be/3k6MBedWTww?t=2572) says that the Spirit creates the  
[0:42:53](https://youtu.be/3k6MBedWTww?t=2573) universe the Spirit is omniscient in  
[0:42:56](https://youtu.be/3k6MBedWTww?t=2576) first Corinthians omnipresent in Psalm  
[0:42:59](https://youtu.be/3k6MBedWTww?t=2579) 139 and eternal in Hebrews 9 these are  
[0:43:04](https://youtu.be/3k6MBedWTww?t=2584) divine attributes and the Spirit is  
[0:43:07](https://youtu.be/3k6MBedWTww?t=2587) distinct from the father and the son  
[0:43:11](https://youtu.be/3k6MBedWTww?t=2591) so what do we do with all of this well  
[0:43:14](https://youtu.be/3k6MBedWTww?t=2594) if the father is God and the son is God  
[0:43:16](https://youtu.be/3k6MBedWTww?t=2596) and the Spirit is God and the father is  
[0:43:19](https://youtu.be/3k6MBedWTww?t=2599) not the son and the son is not the  
[0:43:21](https://youtu.be/3k6MBedWTww?t=2601) spirit and the Spirit is not the father  
[0:43:24](https://youtu.be/3k6MBedWTww?t=2604) and there's only one God the Trinity is  
[0:43:29](https://youtu.be/3k6MBedWTww?t=2609) the only way out and that's why I said  
[0:43:31](https://youtu.be/3k6MBedWTww?t=2611) that we were forced into this view by  
[0:43:33](https://youtu.be/3k6MBedWTww?t=2613) the triune God himself now my Muslim  
[0:43:39](https://youtu.be/3k6MBedWTww?t=2619) friends tell me that this concept of God  
[0:43:41](https://youtu.be/3k6MBedWTww?t=2621) is absurd even though we got it from God  
[0:43:44](https://youtu.be/3k6MBedWTww?t=2624) through the missions of the Son and the  
[0:43:46](https://youtu.be/3k6MBedWTww?t=2626) Spirit my Muslim friends tell me that I  
[0:43:49](https://youtu.be/3k6MBedWTww?t=2629) should reject this confusing concept of  
[0:43:52](https://youtu.be/3k6MBedWTww?t=2632) God and believe in something much  
[0:43:54](https://youtu.be/3k6MBedWTww?t=2634) simpler the Islamic concept of God but  
[0:43:57](https://youtu.be/3k6MBedWTww?t=2637) I've been going through your sources for  
[0:43:59](https://youtu.be/3k6MBedWTww?t=2639) a good little while now and I see some  
[0:44:03](https://youtu.be/3k6MBedWTww?t=2643) serious problems with the doctrine of  
[0:44:05](https://youtu.be/3k6MBedWTww?t=2645) Touhey let me give you a few examples  
[0:44:08](https://youtu.be/3k6MBedWTww?t=2648) first Allah praise people ask Jesus is  
[0:44:13](https://youtu.be/3k6MBedWTww?t=2653) God why does he pray I have to remind  
[0:44:17](https://youtu.be/3k6MBedWTww?t=2657) them that we're Trinitarians makes  
[0:44:18](https://youtu.be/3k6MBedWTww?t=2658) perfect sense for the son to speak to  
[0:44:20](https://youtu.be/3k6MBedWTww?t=2660) the father  
[0:44:21](https://youtu.be/3k6MBedWTww?t=2661) makes much less sense given the Islamic  
[0:44:24](https://youtu.be/3k6MBedWTww?t=2664) concept of God for a lot to pray in  
[0:44:26](https://youtu.be/3k6MBedWTww?t=2666) surah 33 verse 56 of the Quran we read  
[0:44:30](https://youtu.be/3k6MBedWTww?t=2670) shortly Allah and his angels pray for  
[0:44:34](https://youtu.be/3k6MBedWTww?t=2674) the Prophet o you who believe  
[0:44:36](https://youtu.be/3k6MBedWTww?t=2676) pray for him and salute him with a  
[0:44:38](https://youtu.be/3k6MBedWTww?t=2678) worthy salutation Allah and his angels  
[0:44:40](https://youtu.be/3k6MBedWTww?t=2680) pray for the Prophet translators try to  
[0:44:45](https://youtu.be/3k6MBedWTww?t=2685) hide this by translating it as Allah and  
[0:44:48](https://youtu.be/3k6MBedWTww?t=2688) his angels send blessings or show mercy  
[0:44:51](https://youtu.be/3k6MBedWTww?t=2691) or they praise Him the problem here is  
[0:44:54](https://youtu.be/3k6MBedWTww?t=2694) that what it says Allah does is Salah  
[0:44:57](https://youtu.be/3k6MBedWTww?t=2697) and you know what that means you know  
[0:45:00](https://youtu.be/3k6MBedWTww?t=2700) there are perfectly good Arabic ways of  
[0:45:02](https://youtu.be/3k6MBedWTww?t=2702) saying all of those other things every  
[0:45:05](https://youtu.be/3k6MBedWTww?t=2705) Arab speaker in the world knows that  
[0:45:06](https://youtu.be/3k6MBedWTww?t=2706) Salah means prayer and it says that  
[0:45:09](https://youtu.be/3k6MBedWTww?t=2709) Allah does Salah so who is Allah praying  
[0:45:12](https://youtu.be/3k6MBedWTww?t=2712) to second according to the Quran most of  
[0:45:19](https://youtu.be/3k6MBedWTww?t=2719) Allah's parts will die the Quran and the  
[0:45:23](https://youtu.be/3k6MBedWTww?t=2723) hadith refer to a las face his hands to  
[0:45:27](https://youtu.be/3k6MBedWTww?t=2727) right hands in fact fingers waist Shin  
[0:45:30](https://youtu.be/3k6MBedWTww?t=2730) feet and so on now there's a tendency to  
[0:45:33](https://youtu.be/3k6MBedWTww?t=2733) interpret scriptural statements about  
[0:45:35](https://youtu.be/3k6MBedWTww?t=2735) God's bodily parts figuratively if we  
[0:45:38](https://youtu.be/3k6MBedWTww?t=2738) say God's eyes see everything no one  
[0:45:40](https://youtu.be/3k6MBedWTww?t=2740) thinks we're saying that God has  
[0:45:42](https://youtu.be/3k6MBedWTww?t=2742) eyeballs but there are most of the  
[0:45:45](https://youtu.be/3k6MBedWTww?t=2745) Muslim scholars themselves are the ones  
[0:45:48](https://youtu.be/3k6MBedWTww?t=2748) who are arguing that descriptions of a  
[0:45:51](https://youtu.be/3k6MBedWTww?t=2751) laws face and hands and feet and so on  
[0:45:54](https://youtu.be/3k6MBedWTww?t=2754) have to be interpreted literally not  
[0:45:57](https://youtu.be/3k6MBedWTww?t=2757) simply anthropomorphic Allah 10 minutes  
[0:46:00](https://youtu.be/3k6MBedWTww?t=2760) left so Allah has a literal face literal  
[0:46:03](https://youtu.be/3k6MBedWTww?t=2763) hands and so on and yet we read in the  
[0:46:07](https://youtu.be/3k6MBedWTww?t=2767) Quran Sura  
[0:46:08](https://youtu.be/3k6MBedWTww?t=2768) 28 verse 88 everything will perish  
[0:46:13](https://youtu.be/3k6MBedWTww?t=2773) except a laws face which means if you  
[0:46:18](https://youtu.be/3k6MBedWTww?t=2778) arts if you are taking these parts  
[0:46:20](https://youtu.be/3k6MBedWTww?t=2780) literally and the only thing that  
[0:46:22](https://youtu.be/3k6MBedWTww?t=2782) survives is a laws face then allows face  
[0:46:25](https://youtu.be/3k6MBedWTww?t=2785) has different attributes from the rest  
[0:46:26](https://youtu.be/3k6MBedWTww?t=2786) of his parts perishable versus  
[0:46:29](https://youtu.be/3k6MBedWTww?t=2789) imperishable third the Quran  
[0:46:33](https://youtu.be/3k6MBedWTww?t=2793) is an eternal person while Orthodox  
[0:46:39](https://youtu.be/3k6MBedWTww?t=2799) Islamic theology insists that the Quran  
[0:46:42](https://youtu.be/3k6MBedWTww?t=2802) is the uncreated speech of Allah and Co  
[0:46:45](https://youtu.be/3k6MBedWTww?t=2805) eternal with Allah that would be  
[0:46:47](https://youtu.be/3k6MBedWTww?t=2807) interesting enough we can't forget that  
[0:46:49](https://youtu.be/3k6MBedWTww?t=2809) according to Muhammad the Quran is also  
[0:46:52](https://youtu.be/3k6MBedWTww?t=2812) a person who intercedes for Muslims and  
[0:46:54](https://youtu.be/3k6MBedWTww?t=2814) Sahih Muslim 1874 Muhammad says to his  
[0:46:57](https://youtu.be/3k6MBedWTww?t=2817) companions recite the Quran for it will  
[0:47:00](https://youtu.be/3k6MBedWTww?t=2820) come on the Day of Resurrection  
[0:47:02](https://youtu.be/3k6MBedWTww?t=2822) interceding for its companions now how  
[0:47:06](https://youtu.be/3k6MBedWTww?t=2826) can a book intercede for people  
[0:47:09](https://youtu.be/3k6MBedWTww?t=2829) Muhammad explains in musnad ahmed and  
[0:47:11](https://youtu.be/3k6MBedWTww?t=2831) Sunnah inhibin maha where he says the  
[0:47:14](https://youtu.be/3k6MBedWTww?t=2834) quran will meet its companion on the day  
[0:47:17](https://youtu.be/3k6MBedWTww?t=2837) of resurrection when his grave is open  
[0:47:19](https://youtu.be/3k6MBedWTww?t=2839) for him in the form of a pale man the  
[0:47:23](https://youtu.be/3k6MBedWTww?t=2843) Quran will say to him do you recognise  
[0:47:25](https://youtu.be/3k6MBedWTww?t=2845) me he will say I do not recognise you it  
[0:47:27](https://youtu.be/3k6MBedWTww?t=2847) will say I am your companion the Quran  
[0:47:29](https://youtu.be/3k6MBedWTww?t=2849) who kept you thirsty on hot days and  
[0:47:31](https://youtu.be/3k6MBedWTww?t=2851) kept you awake at night so the Quran  
[0:47:34](https://youtu.be/3k6MBedWTww?t=2854) which is eternal and uncreated appears  
[0:47:36](https://youtu.be/3k6MBedWTww?t=2856) as a pale man speaks to Muslims and then  
[0:47:38](https://youtu.be/3k6MBedWTww?t=2858) speaks to Allah on their behalf again  
[0:47:41](https://youtu.be/3k6MBedWTww?t=2861) this person this pale man is eternal  
[0:47:48](https://youtu.be/3k6MBedWTww?t=2868) fourth the Quran isn't just personal  
[0:47:51](https://youtu.be/3k6MBedWTww?t=2871) it's multi personal and I hear from  
[0:47:54](https://youtu.be/3k6MBedWTww?t=2874) Muslims that that's impossible even  
[0:47:57](https://youtu.be/3k6MBedWTww?t=2877) though the Quran is an eternal person  
[0:47:59](https://youtu.be/3k6MBedWTww?t=2879) who appears as a pale man and intercedes  
[0:48:01](https://youtu.be/3k6MBedWTww?t=2881) for Muslims there are actually multiple  
[0:48:03](https://youtu.be/3k6MBedWTww?t=2883) persons within the one nature of the  
[0:48:05](https://youtu.be/3k6MBedWTww?t=2885) Quran in Sunan Abu Dawood 1400 Muhammad  
[0:48:11](https://youtu.be/3k6MBedWTww?t=2891) said there is a surah in the Quran which  
[0:48:13](https://youtu.be/3k6MBedWTww?t=2893) consists of 30 verses is referring to  
[0:48:16](https://youtu.be/3k6MBedWTww?t=2896) surah Elmo it will intercede for its  
[0:48:20](https://youtu.be/3k6MBedWTww?t=2900) companion until he is forgiven so a  
[0:48:24](https://youtu.be/3k6MBedWTww?t=2904) specific chapter of the Quran can appear  
[0:48:26](https://youtu.be/3k6MBedWTww?t=2906) and intercede for those who read it but  
[0:48:30](https://youtu.be/3k6MBedWTww?t=2910) Muhammad isn't done so he Muslim 1874 he  
[0:48:34](https://youtu.be/3k6MBedWTww?t=2914) tells his followers to recite Surat  
[0:48:36](https://youtu.be/3k6MBedWTww?t=2916) al-baqarah and sura al-imran because  
[0:48:38](https://youtu.be/3k6MBedWTww?t=2918) these surahs will come as two flocks of  
[0:48:41](https://youtu.be/3k6MBedWTww?t=2921) birds on the day of resurrection  
[0:48:44](https://youtu.be/3k6MBedWTww?t=2924) on behalf of the Muslims who recited  
[0:48:47](https://youtu.be/3k6MBedWTww?t=2927) them since Mohammed mentions three  
[0:48:51](https://youtu.be/3k6MBedWTww?t=2931) different sorts of the Quran which have  
[0:48:54](https://youtu.be/3k6MBedWTww?t=2934) their own distinct personalities their  
[0:48:55](https://youtu.be/3k6MBedWTww?t=2935) own knowledge I think we can say that  
[0:48:58](https://youtu.be/3k6MBedWTww?t=2938) all of the surahs of the Quran have  
[0:49:01](https://youtu.be/3k6MBedWTww?t=2941) their own distinct personalities the  
[0:49:02](https://youtu.be/3k6MBedWTww?t=2942) Quran Muslims read today is thus one in  
[0:49:05](https://youtu.be/3k6MBedWTww?t=2945) essence as the word of Allah but a  
[0:49:08](https://youtu.be/3k6MBedWTww?t=2948) hundred and fourteen in person the  
[0:49:11](https://youtu.be/3k6MBedWTww?t=2951) personal chapters come as flocks of  
[0:49:13](https://youtu.be/3k6MBedWTww?t=2953) birds pleading on behalf of Muslims I  
[0:49:16](https://youtu.be/3k6MBedWTww?t=2956) see lots of Muslims smiling and laughing  
[0:49:17](https://youtu.be/3k6MBedWTww?t=2957) at this is what your prophet said your  
[0:49:19](https://youtu.be/3k6MBedWTww?t=2959) prophet I think it's funny too but I try  
[0:49:23](https://youtu.be/3k6MBedWTww?t=2963) to I try to try to hide that a little  
[0:49:25](https://youtu.be/3k6MBedWTww?t=2965) bit fifth the multi personal Quran has a  
[0:49:31](https://youtu.be/3k6MBedWTww?t=2971) mother Christians claim that Jesus is  
[0:49:34](https://youtu.be/3k6MBedWTww?t=2974) the Son of God the Quran responds sir 6  
[0:49:37](https://youtu.be/3k6MBedWTww?t=2977) verse 101 how can a lot have a son when  
[0:49:39](https://youtu.be/3k6MBedWTww?t=2979) he has no wife notice that the Quran  
[0:49:42](https://youtu.be/3k6MBedWTww?t=2982) discern assumes that filial terms taught  
[0:49:44](https://youtu.be/3k6MBedWTww?t=2984) terms referring to offspring have to be  
[0:49:47](https://youtu.be/3k6MBedWTww?t=2987) interpreted in a biological sense well  
[0:49:50](https://youtu.be/3k6MBedWTww?t=2990) if we can only understand these terms  
[0:49:52](https://youtu.be/3k6MBedWTww?t=2992) biologically we have to ask about the  
[0:49:54](https://youtu.be/3k6MBedWTww?t=2994) qur'an's mother  
[0:49:55](https://youtu.be/3k6MBedWTww?t=2995) so our 13 verse 39 Allah blots out what  
[0:49:58](https://youtu.be/3k6MBedWTww?t=2998) He wills and confirms what He wills and  
[0:50:00](https://youtu.be/3k6MBedWTww?t=3000) with him is the mother of the book boom  
[0:50:03](https://youtu.be/3k6MBedWTww?t=3003) al-kitab the Quran x' mother is in the  
[0:50:07](https://youtu.be/3k6MBedWTww?t=3007) presence of allah i would normally be  
[0:50:09](https://youtu.be/3k6MBedWTww?t=3009) happy with some metaphorical meaning of  
[0:50:12](https://youtu.be/3k6MBedWTww?t=3012) something like that but it's the quran  
[0:50:14](https://youtu.be/3k6MBedWTww?t=3014) itself which says that we have to  
[0:50:15](https://youtu.be/3k6MBedWTww?t=3015) interpret claims about Jesus being the  
[0:50:17](https://youtu.be/3k6MBedWTww?t=3017) Son of God biologically so if we have to  
[0:50:21](https://youtu.be/3k6MBedWTww?t=3021) interpret these claims biologically then  
[0:50:23](https://youtu.be/3k6MBedWTww?t=3023) I have to say if the Quran has a mommy  
[0:50:26](https://youtu.be/3k6MBedWTww?t=3026) who's the daddy 6 Allah spirit who is  
[0:50:33](https://youtu.be/3k6MBedWTww?t=3033) eternal and the co-creator of life is a  
[0:50:37](https://youtu.be/3k6MBedWTww?t=3037) person according to Islamic theology  
[0:50:40](https://youtu.be/3k6MBedWTww?t=3040) nothing that is a part of Allah or that  
[0:50:42](https://youtu.be/3k6MBedWTww?t=3042) originates from within Allah is created  
[0:50:46](https://youtu.be/3k6MBedWTww?t=3046) but the Quran says that Allah breathes  
[0:50:48](https://youtu.be/3k6MBedWTww?t=3048) out his spirit  
[0:50:50](https://youtu.be/3k6MBedWTww?t=3050) this means that like Allah is eternal  
[0:50:52](https://youtu.be/3k6MBedWTww?t=3052) speech the spirit comes from within  
[0:50:54](https://youtu.be/3k6MBedWTww?t=3054) Allah and is thus uncreated and it  
[0:50:57](https://youtu.be/3k6MBedWTww?t=3057) Colonel Allah creates man insert of 15  
[0:51:01](https://youtu.be/3k6MBedWTww?t=3061) by fashioning a body out of clay men  
[0:51:03](https://youtu.be/3k6MBedWTww?t=3063) breathing a spear hydrants left the  
[0:51:05](https://youtu.be/3k6MBedWTww?t=3065) Quran says that Allah strengthens Jesus  
[0:51:08](https://youtu.be/3k6MBedWTww?t=3068) by the Spirit and that the that he  
[0:51:10](https://youtu.be/3k6MBedWTww?t=3070) strengthens all true believers with the  
[0:51:12](https://youtu.be/3k6MBedWTww?t=3072) spirit but the Spirit is a conscious  
[0:51:16](https://youtu.be/3k6MBedWTww?t=3076) agents who can appear in the form of a  
[0:51:18](https://youtu.be/3k6MBedWTww?t=3078) man the spirit appears to Mary and  
[0:51:20](https://youtu.be/3k6MBedWTww?t=3080) speaks to her in surah 19 and then  
[0:51:22](https://youtu.be/3k6MBedWTww?t=3082) breathes into her just as Allah breathed  
[0:51:24](https://youtu.be/3k6MBedWTww?t=3084) into clay to create Adam so the Spirit  
[0:51:29](https://youtu.be/3k6MBedWTww?t=3089) is an uncreated eternal co-creator who  
[0:51:32](https://youtu.be/3k6MBedWTww?t=3092) is sent by Allah in the form of a man to  
[0:51:35](https://youtu.be/3k6MBedWTww?t=3095) perform certain tasks and if he can  
[0:51:39](https://youtu.be/3k6MBedWTww?t=3099) strengthen believers wherever they are  
[0:51:41](https://youtu.be/3k6MBedWTww?t=3101) he would have to be omnipresent  
[0:51:45](https://youtu.be/3k6MBedWTww?t=3105) and some divine attributes all over the  
[0:51:47](https://youtu.be/3k6MBedWTww?t=3107) place here vii islam deifies Muhammad  
[0:51:53](https://youtu.be/3k6MBedWTww?t=3113) when Muhammad would spit his companions  
[0:51:57](https://youtu.be/3k6MBedWTww?t=3117) would rush to collect the spit and they  
[0:51:59](https://youtu.be/3k6MBedWTww?t=3119) would rub it on their faces they would  
[0:52:04](https://youtu.be/3k6MBedWTww?t=3124) struggle to save his used ablution water  
[0:52:07](https://youtu.be/3k6MBedWTww?t=3127) if a hair fell off his head they would  
[0:52:09](https://youtu.be/3k6MBedWTww?t=3129) rush to grab it after the Battle of hood  
[0:52:12](https://youtu.be/3k6MBedWTww?t=3132) Muhammad's companions men named Malik  
[0:52:15](https://youtu.be/3k6MBedWTww?t=3135) collected the blood that ran from  
[0:52:17](https://youtu.be/3k6MBedWTww?t=3137) Muhammad's wound and drank it Muhammad  
[0:52:21](https://youtu.be/3k6MBedWTww?t=3141) said the fire will never touch you this  
[0:52:25](https://youtu.be/3k6MBedWTww?t=3145) isn't how you treat someone you regard  
[0:52:27](https://youtu.be/3k6MBedWTww?t=3147) as a mere human being today however no  
[0:52:31](https://youtu.be/3k6MBedWTww?t=3151) one can drink Muhammad's blood or rub  
[0:52:34](https://youtu.be/3k6MBedWTww?t=3154) his saliva on their faces but Muslims  
[0:52:37](https://youtu.be/3k6MBedWTww?t=3157) still address him directly in their  
[0:52:40](https://youtu.be/3k6MBedWTww?t=3160) prayers most of the time when lessons  
[0:52:42](https://youtu.be/3k6MBedWTww?t=3162) are praying they're reciting words that  
[0:52:44](https://youtu.be/3k6MBedWTww?t=3164) are directed towards Allah well there's  
[0:52:47](https://youtu.be/3k6MBedWTww?t=3167) a part of their daily prayers where they  
[0:52:48](https://youtu.be/3k6MBedWTww?t=3168) say assalamu alayka by johann the BU now  
[0:52:53](https://youtu.be/3k6MBedWTww?t=3173) that does not mean God please bless  
[0:52:57](https://youtu.be/3k6MBedWTww?t=3177) Muhammad that is peace be upon you  
[0:53:02](https://youtu.be/3k6MBedWTww?t=3182) Muhammad for speaking they're laughing  
[0:53:05](https://youtu.be/3k6MBedWTww?t=3185) and they're speaking directly to  
[0:53:06](https://youtu.be/3k6MBedWTww?t=3186) Muhammad in their daily prayers they're  
[0:53:08](https://youtu.be/3k6MBedWTww?t=3188) talking directly to Muhammad in their  
[0:53:10](https://youtu.be/3k6MBedWTww?t=3190) daily prayer this assumes that he can  
[0:53:12](https://youtu.be/3k6MBedWTww?t=3192) hear them and so he hears them all over  
[0:53:14](https://youtu.be/3k6MBedWTww?t=3194) the world in which case he must be  
[0:53:16](https://youtu.be/3k6MBedWTww?t=3196) omnipresent interesting for a mere human  
[0:53:19](https://youtu.be/3k6MBedWTww?t=3199) being viii Islam deifies Jesus without  
[0:53:26](https://youtu.be/3k6MBedWTww?t=3206) even realizing it  
[0:53:27](https://youtu.be/3k6MBedWTww?t=3207) Allah is uncreated and eternal but as  
[0:53:30](https://youtu.be/3k6MBedWTww?t=3210) we've seen there are two uncreated and  
[0:53:32](https://youtu.be/3k6MBedWTww?t=3212) eternal persons with Allah his word his  
[0:53:35](https://youtu.be/3k6MBedWTww?t=3215) eternal speech and the spirit that he  
[0:53:36](https://youtu.be/3k6MBedWTww?t=3216) breathes out and yet answer for verse  
[0:53:39](https://youtu.be/3k6MBedWTww?t=3219) 171 even when the Quran is asserting  
[0:53:41](https://youtu.be/3k6MBedWTww?t=3221) that he's only a prophet it refers to  
[0:53:43](https://youtu.be/3k6MBedWTww?t=3223) Jesus as a laws word and as a spirit  
[0:53:47](https://youtu.be/3k6MBedWTww?t=3227) from Allah as if this weren't enough  
[0:53:50](https://youtu.be/3k6MBedWTww?t=3230) Jesus goes on to create life in exactly  
[0:53:54](https://youtu.be/3k6MBedWTww?t=3234) the same way Allah creates life a lot of  
[0:53:56](https://youtu.be/3k6MBedWTww?t=3236) fashions of man out of clay and then  
[0:53:58](https://youtu.be/3k6MBedWTww?t=3238) breathes his spirit into it what does  
[0:54:00](https://youtu.be/3k6MBedWTww?t=3240) Jesus do he fashions a clay bird and  
[0:54:03](https://youtu.be/3k6MBedWTww?t=3243) then breathes his spirit into it and  
[0:54:06](https://youtu.be/3k6MBedWTww?t=3246) this gives life Jesus is co-creator no  
[0:54:10](https://youtu.be/3k6MBedWTww?t=3250) wonder his followers started worshipping  
[0:54:12](https://youtu.be/3k6MBedWTww?t=3252) him ix Islamic worship draws extensively  
[0:54:17](https://youtu.be/3k6MBedWTww?t=3257) from the polytheism of 7th century  
[0:54:20](https://youtu.be/3k6MBedWTww?t=3260) Arabia during the time of Muhammad the  
[0:54:24](https://youtu.be/3k6MBedWTww?t=3264) polytheists of Arabia would perform  
[0:54:25](https://youtu.be/3k6MBedWTww?t=3265) Tawaf walking circles around the Kaaba  
[0:54:28](https://youtu.be/3k6MBedWTww?t=3268) why did they do that because they were  
[0:54:30](https://youtu.be/3k6MBedWTww?t=3270) following Abraham no they believed in  
[0:54:34](https://youtu.be/3k6MBedWTww?t=3274) seven planetary deities who circled the  
[0:54:36](https://youtu.be/3k6MBedWTww?t=3276) earth and so they walked seven circles  
[0:54:39](https://youtu.be/3k6MBedWTww?t=3279) around the Kaaba in order to honor these  
[0:54:41](https://youtu.be/3k6MBedWTww?t=3281) seven planetary deities Muslims do the  
[0:54:43](https://youtu.be/3k6MBedWTww?t=3283) same today but not realizing where the  
[0:54:45](https://youtu.be/3k6MBedWTww?t=3285) practice came from there's also the  
[0:54:49](https://youtu.be/3k6MBedWTww?t=3289) black stone this was one of the pagan  
[0:54:52](https://youtu.be/3k6MBedWTww?t=3292) idols became part of Islam you kiss it  
[0:54:54](https://youtu.be/3k6MBedWTww?t=3294) and it can be an expiation for your sins  
[0:54:57](https://youtu.be/3k6MBedWTww?t=3297) but according to Muhammad the black  
[0:54:59](https://youtu.be/3k6MBedWTww?t=3299) stone itself is conscious one minute  
[0:55:03](https://youtu.be/3k6MBedWTww?t=3303) left  
[0:55:03](https://youtu.be/3k6MBedWTww?t=3303) we read intermit II and Nibin Maha The  
[0:55:06](https://youtu.be/3k6MBedWTww?t=3306) Messenger of Allah said concerning the  
[0:55:08](https://youtu.be/3k6MBedWTww?t=3308) stone by Allah Allah  
[0:55:10](https://youtu.be/3k6MBedWTww?t=3310) bring it forth on the day of  
[0:55:11](https://youtu.be/3k6MBedWTww?t=3311) resurrection and will have two eyes with  
[0:55:14](https://youtu.be/3k6MBedWTww?t=3314) which it will see and a tongue with  
[0:55:16](https://youtu.be/3k6MBedWTww?t=3316) which it will speak and it will testify  
[0:55:17](https://youtu.be/3k6MBedWTww?t=3317) in favor of those who touched it in  
[0:55:19](https://youtu.be/3k6MBedWTww?t=3319) sincerity so this isn't a random  
[0:55:21](https://youtu.be/3k6MBedWTww?t=3321) lifeless Idol this is a living breathing  
[0:55:25](https://youtu.be/3k6MBedWTww?t=3325) Idol so in the Quran we've got a loss  
[0:55:32](https://youtu.be/3k6MBedWTww?t=3332) wearing by literally everything we'll be  
[0:55:37](https://youtu.be/3k6MBedWTww?t=3337) talking about that in a little in a few  
[0:55:38](https://youtu.be/3k6MBedWTww?t=3338) moments given that we find these things  
[0:55:43](https://youtu.be/3k6MBedWTww?t=3343) in the Muslim sources  
[0:55:46](https://youtu.be/3k6MBedWTww?t=3346) I'm truly interested in how we can sit  
[0:55:49](https://youtu.be/3k6MBedWTww?t=3349) here and poke fun at the doctrine of the  
[0:55:51](https://youtu.be/3k6MBedWTww?t=3351) Trinity now the real basis I find for  
[0:55:56](https://youtu.be/3k6MBedWTww?t=3356) reconciling these texts with the  
[0:55:59](https://youtu.be/3k6MBedWTww?t=3359) doctrine of tell heed is that Muslim  
[0:56:01](https://youtu.be/3k6MBedWTww?t=3361) scholars don't let you know this stuff  
[0:56:04](https://youtu.be/3k6MBedWTww?t=3364) which is why you think it's funny when  
[0:56:05](https://youtu.be/3k6MBedWTww?t=3365) you're hearing it  
[0:56:06](https://youtu.be/3k6MBedWTww?t=3366) time is up dr. wood  
[0:56:13](https://youtu.be/3k6MBedWTww?t=3373) now we're gonna start our second part  
[0:56:15](https://youtu.be/3k6MBedWTww?t=3375) which is the the 12 minute rebuttal and  
[0:56:18](https://youtu.be/3k6MBedWTww?t=3378) going first is mr. Mahatma hijab and you  
[0:56:20](https://youtu.be/3k6MBedWTww?t=3380) can go ahead I think that would have  
[0:56:23](https://youtu.be/3k6MBedWTww?t=3383) said some career-ending embarrassing  
[0:56:24](https://youtu.be/3k6MBedWTww?t=3384) statements today I mean to be honest  
[0:56:26](https://youtu.be/3k6MBedWTww?t=3386) with you  
[0:56:32](https://youtu.be/3k6MBedWTww?t=3392) after 20 years of researching Islam you  
[0:56:35](https://youtu.be/3k6MBedWTww?t=3395) come with this okay  
[0:56:37](https://youtu.be/3k6MBedWTww?t=3397) let's deal with one one-by-one spirits  
[0:56:40](https://youtu.be/3k6MBedWTww?t=3400) of God hovered over the hovered over  
[0:56:44](https://youtu.be/3k6MBedWTww?t=3404) after the God created the heavens in the  
[0:56:46](https://youtu.be/3k6MBedWTww?t=3406) earth  
[0:56:47](https://youtu.be/3k6MBedWTww?t=3407) okay no problem it's that's meant to be  
[0:56:49](https://youtu.be/3k6MBedWTww?t=3409) God no problem let's go to Zacharias in  
[0:56:53](https://youtu.be/3k6MBedWTww?t=3413) Old Testament chapter 6 verse 5 there  
[0:56:55](https://youtu.be/3k6MBedWTww?t=3415) are 4 spirits so are there seven gods  
[0:56:57](https://youtu.be/3k6MBedWTww?t=3417) now because the word in Hebrew is Roja  
[0:57:00](https://youtu.be/3k6MBedWTww?t=3420) and you wouldn't know about Hebrew  
[0:57:02](https://youtu.be/3k6MBedWTww?t=3422) because look I I think not only do you  
[0:57:05](https://youtu.be/3k6MBedWTww?t=3425) not know Arabic but you don't know  
[0:57:07](https://youtu.be/3k6MBedWTww?t=3427) Hebrew and you're making a big mistake  
[0:57:08](https://youtu.be/3k6MBedWTww?t=3428) by trying to interpret the biblical text  
[0:57:11](https://youtu.be/3k6MBedWTww?t=3431) in this way there's two words for  
[0:57:13](https://youtu.be/3k6MBedWTww?t=3433) spirits in Hebrew language the raw which  
[0:57:15](https://youtu.be/3k6MBedWTww?t=3435) is the same as the Arabic in the WA the  
[0:57:16](https://youtu.be/3k6MBedWTww?t=3436) word rock is here in Zechariah chapter  
[0:57:20](https://youtu.be/3k6MBedWTww?t=3440) six verse five talking about four  
[0:57:22](https://youtu.be/3k6MBedWTww?t=3442) spirits so tell us why if that is a  
[0:57:24](https://youtu.be/3k6MBedWTww?t=3444) spirit and it's God then how comes  
[0:57:25](https://youtu.be/3k6MBedWTww?t=3445) there's only three gods three persons of  
[0:57:27](https://youtu.be/3k6MBedWTww?t=3447) God and and there isn't seven for  
[0:57:31](https://youtu.be/3k6MBedWTww?t=3451) example he says that food that Jesus  
[0:57:36](https://youtu.be/3k6MBedWTww?t=3456) this is called the etymology fallacy  
[0:57:38](https://youtu.be/3k6MBedWTww?t=3458) that's you know he's been referred to in  
[0:57:40](https://youtu.be/3k6MBedWTww?t=3460) manual etc God is with us  
[0:57:42](https://youtu.be/3k6MBedWTww?t=3462) Elijah is also what Elijah in the in the  
[0:57:45](https://youtu.be/3k6MBedWTww?t=3465) Hebrew language means God is with us so  
[0:57:48](https://youtu.be/3k6MBedWTww?t=3468) if if that makes Jesus gods and the  
[0:57:50](https://youtu.be/3k6MBedWTww?t=3470) larger is also a God we move on where  
[0:57:54](https://youtu.be/3k6MBedWTww?t=3474) else did he say  
[0:57:54](https://youtu.be/3k6MBedWTww?t=3474) I am statement if you look at the New  
[0:57:57](https://youtu.be/3k6MBedWTww?t=3477) International Version of the Bible the I  
[0:58:00](https://youtu.be/3k6MBedWTww?t=3480) am is actually not translated as I am  
[0:58:03](https://youtu.be/3k6MBedWTww?t=3483) but I will be and there's a whole  
[0:58:05](https://youtu.be/3k6MBedWTww?t=3485) discussion on that and to be honest with  
[0:58:07](https://youtu.be/3k6MBedWTww?t=3487) you frankly I don't even take the Gospel  
[0:58:10](https://youtu.be/3k6MBedWTww?t=3490) of John to be completely authoritative  
[0:58:12](https://youtu.be/3k6MBedWTww?t=3492) and neither do the majority of biblical  
[0:58:14](https://youtu.be/3k6MBedWTww?t=3494) scholars anyways 95 ad it's a long way  
[0:58:19](https://youtu.be/3k6MBedWTww?t=3499) he says Allah says that Allah is on the  
[0:58:22](https://youtu.be/3k6MBedWTww?t=3502) island Nabi and he's here saying that he  
[0:58:24](https://youtu.be/3k6MBedWTww?t=3504) prays to the Prophet there's a  
[0:58:27](https://youtu.be/3k6MBedWTww?t=3507) difference between you suddenly laho and  
[0:58:29](https://youtu.be/3k6MBedWTww?t=3509) you saw the ILA  
[0:58:30](https://youtu.be/3k6MBedWTww?t=3510) in the Arabic language I knew this was  
[0:58:32](https://youtu.be/3k6MBedWTww?t=3512) going to happen  
[0:58:35](https://youtu.be/3k6MBedWTww?t=3515) I knew I was going to have to give you a  
[0:58:39](https://youtu.be/3k6MBedWTww?t=3519) free Arabic lesson here today I knew it  
[0:58:43](https://youtu.be/3k6MBedWTww?t=3523) and that's why the translators put four  
[0:58:46](https://youtu.be/3k6MBedWTww?t=3526) not to the profit you don't know what  
[0:58:50](https://youtu.be/3k6MBedWTww?t=3530) the words in Arabic meaning daunting  
[0:58:51](https://youtu.be/3k6MBedWTww?t=3531) here speak so solid this even come on  
[0:58:53](https://youtu.be/3k6MBedWTww?t=3533) please don't immerse yourself  
[0:58:54](https://youtu.be/3k6MBedWTww?t=3534) Allah has parts he says Muslim scholars  
[0:58:57](https://youtu.be/3k6MBedWTww?t=3537) say we should take this literally which  
[0:58:59](https://youtu.be/3k6MBedWTww?t=3539) wisdom scholars which was them scholars  
[0:59:03](https://youtu.be/3k6MBedWTww?t=3543) he says kulla shay'in helical ilaha in  
[0:59:06](https://youtu.be/3k6MBedWTww?t=3546) surah al-qasas chapter 20 of the quran  
[0:59:08](https://youtu.be/3k6MBedWTww?t=3548) means everything is destroyed except for  
[0:59:09](https://youtu.be/3k6MBedWTww?t=3549) his face and this means that allah all  
[0:59:11](https://youtu.be/3k6MBedWTww?t=3551) his body parts will be destroyed he has  
[0:59:13](https://youtu.be/3k6MBedWTww?t=3553) body parts and these things first of all  
[0:59:15](https://youtu.be/3k6MBedWTww?t=3555) the word cool in arabic doesn't  
[0:59:16](https://youtu.be/3k6MBedWTww?t=3556) necessarily mean all a sub hero book  
[0:59:18](https://youtu.be/3k6MBedWTww?t=3558) alcool vomited on and he said and he  
[0:59:21](https://youtu.be/3k6MBedWTww?t=3561) shows with examples that what cool  
[0:59:23](https://youtu.be/3k6MBedWTww?t=3563) doesn't mean all I'll give an example in  
[0:59:24](https://youtu.be/3k6MBedWTww?t=3564) chapter 46 of Quran so - aha - damn  
[0:59:27](https://youtu.be/3k6MBedWTww?t=3567) Miroku Lucia in Vietnam behind fast bahu  
[0:59:30](https://youtu.be/3k6MBedWTww?t=3570) that you are in lemma Sakina whom that  
[0:59:33](https://youtu.be/3k6MBedWTww?t=3573) the wind destroyed everything cool - a  
[0:59:36](https://youtu.be/3k6MBedWTww?t=3576) the same words here in pseudo-classes  
[0:59:38](https://youtu.be/3k6MBedWTww?t=3578) everything was destroyed except for the  
[0:59:40](https://youtu.be/3k6MBedWTww?t=3580) houses if it meant every single thing it  
[0:59:42](https://youtu.be/3k6MBedWTww?t=3582) wouldn't have been there houses would  
[0:59:43](https://youtu.be/3k6MBedWTww?t=3583) not be there  
[0:59:43](https://youtu.be/3k6MBedWTww?t=3583) so what cool doesn't mean that an Arabic  
[0:59:45](https://youtu.be/3k6MBedWTww?t=3585) language once again it's a problem with  
[0:59:47](https://youtu.be/3k6MBedWTww?t=3587) language he says that this is exactly  
[0:59:51](https://youtu.be/3k6MBedWTww?t=3591) his words he said the Quran is eternal  
[0:59:53](https://youtu.be/3k6MBedWTww?t=3593) person tell me one scholar in the  
[0:59:55](https://youtu.be/3k6MBedWTww?t=3595) history of Islam who said that this is a  
[0:59:56](https://youtu.be/3k6MBedWTww?t=3596) lie  
[1:00:00](https://youtu.be/3k6MBedWTww?t=3600) he says the Quran is a you have to it  
[1:00:05](https://youtu.be/3k6MBedWTww?t=3605) will come as a Shaffir on the day of  
[1:00:06](https://youtu.be/3k6MBedWTww?t=3606) judgement so if this is the question the  
[1:00:08](https://youtu.be/3k6MBedWTww?t=3608) output Butterfree I'll help you yeah if  
[1:00:10](https://youtu.be/3k6MBedWTww?t=3610) the Quran is an attribute of God how can  
[1:00:13](https://youtu.be/3k6MBedWTww?t=3613) it intercede for you this is what he's  
[1:00:14](https://youtu.be/3k6MBedWTww?t=3614) saying right it's a good question  
[1:00:16](https://youtu.be/3k6MBedWTww?t=3616) this is a good question well it's not a  
[1:00:18](https://youtu.be/3k6MBedWTww?t=3618) proper understanding of the hadith this  
[1:00:20](https://youtu.be/3k6MBedWTww?t=3620) is the only good question you had I'll  
[1:00:21](https://youtu.be/3k6MBedWTww?t=3621) give it to you it's the only good  
[1:00:23](https://youtu.be/3k6MBedWTww?t=3623) question you have the hadith says EPCOT  
[1:00:26](https://youtu.be/3k6MBedWTww?t=3626) al-quran so it's not the Quran ie the  
[1:00:30](https://youtu.be/3k6MBedWTww?t=3630) attribute of a lot that will intercede  
[1:00:32](https://youtu.be/3k6MBedWTww?t=3632) for you on the day of judgment but it is  
[1:00:33](https://youtu.be/3k6MBedWTww?t=3633) your Kira of the Quran and the Sarah you  
[1:00:36](https://youtu.be/3k6MBedWTww?t=3636) gave the Quran which means the reward  
[1:00:37](https://youtu.be/3k6MBedWTww?t=3637) you get from the recitation of the Quran  
[1:00:39](https://youtu.be/3k6MBedWTww?t=3639) not the Quran as an attribute of Allah  
[1:00:45](https://youtu.be/3k6MBedWTww?t=3645) he says their form is 114 passes of the  
[1:00:48](https://youtu.be/3k6MBedWTww?t=3648) Quran - Koko a fallacy - Koko a fallacy  
[1:00:51](https://youtu.be/3k6MBedWTww?t=3651) I told you do it and appeal to hypocracy  
[1:00:53](https://youtu.be/3k6MBedWTww?t=3653) so hey are you admitting that having  
[1:00:55](https://youtu.be/3k6MBedWTww?t=3655) more than one person or the being of God  
[1:00:57](https://youtu.be/3k6MBedWTww?t=3657) is wrong because you should lead  
[1:00:59](https://youtu.be/3k6MBedWTww?t=3659) trinitarianism then well obviously as we  
[1:01:02](https://youtu.be/3k6MBedWTww?t=3662) know there's no one in the history of  
[1:01:03](https://youtu.be/3k6MBedWTww?t=3663) Islam that referred to the surah of the  
[1:01:05](https://youtu.be/3k6MBedWTww?t=3665) Quran as persons this is wrong you don't  
[1:01:07](https://youtu.be/3k6MBedWTww?t=3667) know about Islam here you're being  
[1:01:08](https://youtu.be/3k6MBedWTww?t=3668) educated he said well I'm tech would  
[1:01:11](https://youtu.be/3k6MBedWTww?t=3671) level sake but he didn't know the Arabic  
[1:01:13](https://youtu.be/3k6MBedWTww?t=3673) but I'm going to give him the Arabic in  
[1:01:14](https://youtu.be/3k6MBedWTww?t=3674) chapter 6 verse hundred eight of the  
[1:01:16](https://youtu.be/3k6MBedWTww?t=3676) Quran where Allah says that Allah does  
[1:01:18](https://youtu.be/3k6MBedWTww?t=3678) not have a mate so does this mean what  
[1:01:21](https://youtu.be/3k6MBedWTww?t=3681) does this mean that biological they had  
[1:01:24](https://youtu.be/3k6MBedWTww?t=3684) the discussion of apology really and  
[1:01:25](https://youtu.be/3k6MBedWTww?t=3685) truly how can you have a begotten son  
[1:01:27](https://youtu.be/3k6MBedWTww?t=3687) there's only three options number one  
[1:01:29](https://youtu.be/3k6MBedWTww?t=3689) biology number two  
[1:01:30](https://youtu.be/3k6MBedWTww?t=3690) adoption and number three metaphor and  
[1:01:33](https://youtu.be/3k6MBedWTww?t=3693) if you say it's not biology and it's not  
[1:01:35](https://youtu.be/3k6MBedWTww?t=3695) adoption it must be a metaphor so Jesus  
[1:01:36](https://youtu.be/3k6MBedWTww?t=3696) is not a son of God okay and then he  
[1:01:45](https://youtu.be/3k6MBedWTww?t=3705) says that the prophets they play no they  
[1:01:47](https://youtu.be/3k6MBedWTww?t=3707) tried to get his hair and the spit and  
[1:01:49](https://youtu.be/3k6MBedWTww?t=3709) these things okay well if you think  
[1:01:51](https://youtu.be/3k6MBedWTww?t=3711) spearing once someone makes you a god  
[1:01:53](https://youtu.be/3k6MBedWTww?t=3713) well that's what he implies then I  
[1:01:55](https://youtu.be/3k6MBedWTww?t=3715) wonder why you look at every other verse  
[1:01:57](https://youtu.be/3k6MBedWTww?t=3717) of the Bible as implying that Jesus was  
[1:01:59](https://youtu.be/3k6MBedWTww?t=3719) God because for you as spit that's  
[1:02:04](https://youtu.be/3k6MBedWTww?t=3724) that's making me a god now I mean  
[1:02:09](https://youtu.be/3k6MBedWTww?t=3729) don't embarrass yourself in front of me  
[1:02:13](https://youtu.be/3k6MBedWTww?t=3733) assalamu alayka is that this means that  
[1:02:15](https://youtu.be/3k6MBedWTww?t=3735) he's interceding because it's a  
[1:02:17](https://youtu.be/3k6MBedWTww?t=3737) narrative voice assalamu alayka we say  
[1:02:20](https://youtu.be/3k6MBedWTww?t=3740) this in the shout every time it's a  
[1:02:22](https://youtu.be/3k6MBedWTww?t=3742) narrative voice however let's not say  
[1:02:24](https://youtu.be/3k6MBedWTww?t=3744) it's a narrative voice let's give it to  
[1:02:25](https://youtu.be/3k6MBedWTww?t=3745) him he says this must mean that the  
[1:02:27](https://youtu.be/3k6MBedWTww?t=3747) Prophet Muhammad is omnipresent yes he's  
[1:02:30](https://youtu.be/3k6MBedWTww?t=3750) omnipresent let's let's have fun with  
[1:02:32](https://youtu.be/3k6MBedWTww?t=3752) him today there is a hadith in Bukhari  
[1:02:34](https://youtu.be/3k6MBedWTww?t=3754) which says that whenever one person does  
[1:02:36](https://youtu.be/3k6MBedWTww?t=3756) Salah on the Nabi which means blessings  
[1:02:39](https://youtu.be/3k6MBedWTww?t=3759) and praise on the Prophet blessings on  
[1:02:42](https://youtu.be/3k6MBedWTww?t=3762) the Prophet the angel will carry that  
[1:02:44](https://youtu.be/3k6MBedWTww?t=3764) and give it to him  
[1:02:45](https://youtu.be/3k6MBedWTww?t=3765) it doesn't mean that he's hearing it  
[1:02:47](https://youtu.be/3k6MBedWTww?t=3767) everywhere the angel is moving around  
[1:02:49](https://youtu.be/3k6MBedWTww?t=3769) this is from the will of Allah and if  
[1:02:52](https://youtu.be/3k6MBedWTww?t=3772) you didn't know that now you do he says  
[1:02:57](https://youtu.be/3k6MBedWTww?t=3777) that kalamullah  
[1:02:59](https://youtu.be/3k6MBedWTww?t=3779) the eyes have been referred to as the  
[1:03:01](https://youtu.be/3k6MBedWTww?t=3781) word of Allah must mean that he is  
[1:03:03](https://youtu.be/3k6MBedWTww?t=3783) divine  
[1:03:03](https://youtu.be/3k6MBedWTww?t=3783) so although the Quran says clearly that  
[1:03:05](https://youtu.be/3k6MBedWTww?t=3785) he's not divine no it makes a mistake he  
[1:03:07](https://youtu.be/3k6MBedWTww?t=3787) is divine why you're all over the place  
[1:03:10](https://youtu.be/3k6MBedWTww?t=3790) you're fumbling all over the place it's  
[1:03:11](https://youtu.be/3k6MBedWTww?t=3791) embarrassing Karim Allah is is defined  
[1:03:14](https://youtu.be/3k6MBedWTww?t=3794) in chapter 3 verse 58 of the Quran  
[1:03:16](https://youtu.be/3k6MBedWTww?t=3796) well Allah subhana WA Ta'ala says in the  
[1:03:18](https://youtu.be/3k6MBedWTww?t=3798) methylase and the lie and the like a  
[1:03:20](https://youtu.be/3k6MBedWTww?t=3800) method leeadams ha ha ha woman robbing  
[1:03:22](https://youtu.be/3k6MBedWTww?t=3802) from mcaren fire kun five minutes left  
[1:03:27](https://youtu.be/3k6MBedWTww?t=3807) he said to him be and he was the world  
[1:03:29](https://youtu.be/3k6MBedWTww?t=3809) is defined in the Quran as B so Allah  
[1:03:32](https://youtu.be/3k6MBedWTww?t=3812) says B and things are just like he said  
[1:03:33](https://youtu.be/3k6MBedWTww?t=3813) being with Adam he said be with Jesus  
[1:03:35](https://youtu.be/3k6MBedWTww?t=3815) and he was he says that there are seven  
[1:03:39](https://youtu.be/3k6MBedWTww?t=3819) planetary things in Arabia and these  
[1:03:41](https://youtu.be/3k6MBedWTww?t=3821) things I mean how can you make a  
[1:03:43](https://youtu.be/3k6MBedWTww?t=3823) judgement first of all I haven't got  
[1:03:46](https://youtu.be/3k6MBedWTww?t=3826) reference for that I didn't see a rough  
[1:03:47](https://youtu.be/3k6MBedWTww?t=3827) he didn't say yes I give you a reference  
[1:03:49](https://youtu.be/3k6MBedWTww?t=3829) here it says Bukhari whatever even if  
[1:03:51](https://youtu.be/3k6MBedWTww?t=3831) he's got a reference how do you know  
[1:03:52](https://youtu.be/3k6MBedWTww?t=3832) that the practice originated from that  
[1:03:54](https://youtu.be/3k6MBedWTww?t=3834) and not from Abraham after all Abraham  
[1:03:56](https://youtu.be/3k6MBedWTww?t=3836) even in the Old Testament yes he existed  
[1:04:00](https://youtu.be/3k6MBedWTww?t=3840) pre existed before Jesus even though you  
[1:04:03](https://youtu.be/3k6MBedWTww?t=3843) have a yeah you know the physical Jesus  
[1:04:05](https://youtu.be/3k6MBedWTww?t=3845) and he was there in the desert and you  
[1:04:07](https://youtu.be/3k6MBedWTww?t=3847) have in the book of psalms mention of  
[1:04:08](https://youtu.be/3k6MBedWTww?t=3848) pilgrimage so if this is the case then I  
[1:04:12](https://youtu.be/3k6MBedWTww?t=3852) wonder why this is mentioned now this is  
[1:04:14](https://youtu.be/3k6MBedWTww?t=3854) I think this all that he kind of  
[1:04:16](https://youtu.be/3k6MBedWTww?t=3856) mentioned I want to give you one  
[1:04:18](https://youtu.be/3k6MBedWTww?t=3858) principle ladies and gentlemen that will  
[1:04:20](https://youtu.be/3k6MBedWTww?t=3860) destroy everything he said  
[1:04:21](https://youtu.be/3k6MBedWTww?t=3861) chapter 42 verse 11 laser chemistry  
[1:04:24](https://youtu.be/3k6MBedWTww?t=3864) shell horse Samuel massive that there's

[1:04:32](https://youtu.be/3k6MBedWTww?t=3872) see in the Quran talking about the hand  
[1:04:34](https://youtu.be/3k6MBedWTww?t=3874) talking about the face all of these  
[1:04:36](https://youtu.be/3k6MBedWTww?t=3876) things you can rest assured because of  
[1:04:39](https://youtu.be/3k6MBedWTww?t=3879) this verse and the other verse well a  
[1:04:40](https://youtu.be/3k6MBedWTww?t=3880) miracle out before now had that this  
[1:04:42](https://youtu.be/3k6MBedWTww?t=3882) means yes  
[1:04:43](https://youtu.be/3k6MBedWTww?t=3883) this means it cannot be compared to  
[1:04:46](https://youtu.be/3k6MBedWTww?t=3886) anything you imagine that was very cool  
[1:04:48](https://youtu.be/3k6MBedWTww?t=3888) observe over you little observe in the

[1:08:39](https://youtu.be/3k6MBedWTww?t=4119) stay on topic and be respectful towards  
[1:08:40](https://youtu.be/3k6MBedWTww?t=4120) the other speaker thank you and dr.  
[1:08:42](https://youtu.be/3k6MBedWTww?t=4122) David what do you have the floor thank  
[1:08:55](https://youtu.be/3k6MBedWTww?t=4135) you again Mohammad in my opening  
[1:08:58](https://youtu.be/3k6MBedWTww?t=4138) statement I laid out a basic case for  
[1:09:02](https://youtu.be/3k6MBedWTww?t=4142) the doctrine of the Trinity and I  
[1:09:04](https://youtu.be/3k6MBedWTww?t=4144) claimed that the Islamic concept of God  
[1:09:06](https://youtu.be/3k6MBedWTww?t=4146) is a more confusing than what we're  
[1:09:10](https://youtu.be/3k6MBedWTww?t=4150) normally told I pointed out that Allah  
[1:09:14](https://youtu.be/3k6MBedWTww?t=4154) prays and he said well there's a  
[1:09:16](https://youtu.be/3k6MBedWTww?t=4156) difference in the meaning of the verb  
[1:09:17](https://youtu.be/3k6MBedWTww?t=4157) here well the Quran says repeatedly that  
[1:09:20](https://youtu.be/3k6MBedWTww?t=4160) Allah prays and guess what he prays in  
[1:09:25](https://youtu.be/3k6MBedWTww?t=4165) the Hadees as well and what's  
[1:09:27](https://youtu.be/3k6MBedWTww?t=4167) interesting is there are even Muslim  
[1:09:29](https://youtu.be/3k6MBedWTww?t=4169) translators who are acknowledging this  
[1:09:30](https://youtu.be/3k6MBedWTww?t=4170) and translating these passages as Allah  
[1:09:34](https://youtu.be/3k6MBedWTww?t=4174) prays so I ship you Lee I've got a ton  
[1:09:37](https://youtu.be/3k6MBedWTww?t=4177) of them Islamic books translated by her  
[1:09:40](https://youtu.be/3k6MBedWTww?t=4180) respected around the world from riyad  
[1:09:44](https://youtu.be/3k6MBedWTww?t=4184) salihin The Messenger of Allah said  
[1:09:48](https://youtu.be/3k6MBedWTww?t=4188) Allah and His angels and the people of  
[1:09:51](https://youtu.be/3k6MBedWTww?t=4191) the heavens and the earth even the ants  
[1:09:53](https://youtu.be/3k6MBedWTww?t=4193) in their rocks and the fish pray for  
[1:09:56](https://youtu.be/3k6MBedWTww?t=4196) blessings on those who teach people good  
[1:10:01](https://youtu.be/3k6MBedWTww?t=4201) so Allah prays who's he praying to Allah  
[1:10:07](https://youtu.be/3k6MBedWTww?t=4207) hadith alkyd SIA translated again by a  
[1:10:10](https://youtu.be/3k6MBedWTww?t=4210) Muslim translator hadith number 216 the  
[1:10:14](https://youtu.be/3k6MBedWTww?t=4214) Israelites said to Moosa does your Lord  
[1:10:16](https://youtu.be/3k6MBedWTww?t=4216) pray moosa said fear allah o sons of  
[1:10:21](https://youtu.be/3k6MBedWTww?t=4221) israel Allah said o Moosa what did your  
[1:10:24](https://youtu.be/3k6MBedWTww?t=4224) people say will so said o my lord  
[1:10:27](https://youtu.be/3k6MBedWTww?t=4227) you already know they said does your  
[1:10:29](https://youtu.be/3k6MBedWTww?t=4229) Lord pray Allah said tell them  
[1:10:32](https://youtu.be/3k6MBedWTww?t=4232) prayer for my servants is that my mercy  
[1:10:35](https://youtu.be/3k6MBedWTww?t=4235) should precede my anger if it were not  
[1:10:39](https://youtu.be/3k6MBedWTww?t=4239) so I would have destroyed them Allah  
[1:10:42](https://youtu.be/3k6MBedWTww?t=4242) prays that his mercy will triumph over  
[1:10:45](https://youtu.be/3k6MBedWTww?t=4245) his wrath  
[1:10:47](https://youtu.be/3k6MBedWTww?t=4247) now if Allah is praying what he's  
[1:10:49](https://youtu.be/3k6MBedWTww?t=4249) praying for self-control here apparently  
[1:10:50](https://youtu.be/3k6MBedWTww?t=4250) right he wants to punish them but he  
[1:10:52](https://youtu.be/3k6MBedWTww?t=4252) prays for self-control this is not me  
[1:10:56](https://youtu.be/3k6MBedWTww?t=4256) this is these are your hadith and your  
[1:10:57](https://youtu.be/3k6MBedWTww?t=4257) translators translating these passages  
[1:10:59](https://youtu.be/3k6MBedWTww?t=4259) as Allah praying why because that's what  
[1:11:03](https://youtu.be/3k6MBedWTww?t=4263) Salah means if I'm wrong give me give me  
[1:11:08](https://youtu.be/3k6MBedWTww?t=4268) the linguistic basis for for saying  
[1:11:09](https://youtu.be/3k6MBedWTww?t=4269) otherwise second I said that Allah has  
[1:11:13](https://youtu.be/3k6MBedWTww?t=4273) various parts but only his face is  
[1:11:16](https://youtu.be/3k6MBedWTww?t=4276) imperishable which means that different  
[1:11:18](https://youtu.be/3k6MBedWTww?t=4278) parts of law have different attributes  
[1:11:20](https://youtu.be/3k6MBedWTww?t=4280) that's just what it says it says  
[1:11:23](https://youtu.be/3k6MBedWTww?t=4283) everything will perish except his face  
[1:11:27](https://youtu.be/3k6MBedWTww?t=4287) so if you're interpreting the parts as  
[1:11:30](https://youtu.be/3k6MBedWTww?t=4290) literal parts we've just got a problem  
[1:11:33](https://youtu.be/3k6MBedWTww?t=4293) here right it gives the qualification  
[1:11:35](https://youtu.be/3k6MBedWTww?t=4295) and saying everything will perish and I  
[1:11:37](https://youtu.be/3k6MBedWTww?t=4297) understand it can say you know  
[1:11:38](https://youtu.be/3k6MBedWTww?t=4298) everything this or everything that it's  
[1:11:39](https://youtu.be/3k6MBedWTww?t=4299) saying that everything perishes except  
[1:11:41](https://youtu.be/3k6MBedWTww?t=4301) his face it's drawing the only the only  
[1:11:43](https://youtu.be/3k6MBedWTww?t=4303) exception there which would mean that  
[1:11:46](https://youtu.be/3k6MBedWTww?t=4306) certain parts are parts with different  
[1:11:50](https://youtu.be/3k6MBedWTww?t=4310) attributes unless Allah is just not  
[1:11:53](https://youtu.be/3k6MBedWTww?t=4313) clear in his Quran which he claims to be  
[1:11:55](https://youtu.be/3k6MBedWTww?t=4315) clear over and over again third I said  
[1:11:59](https://youtu.be/3k6MBedWTww?t=4319) that the Quran is an eternal person  
[1:12:01](https://youtu.be/3k6MBedWTww?t=4321) these Allah is eternal word but he also  
[1:12:04](https://youtu.be/3k6MBedWTww?t=4324) takes the form of a pale man now it's  
[1:12:07](https://youtu.be/3k6MBedWTww?t=4327) kind of hard to hear because over there  
[1:12:09](https://youtu.be/3k6MBedWTww?t=4329) but I think Muhammad replied that it's  
[1:12:12](https://youtu.be/3k6MBedWTww?t=4332) your own recitation that appears to you  
[1:12:14](https://youtu.be/3k6MBedWTww?t=4334) now that's interesting enough if your  
[1:12:16](https://youtu.be/3k6MBedWTww?t=4336) own recitation of the Quran is appearing  
[1:12:18](https://youtu.be/3k6MBedWTww?t=4338) as a pale man but I don't think that's  
[1:12:23](https://youtu.be/3k6MBedWTww?t=4343) what it means because of the next point  
[1:12:25](https://youtu.be/3k6MBedWTww?t=4345) which is that individual chapters of the  
[1:12:27](https://youtu.be/3k6MBedWTww?t=4347) Quran appear as flocks of birds to  
[1:12:30](https://youtu.be/3k6MBedWTww?t=4350) intercede for you so if individual  
[1:12:32](https://youtu.be/3k6MBedWTww?t=4352) chapters of the Quran are appearing and  
[1:12:35](https://youtu.be/3k6MBedWTww?t=4355) pleading for you then why wouldn't the  
[1:12:40](https://youtu.be/3k6MBedWTww?t=4360) entire Quran as a whole also be  
[1:12:41](https://youtu.be/3k6MBedWTww?t=4361) appearing to you so it seems that it's  
[1:12:43](https://youtu.be/3k6MBedWTww?t=4363) not just talking about your own  
[1:12:44](https://youtu.be/3k6MBedWTww?t=4364) good recitation or something like that  
[1:12:46](https://youtu.be/3k6MBedWTww?t=4366) but the book itself he says I am the  
[1:12:49](https://youtu.be/3k6MBedWTww?t=4369) Quran now by the way this is a very  
[1:12:54](https://youtu.be/3k6MBedWTww?t=4374) interesting and I think it might be a  
[1:12:56](https://youtu.be/3k6MBedWTww?t=4376) source of problem here Mohammed says  
[1:13:02](https://youtu.be/3k6MBedWTww?t=4382) well who refers to these Quran chapters  
[1:13:04](https://youtu.be/3k6MBedWTww?t=4384) as persons and I think there's a little  
[1:13:07](https://youtu.be/3k6MBedWTww?t=4387) difficulty here this might be why he's  
[1:13:08](https://youtu.be/3k6MBedWTww?t=4388) having trouble understanding the doctor  
[1:13:11](https://youtu.be/3k6MBedWTww?t=4391) of the Trinity if he's if he's  
[1:13:12](https://youtu.be/3k6MBedWTww?t=4392) misunderstanding this word person here  
[1:13:14](https://youtu.be/3k6MBedWTww?t=4394) and and and how its applied if a flock  
[1:13:19](https://youtu.be/3k6MBedWTww?t=4399) of birds can talk and has knowledge and  
[1:13:24](https://youtu.be/3k6MBedWTww?t=4404) this flock of birds knows what you've  
[1:13:27](https://youtu.be/3k6MBedWTww?t=4407) been doing they know that you've been  
[1:13:29](https://youtu.be/3k6MBedWTww?t=4409) reciting the Quran they intercede for  
[1:13:32](https://youtu.be/3k6MBedWTww?t=4412) you they plead to Allah on your behalf  
[1:13:35](https://youtu.be/3k6MBedWTww?t=4415) well those are qualities of what we call  
[1:13:39](https://youtu.be/3k6MBedWTww?t=4419) a person in philosophy right it's  
[1:13:41](https://youtu.be/3k6MBedWTww?t=4421) communicating like that it has it has  
[1:13:43](https://youtu.be/3k6MBedWTww?t=4423) certain kinds of knowledge it it appeals  
[1:13:46](https://youtu.be/3k6MBedWTww?t=4426) to people in certain way this is what we  
[1:13:48](https://youtu.be/3k6MBedWTww?t=4428) mean by the term person and by the way  
[1:13:51](https://youtu.be/3k6MBedWTww?t=4431) because we're talking about origins of  
[1:13:54](https://youtu.be/3k6MBedWTww?t=4434) Islamic practices if you go to the early  
[1:13:58](https://youtu.be/3k6MBedWTww?t=4438) Islamic history there were goddesses  
[1:14:01](https://youtu.be/3k6MBedWTww?t=4441) there were many people in Arabia who  
[1:14:03](https://youtu.be/3k6MBedWTww?t=4443) believed in you know in a kind of  
[1:14:08](https://youtu.be/3k6MBedWTww?t=4448) hierarchy right where they believed in  
[1:14:10](https://youtu.be/3k6MBedWTww?t=4450) Allah and they believed that Allah was  
[1:14:11](https://youtu.be/3k6MBedWTww?t=4451) the main deity but they believed in  
[1:14:13](https://youtu.be/3k6MBedWTww?t=4453) lower deities and these were  
[1:14:15](https://youtu.be/3k6MBedWTww?t=4455) intercessors now a lot of loose and  
[1:14:17](https://youtu.be/3k6MBedWTww?t=4457) manat were three goddesses and they were  
[1:14:20](https://youtu.be/3k6MBedWTww?t=4460) called the exalted cranes they were the  
[1:14:23](https://youtu.be/3k6MBedWTww?t=4463) birds that would carry your prayers to  
[1:14:25](https://youtu.be/3k6MBedWTww?t=4465) Allah or they would fly up to Allah and  
[1:14:27](https://youtu.be/3k6MBedWTww?t=4467) intercede for you and why is this  
[1:14:29](https://youtu.be/3k6MBedWTww?t=4469) interesting well the goddesses are  
[1:14:31](https://youtu.be/3k6MBedWTww?t=4471) described in terms of birds who go and  
[1:14:33](https://youtu.be/3k6MBedWTww?t=4473) intercede for you  
[1:14:35](https://youtu.be/3k6MBedWTww?t=4475) but Muhammad after introducing Coheed  
[1:14:38](https://youtu.be/3k6MBedWTww?t=4478) says that it's actually chapters of the  
[1:14:41](https://youtu.be/3k6MBedWTww?t=4481) Quran that do that for you now they  
[1:14:43](https://youtu.be/3k6MBedWTww?t=4483) appear as flocks of birds to go up to  
[1:14:46](https://youtu.be/3k6MBedWTww?t=4486) Allah and intercede for you now if I ask  
[1:14:50](https://youtu.be/3k6MBedWTww?t=4490) any Muslim in here hey if someone  
[1:14:52](https://youtu.be/3k6MBedWTww?t=4492) believes that there's God and then there  
[1:14:54](https://youtu.be/3k6MBedWTww?t=4494) are these other beings who intercede and  
[1:14:57](https://youtu.be/3k6MBedWTww?t=4497) fly up to them and  
[1:14:58](https://youtu.be/3k6MBedWTww?t=4498) and intercede for you and plead for you  
[1:15:00](https://youtu.be/3k6MBedWTww?t=4500) is that polytheism monotheism every  
[1:15:02](https://youtu.be/3k6MBedWTww?t=4502) Muslim would say that's polytheism okay  
[1:15:05](https://youtu.be/3k6MBedWTww?t=4505) well if there are these flocks of birds  
[1:15:07](https://youtu.be/3k6MBedWTww?t=4507) around and they are the eternal speech  
[1:15:10](https://youtu.be/3k6MBedWTww?t=4510) of Allah and they fly up and intercede  
[1:15:13](https://youtu.be/3k6MBedWTww?t=4513) for you and they plead on your behalf  
[1:15:15](https://youtu.be/3k6MBedWTww?t=4515) what is that it's pure monotheism that  
[1:15:19](https://youtu.be/3k6MBedWTww?t=4519) is very interesting he says no one  
[1:15:23](https://youtu.be/3k6MBedWTww?t=4523) refers to the Quran as a person or  
[1:15:26](https://youtu.be/3k6MBedWTww?t=4526) chapters the Quran as a person again if  
[1:15:29](https://youtu.be/3k6MBedWTww?t=4529) you understand how we use the term that  
[1:15:31](https://youtu.be/3k6MBedWTww?t=4531) should end the confusion as for the  
[1:15:35](https://youtu.be/3k6MBedWTww?t=4535) Quran having a mother will melt Kitab  
[1:15:38](https://youtu.be/3k6MBedWTww?t=4538) yeah  
[1:15:40](https://youtu.be/3k6MBedWTww?t=4540) you pointed out that well if you're if  
[1:15:42](https://youtu.be/3k6MBedWTww?t=4542) you're saying it's not literally  
[1:15:45](https://youtu.be/3k6MBedWTww?t=4545) biological then you must be saying it's  
[1:15:48](https://youtu.be/3k6MBedWTww?t=4548) merely metaphorical and no not in the  
[1:15:51](https://youtu.be/3k6MBedWTww?t=4551) Jewish or Christian scriptures son of is  
[1:15:55](https://youtu.be/3k6MBedWTww?t=4555) used in a variety of ways and so the  
[1:15:58](https://youtu.be/3k6MBedWTww?t=4558) appropriate minutes left the appropriate  
[1:16:01](https://youtu.be/3k6MBedWTww?t=4561) response to Christian theology would be  
[1:16:04](https://youtu.be/3k6MBedWTww?t=4564) explained to you explain to us what  
[1:16:06](https://youtu.be/3k6MBedWTww?t=4566) Jesus sonship means and that would be  
[1:16:08](https://youtu.be/3k6MBedWTww?t=4568) explained in terms of the doctrine of  
[1:16:11](https://youtu.be/3k6MBedWTww?t=4571) the Trinity but no Christian has ever  
[1:16:13](https://youtu.be/3k6MBedWTww?t=4573) meant that Jesus is the biological son  
[1:16:18](https://youtu.be/3k6MBedWTww?t=4578) of the Father so if Allah is telling  
[1:16:21](https://youtu.be/3k6MBedWTww?t=4581) Muslims in the Quran and I bring this up  
[1:16:23](https://youtu.be/3k6MBedWTww?t=4583) because I hear this from Muslims almost  
[1:16:25](https://youtu.be/3k6MBedWTww?t=4585) every day well how can you believe that  
[1:16:26](https://youtu.be/3k6MBedWTww?t=4586) God had sex with Mary well I never heard  
[1:16:29](https://youtu.be/3k6MBedWTww?t=4589) of a Christian believing that where are  
[1:16:31](https://youtu.be/3k6MBedWTww?t=4591) you getting that idea from getting it  
[1:16:33](https://youtu.be/3k6MBedWTww?t=4593) from the Quran from Allah so the point  
[1:16:35](https://youtu.be/3k6MBedWTww?t=4595) here is if Allah knows what the  
[1:16:39](https://youtu.be/3k6MBedWTww?t=4599) Christian doctrine is why doesn't Allah  
[1:16:42](https://youtu.be/3k6MBedWTww?t=4602) say what the Christian doctrine is and  
[1:16:44](https://youtu.be/3k6MBedWTww?t=4604) then explain why it's wrong he just  
[1:16:47](https://youtu.be/3k6MBedWTww?t=4607) never does Allah tries to refute the  
[1:16:49](https://youtu.be/3k6MBedWTww?t=4609) Trinity doesn't know what the doctor and  
[1:16:51](https://youtu.be/3k6MBedWTww?t=4611) the Trinity is he thinks it's it's Allah  
[1:16:53](https://youtu.be/3k6MBedWTww?t=4613) Jesus and Mary were three separate  
[1:16:55](https://youtu.be/3k6MBedWTww?t=4615) beings who just work together that's not  
[1:16:57](https://youtu.be/3k6MBedWTww?t=4617) the doctrine of the Trinity what's he  
[1:16:59](https://youtu.be/3k6MBedWTww?t=4619) responding to likewise with the sonship  
[1:17:01](https://youtu.be/3k6MBedWTww?t=4621) of Jesus he gets it all wrong so you've  
[1:17:05](https://youtu.be/3k6MBedWTww?t=4625) got a problem here either your God  
[1:17:06](https://youtu.be/3k6MBedWTww?t=4626) doesn't know what we believe in which  
[1:17:09](https://youtu.be/3k6MBedWTww?t=4629) case he lacks knowledge or  
[1:17:11](https://youtu.be/3k6MBedWTww?t=4631) does know what we believe and he's  
[1:17:13](https://youtu.be/3k6MBedWTww?t=4633) deliberately making fun of it or  
[1:17:15](https://youtu.be/3k6MBedWTww?t=4635) misrepresenting it if he's deliberately  
[1:17:18](https://youtu.be/3k6MBedWTww?t=4638) misrepresenting it then that would be an  
[1:17:20](https://youtu.be/3k6MBedWTww?t=4640) ethical problem six I said that a laws  
[1:17:24](https://youtu.be/3k6MBedWTww?t=4644) spirit is an eternal person who takes  
[1:17:27](https://youtu.be/3k6MBedWTww?t=4647) the form of a man to carry out tasks  
[1:17:30](https://youtu.be/3k6MBedWTww?t=4650) again having trouble hearing down there  
[1:17:33](https://youtu.be/3k6MBedWTww?t=4653) if there was a response to that please  
[1:17:34](https://youtu.be/3k6MBedWTww?t=4654) remind me seventh I said that it's LOM  
[1:17:37](https://youtu.be/3k6MBedWTww?t=4657) deifies Mohammed said well you know  
[1:17:40](https://youtu.be/3k6MBedWTww?t=4660) Mohammed spitting and stuff doesn't that  
[1:17:42](https://youtu.be/3k6MBedWTww?t=4662) what's that got to do with him being God  
[1:17:43](https://youtu.be/3k6MBedWTww?t=4663) that's not that's not the point  
[1:17:44](https://youtu.be/3k6MBedWTww?t=4664) the point was Mohammed's just a man the  
[1:17:47](https://youtu.be/3k6MBedWTww?t=4667) Mohammed's just a man Mohammed's just a  
[1:17:48](https://youtu.be/3k6MBedWTww?t=4668) man and then you see how his followers  
[1:17:51](https://youtu.be/3k6MBedWTww?t=4671) acted towards him and it's clear he was  
[1:17:55](https://youtu.be/3k6MBedWTww?t=4675) much more than a man Tim when a normal  
[1:17:57](https://youtu.be/3k6MBedWTww?t=4677) human being is walking down the street  
[1:17:59](https://youtu.be/3k6MBedWTww?t=4679) and spits you don't say oh I have to rub  
[1:18:01](https://youtu.be/3k6MBedWTww?t=4681) this all over my body Muhammad's  
[1:18:02](https://youtu.be/3k6MBedWTww?t=4682) companions did if a hair falls off a  
[1:18:05](https://youtu.be/3k6MBedWTww?t=4685) normal human beings head you don't say  
[1:18:06](https://youtu.be/3k6MBedWTww?t=4686) ooh I need to grab this I need to save  
[1:18:09](https://youtu.be/3k6MBedWTww?t=4689) this if someone is bleeding a normal  
[1:18:12](https://youtu.be/3k6MBedWTww?t=4692) human being is bleeding you don't say  
[1:18:13](https://youtu.be/3k6MBedWTww?t=4693) hey let me get that running blood and  
[1:18:15](https://youtu.be/3k6MBedWTww?t=4695) drink it this was acceptable behavior  
[1:18:19](https://youtu.be/3k6MBedWTww?t=4699) from Muhammad and his followers and how  
[1:18:24](https://youtu.be/3k6MBedWTww?t=4704) if you saw anyone doing this if I said  
[1:18:27](https://youtu.be/3k6MBedWTww?t=4707) hey there's this place somewhere in  
[1:18:29](https://youtu.be/3k6MBedWTww?t=4709) South America or something and they've  
[1:18:31](https://youtu.be/3k6MBedWTww?t=4711) got this guy down there and whenever he  
[1:18:34](https://youtu.be/3k6MBedWTww?t=4714) spits they rub it on their faces  
[1:18:36](https://youtu.be/3k6MBedWTww?t=4716) whenever he washes himself they collect  
[1:18:38](https://youtu.be/3k6MBedWTww?t=4718) the water so they can rub it on  
[1:18:39](https://youtu.be/3k6MBedWTww?t=4719) themselves whenever he bleeds he gets  
[1:18:42](https://youtu.be/3k6MBedWTww?t=4722) cut they drink it you say ah look at  
[1:18:44](https://youtu.be/3k6MBedWTww?t=4724) this idolatry look at this paganism  
[1:18:46](https://youtu.be/3k6MBedWTww?t=4726) that's exactly how Muhammad expected his  
[1:18:49](https://youtu.be/3k6MBedWTww?t=4729) followers to act and for some reason  
[1:18:53](https://youtu.be/3k6MBedWTww?t=4733) whenever it's in Islam it's still just  
[1:18:54](https://youtu.be/3k6MBedWTww?t=4734) pure monotheism I said that Islam  
[1:18:58](https://youtu.be/3k6MBedWTww?t=4738) accidentally deifies Jesus calls Jesus a  
[1:19:03](https://youtu.be/3k6MBedWTww?t=4743) laws word and a spirit from Allah now  
[1:19:07](https://youtu.be/3k6MBedWTww?t=4747) keep in mind those are the two eternal  
[1:19:10](https://youtu.be/3k6MBedWTww?t=4750) co-creating Co eternal beings with Allah  
[1:19:14](https://youtu.be/3k6MBedWTww?t=4754) his word and his spirit now this is  
[1:19:17](https://youtu.be/3k6MBedWTww?t=4757) interesting  
[1:19:19](https://youtu.be/3k6MBedWTww?t=4759) Muhammad said mamita job said that  
[1:19:22](https://youtu.be/3k6MBedWTww?t=4762) the Quran calls Jesus the word because  
[1:19:25](https://youtu.be/3k6MBedWTww?t=4765) Allah said be and he was so Allah said  
[1:19:29](https://youtu.be/3k6MBedWTww?t=4769) be and he was and this makes him a laws  
[1:19:34](https://youtu.be/3k6MBedWTww?t=4774) word now that's very interesting because  
[1:19:35](https://youtu.be/3k6MBedWTww?t=4775) uh according to chapter 16 verse 40 of  
[1:19:38](https://youtu.be/3k6MBedWTww?t=4778) the Quran that's how Allah creates  
[1:19:39](https://youtu.be/3k6MBedWTww?t=4779) everything that's how Allah creates me  
[1:19:43](https://youtu.be/3k6MBedWTww?t=4783) so Allah created me by saying B and  
[1:19:46](https://youtu.be/3k6MBedWTww?t=4786) according to Muhammad hijab that's how  
[1:19:47](https://youtu.be/3k6MBedWTww?t=4787) you can identify someone as the word of  
[1:19:49](https://youtu.be/3k6MBedWTww?t=4789) Allah what's that make me I am the word  
[1:19:53](https://youtu.be/3k6MBedWTww?t=4793) of Allah according to Muhammad hood job  
[1:19:55](https://youtu.be/3k6MBedWTww?t=4795) so if you reject anything I've in it  
[1:19:58](https://youtu.be/3k6MBedWTww?t=4798) left if you reject anything I say for  
[1:20:00](https://youtu.be/3k6MBedWTww?t=4800) the rest of the evening you're guilty of  
[1:20:03](https://youtu.be/3k6MBedWTww?t=4803) rebelling against Allah's word as far as  
[1:20:07](https://youtu.be/3k6MBedWTww?t=4807) Islam drawing its worship from its basic  
[1:20:12](https://youtu.be/3k6MBedWTww?t=4812) practices from the pagans of Mecca it  
[1:20:16](https://youtu.be/3k6MBedWTww?t=4816) really noticed you you can read in the  
[1:20:18](https://youtu.be/3k6MBedWTww?t=4818) Muslim sources that the pagans are  
[1:20:19](https://youtu.be/3k6MBedWTww?t=4819) walking these circles and kissing the  
[1:20:20](https://youtu.be/3k6MBedWTww?t=4820) black stone and so on you can also read  
[1:20:23](https://youtu.be/3k6MBedWTww?t=4823) that they believed in these seven  
[1:20:25](https://youtu.be/3k6MBedWTww?t=4825) planetary deities that are circling the  
[1:20:27](https://youtu.be/3k6MBedWTww?t=4827) earth so you can read all about their  
[1:20:29](https://youtu.be/3k6MBedWTww?t=4829) worship what you have to believe if you  
[1:20:31](https://youtu.be/3k6MBedWTww?t=4831) want to reconcile this with Islam's you  
[1:20:33](https://youtu.be/3k6MBedWTww?t=4833) have to say Abraham set that up walking  
[1:20:35](https://youtu.be/3k6MBedWTww?t=4835) the seven circles and then the pagans  
[1:20:37](https://youtu.be/3k6MBedWTww?t=4837) misinterpreted it at some point and they  
[1:20:39](https://youtu.be/3k6MBedWTww?t=4839) started walking seven circles around the  
[1:20:41](https://youtu.be/3k6MBedWTww?t=4841) Kaaba for a completely different reason  
[1:20:43](https://youtu.be/3k6MBedWTww?t=4843) so you'd have to believe that and then  
[1:20:45](https://youtu.be/3k6MBedWTww?t=4845) as far as the black stone well it was a  
[1:20:47](https://youtu.be/3k6MBedWTww?t=4847) black stone and then it became part of  
[1:20:49](https://youtu.be/3k6MBedWTww?t=4849) their pagan worship and then got brought  
[1:20:51](https://youtu.be/3k6MBedWTww?t=4851) back but keep in mind this in seconds a  
[1:20:53](https://youtu.be/3k6MBedWTww?t=4853) rock that is going to appear with eyes  
[1:20:55](https://youtu.be/3k6MBedWTww?t=4855) and a mouth and you kiss it thank you

[1:21:24](https://youtu.be/3k6MBedWTww?t=4884) sword upper he thinks he says he thinks  
[1:21:26](https://youtu.be/3k6MBedWTww?t=4886) this means that the chapters of the  
[1:21:28](https://youtu.be/3k6MBedWTww?t=4888) Quran are persons I wanted to do this  
[1:21:30](https://youtu.be/3k6MBedWTww?t=4890) yeah to take a word from Dwayne the rock

[1:21:50](https://youtu.be/3k6MBedWTww?t=4910) of the Quran is what is represented the  
[1:21:53](https://youtu.be/3k6MBedWTww?t=4913) web you get the rewards for doing the  
[1:21:56](https://youtu.be/3k6MBedWTww?t=4916) good then it comes that's what the

[1:21:59](https://youtu.be/3k6MBedWTww?t=4919) in a good form this is the hadith in  
[1:22:01](https://youtu.be/3k6MBedWTww?t=4921) Bukhari he says a lateral also matters  
[1:22:05](https://youtu.be/3k6MBedWTww?t=4925) that it's a local commerce Bud's

[1:22:15](https://youtu.be/3k6MBedWTww?t=4935) permission it's one part of a verse  
[1:22:18](https://youtu.be/3k6MBedWTww?t=4938) which refutes all of your claims about  
[1:22:20](https://youtu.be/3k6MBedWTww?t=4940) intercession in fact he says home means  
[1:22:22](https://youtu.be/3k6MBedWTww?t=4942) mother it doesn't all only mean mother

[1:22:49](https://youtu.be/3k6MBedWTww?t=4969) said he actually asked me for something  
[1:22:51](https://youtu.be/3k6MBedWTww?t=4971) linguistic he said what's the linguistic  
[1:22:52](https://youtu.be/3k6MBedWTww?t=4972) basis that the words Salah  
[1:22:54](https://youtu.be/3k6MBedWTww?t=4974) what is it what does it come from  
[1:22:55](https://youtu.be/3k6MBedWTww?t=4975) etymologically the word Salah comes from  
[1:22:57](https://youtu.be/3k6MBedWTww?t=4977) the word Silla Silla means connection so  
[1:23:00](https://youtu.be/3k6MBedWTww?t=4980) it could be any connection it doesn't  
[1:23:01](https://youtu.be/3k6MBedWTww?t=4981) necessarily always have to be prayer and

[1:23:05](https://youtu.be/3k6MBedWTww?t=4985) this is the root word but it comes from  
[1:23:07](https://youtu.be/3k6MBedWTww?t=4987) the etymological root word Silla  
[1:23:08](https://youtu.be/3k6MBedWTww?t=4988) which means connection it could mean any  
[1:23:10](https://youtu.be/3k6MBedWTww?t=4990) connection serum for exam  
[1:23:12](https://youtu.be/3k6MBedWTww?t=4992) connecting with your family members you  
[1:23:14](https://youtu.be/3k6MBedWTww?t=4994) don't know these things he says the  
[1:23:15](https://youtu.be/3k6MBedWTww?t=4995) quran gets the Trinity wrong and he's  
[1:23:17](https://youtu.be/3k6MBedWTww?t=4997) talking about chapter 5 verse 116 of the  
[1:23:19](https://youtu.be/3k6MBedWTww?t=4999) Quran where it talks about did you tell  
[1:23:21](https://youtu.be/3k6MBedWTww?t=5001) your mother that you can take two of us  
[1:23:23](https://youtu.be/3k6MBedWTww?t=5003) as law - beside God it's not talking  
[1:23:25](https://youtu.be/3k6MBedWTww?t=5005) about the Trinity in this verse where  
[1:23:26](https://youtu.be/3k6MBedWTww?t=5006) does it say this is the Trinity and they  
[1:23:28](https://youtu.be/3k6MBedWTww?t=5008) describe it the only the verses that  
[1:23:30](https://youtu.be/3k6MBedWTww?t=5010) describe the Trinity  
[1:23:31](https://youtu.be/3k6MBedWTww?t=5011) for example chapter 4 verse hundred  
[1:23:32](https://youtu.be/3k6MBedWTww?t=5012) seventy one of the Quran other places  
[1:23:33](https://youtu.be/3k6MBedWTww?t=5013) the Quran like chapter five with the  
[1:23:35](https://youtu.be/3k6MBedWTww?t=5015) brother was reading it never tells you  
[1:23:37](https://youtu.be/3k6MBedWTww?t=5017) what the Trinity is which is why for  
[1:23:38](https://youtu.be/3k6MBedWTww?t=5018) example many scholars like him came in  
[1:23:40](https://youtu.be/3k6MBedWTww?t=5020) as a jobber sahi many scholars actually  
[1:23:42](https://youtu.be/3k6MBedWTww?t=5022) did say that the Trinity was Father Son  
[1:23:44](https://youtu.be/3k6MBedWTww?t=5024) the Holy Spirit but some scholars  
[1:23:46](https://youtu.be/3k6MBedWTww?t=5026) differed with them in exegesis it  
[1:23:47](https://youtu.be/3k6MBedWTww?t=5027) doesn't matter the word 3 in Arabic  
[1:23:49](https://youtu.be/3k6MBedWTww?t=5029) fellas that means all of the kinds of  
[1:23:51](https://youtu.be/3k6MBedWTww?t=5031) Trinity's that all of the Christians  
[1:23:52](https://youtu.be/3k6MBedWTww?t=5032) have ever believed in in all of history  
[1:23:53](https://youtu.be/3k6MBedWTww?t=5033) so the west allis and arabic is all  
[1:23:55](https://youtu.be/3k6MBedWTww?t=5035) comprehensive it doesn't say that the  
[1:23:57](https://youtu.be/3k6MBedWTww?t=5037) word Trinity is Mary it doesn't say that  
[1:24:00](https://youtu.be/3k6MBedWTww?t=5040) the Quran you have light against the  
[1:24:01](https://youtu.be/3k6MBedWTww?t=5041) Quran and then he says here the raw the  
[1:24:05](https://youtu.be/3k6MBedWTww?t=5045) Rope of Allah subhana WA Ta'ala this you  
[1:24:08](https://youtu.be/3k6MBedWTww?t=5048) have to understand basic basic rules of

[1:24:27](https://youtu.be/3k6MBedWTww?t=5067) thing that our students learn let's not  
[1:24:29](https://youtu.be/3k6MBedWTww?t=5069) waste my time with this please you've  
[1:24:30](https://youtu.be/3k6MBedWTww?t=5070) come here 20 years of research and this  
[1:24:31](https://youtu.be/3k6MBedWTww?t=5071) what you present don't waste my time  
[1:24:33](https://youtu.be/3k6MBedWTww?t=5073) it says here Islam accidentally deifies  
[1:24:37](https://youtu.be/3k6MBedWTww?t=5077) Jesus because he is Kali Mutulu why does  
[1:24:41](https://youtu.be/3k6MBedWTww?t=5081) the Koran call in the Kalima because  
[1:24:43](https://youtu.be/3k6MBedWTww?t=5083) it's stressing the fact that Allah said  
[1:24:45](https://youtu.be/3k6MBedWTww?t=5085) be and he was  
[1:24:46](https://youtu.be/3k6MBedWTww?t=5086) to make an emphasis a point of emphasis  
[1:24:49](https://youtu.be/3k6MBedWTww?t=5089) for Christians who believe otherwise  
[1:24:51](https://youtu.be/3k6MBedWTww?t=5091) and then the pagans pagan sources he  
[1:24:55](https://youtu.be/3k6MBedWTww?t=5095) didn't give any now realize ladies and  
[1:24:57](https://youtu.be/3k6MBedWTww?t=5097) gentlemen this man put Christianity  
[1:24:59](https://youtu.be/3k6MBedWTww?t=5099) under the bus he threw Christianity  
[1:25:01](https://youtu.be/3k6MBedWTww?t=5101) under the bus today I asked him for  
[1:25:03](https://youtu.be/3k6MBedWTww?t=5103) questions none of those questions were  
[1:25:05](https://youtu.be/3k6MBedWTww?t=5105) answered  
[1:25:07](https://youtu.be/3k6MBedWTww?t=5107) those questions were answered by our  
[1:25:11](https://youtu.be/3k6MBedWTww?t=5111) minutes now is the Trinity in 300 years  
[1:25:15](https://youtu.be/3k6MBedWTww?t=5115) if it is a basic natural inference of  
[1:25:18](https://youtu.be/3k6MBedWTww?t=5118) the Old Testament how could you have  
[1:25:21](https://youtu.be/3k6MBedWTww?t=5121) 4,000 years of Hebrew history no one has  
[1:25:24](https://youtu.be/3k6MBedWTww?t=5124) inferred it if it's a natural reading of  
[1:25:28](https://youtu.be/3k6MBedWTww?t=5128) the New Testament how comes you have 300  
[1:25:31](https://youtu.be/3k6MBedWTww?t=5131) years 300 years and no church father  
[1:25:35](https://youtu.be/3k6MBedWTww?t=5135) believed the Nicene to the terrorism the  
[1:25:37](https://youtu.be/3k6MBedWTww?t=5137) way that you believe today why are you  
[1:25:39](https://youtu.be/3k6MBedWTww?t=5139) back projecting anachronistic Allah  
[1:25:41](https://youtu.be/3k6MBedWTww?t=5141) superimposing this idea that was  
[1:25:45](https://youtu.be/3k6MBedWTww?t=5145) advanced and crystallized by the  
[1:25:47](https://youtu.be/3k6MBedWTww?t=5147) Cappadocia in fathers in 381 and putting  
[1:25:50](https://youtu.be/3k6MBedWTww?t=5150) it and forcing it you're the one force  
[1:25:52](https://youtu.be/3k6MBedWTww?t=5152) again forcing on the New Testament more  
[1:25:54](https://youtu.be/3k6MBedWTww?t=5154) egregiously you're forcing it in the Old  
[1:25:55](https://youtu.be/3k6MBedWTww?t=5155) Testament you have put you have done a  
[1:25:57](https://youtu.be/3k6MBedWTww?t=5157) shameful service today for the  
[1:25:59](https://youtu.be/3k6MBedWTww?t=5159) Christians you have not defended  
[1:26:00](https://youtu.be/3k6MBedWTww?t=5160) Christianity today you should have  
[1:26:02](https://youtu.be/3k6MBedWTww?t=5162) brought James white with you or someone  
[1:26:04](https://youtu.be/3k6MBedWTww?t=5164) like that seriously you should have  
[1:26:06](https://youtu.be/3k6MBedWTww?t=5166) brought someone who could have helped  
[1:26:08](https://youtu.be/3k6MBedWTww?t=5168) you you are saying me and not Nana and  
[1:26:10](https://youtu.be/3k6MBedWTww?t=5170) Ali versus you man you should have  
[1:26:12](https://youtu.be/3k6MBedWTww?t=5172) brought someone with you seriously  
[1:26:13](https://youtu.be/3k6MBedWTww?t=5173) what's going on here 20 years of  
[1:26:16](https://youtu.be/3k6MBedWTww?t=5176) attacking Islam 20 years of attacking  
[1:26:19](https://youtu.be/3k6MBedWTww?t=5179) Islam 99% of your content is anti Islam  
[1:26:22](https://youtu.be/3k6MBedWTww?t=5182) and all of those things you brought  
[1:26:23](https://youtu.be/3k6MBedWTww?t=5183) today were dismissed in four minutes you  
[1:26:30](https://youtu.be/3k6MBedWTww?t=5190) couldn't handle the questioning I gave  
[1:26:33](https://youtu.be/3k6MBedWTww?t=5193) you four I gave you four questions I did  
[1:26:37](https://youtu.be/3k6MBedWTww?t=5197) the servicer of answering all of your  
[1:26:40](https://youtu.be/3k6MBedWTww?t=5200) questions you didn't even answer all of  
[1:26:42](https://youtu.be/3k6MBedWTww?t=5202) mine how dare you  
[1:26:45](https://youtu.be/3k6MBedWTww?t=5205) how dare you

[1:26:51](https://youtu.be/3k6MBedWTww?t=5211) why once again I apologize to all the  
[1:26:54](https://youtu.be/3k6MBedWTww?t=5214) other Christians here why this man is  
[1:26:56](https://youtu.be/3k6MBedWTww?t=5216) made mockumentaries against Islam he's  
[1:26:58](https://youtu.be/3k6MBedWTww?t=5218) attacked Muslims and aggravated Muslims  
[1:27:01](https://youtu.be/3k6MBedWTww?t=5221) we know his story he's not any regular  
[1:27:03](https://youtu.be/3k6MBedWTww?t=5223) Christian ladies and gentlemen the class  
[1:27:04](https://youtu.be/3k6MBedWTww?t=5224) is less aware the Christians are not all  
[1:27:07](https://youtu.be/3k6MBedWTww?t=5227) the same if it was James White I would  
[1:27:09](https://youtu.be/3k6MBedWTww?t=5229) have shown him the utmost respect if it  
[1:27:11](https://youtu.be/3k6MBedWTww?t=5231) was William Lane Craig I would have shot  
[1:27:12](https://youtu.be/3k6MBedWTww?t=5232) him the utmost respect if it was any of  
[1:27:14](https://youtu.be/3k6MBedWTww?t=5234) those guys I would have showed them the  
[1:27:15](https://youtu.be/3k6MBedWTww?t=5235) utmost respect for this man no no no no

[1:27:26](https://youtu.be/3k6MBedWTww?t=5246) okay no problem I've got to one minute  
[1:27:32](https://youtu.be/3k6MBedWTww?t=5252) and a half and I'm pretty much done I  
[1:27:35](https://youtu.be/3k6MBedWTww?t=5255) can't believe it should I give it as a  
[1:27:38](https://youtu.be/3k6MBedWTww?t=5258) charity to him I'll keep it as a charity  
[1:27:41](https://youtu.be/3k6MBedWTww?t=5261) - you have a minute-and-a-half  
[1:27:44](https://youtu.be/3k6MBedWTww?t=5264) charity for muslim - you go ahead  
[1:27:52](https://youtu.be/3k6MBedWTww?t=5272) starting our second rebuttal 8 minutes  
[1:27:54](https://youtu.be/3k6MBedWTww?t=5274) dr. David would you may start that's  
[1:27:56](https://youtu.be/3k6MBedWTww?t=5276) nine and a half he said I got a charity  
[1:28:03](https://youtu.be/3k6MBedWTww?t=5283) thank you thank you I'd say I take all  
[1:28:06](https://youtu.be/3k6MBedWTww?t=5286) the charity alright well I guess we'll  
[1:28:08](https://youtu.be/3k6MBedWTww?t=5288) start off with the four questions I only  
[1:28:10](https://youtu.be/3k6MBedWTww?t=5290) I know we had more rebuttal time and I  
[1:28:12](https://youtu.be/3k6MBedWTww?t=5292) didn't think they were too terribly  
[1:28:13](https://youtu.be/3k6MBedWTww?t=5293) difficult to answer so let's go through  
[1:28:15](https://youtu.be/3k6MBedWTww?t=5295) them question number one why isn't the  
[1:28:20](https://youtu.be/3k6MBedWTww?t=5300) Trinity mentioned in the Old Testament  
[1:28:23](https://youtu.be/3k6MBedWTww?t=5303) well I pointed out multiple passages  
[1:28:26](https://youtu.be/3k6MBedWTww?t=5306) multiple passages where you find a  
[1:28:29](https://youtu.be/3k6MBedWTww?t=5309) plurality and the question is why you  
[1:28:30](https://youtu.be/3k6MBedWTww?t=5310) have this plurality if it's just this  
[1:28:35](https://youtu.be/3k6MBedWTww?t=5315) pure monotheism that Muslims believe in  
[1:28:37](https://youtu.be/3k6MBedWTww?t=5317) i quoted isaiah chapter 48 verse 16  
[1:28:40](https://youtu.be/3k6MBedWTww?t=5320) where yahweh is speaking and yahweh says  
[1:28:43](https://youtu.be/3k6MBedWTww?t=5323) that he has been sent by yahweh along  
[1:28:45](https://youtu.be/3k6MBedWTww?t=5325) with the spirit of yahweh how do you  
[1:28:48](https://youtu.be/3k6MBedWTww?t=5328) make sense of that note to be clear that  
[1:28:50](https://youtu.be/3k6MBedWTww?t=5330) is not that is not a clear statement of  
[1:28:57](https://youtu.be/3k6MBedWTww?t=5337) the doctrine of the Trinity but to say  
[1:28:59](https://youtu.be/3k6MBedWTww?t=5339) that these passages refute the doctrine  
[1:29:01](https://youtu.be/3k6MBedWTww?t=5341) of the Trinity that the Old Testament  
[1:29:02](https://youtu.be/3k6MBedWTww?t=5342) refutes the doctrine of the Trinity wait  
[1:29:04](https://youtu.be/3k6MBedWTww?t=5344) a minute we'll keep this time  
[1:29:19](https://youtu.be/3k6MBedWTww?t=5359) even the go-to verse you have lots of  
[1:29:22](https://youtu.be/3k6MBedWTww?t=5362) verses that sound like plurality you  
[1:29:24](https://youtu.be/3k6MBedWTww?t=5364) have to interpret those away if you  
[1:29:25](https://youtu.be/3k6MBedWTww?t=5365) don't want to believe that the Old  
[1:29:27](https://youtu.be/3k6MBedWTww?t=5367) Testament is actually calling for saying  
[1:29:29](https://youtu.be/3k6MBedWTww?t=5369) that God is plural in some sense but  
[1:29:32](https://youtu.be/3k6MBedWTww?t=5372) even the go-to passage the Shema which  
[1:29:37](https://youtu.be/3k6MBedWTww?t=5377) he said it in in the Old Testament and  
[1:29:40](https://youtu.be/3k6MBedWTww?t=5380) the New Testament that's the go-to verse  
[1:29:42](https://youtu.be/3k6MBedWTww?t=5382) that's the go-to verse that proves this  
[1:29:48](https://youtu.be/3k6MBedWTww?t=5388) pure monotheism you know what the  
[1:29:51](https://youtu.be/3k6MBedWTww?t=5391) neshamah  
[1:29:52](https://youtu.be/3k6MBedWTww?t=5392) actually says shema yisrael Yahweh  
[1:29:57](https://youtu.be/3k6MBedWTww?t=5397) Elohim Yahweh Akkad now we insert extra  
[1:30:01](https://youtu.be/3k6MBedWTww?t=5401) words in there to make that a complete  
[1:30:03](https://youtu.be/3k6MBedWTww?t=5403) sentence what that actually says hear o  
[1:30:06](https://youtu.be/3k6MBedWTww?t=5406) Israel Yahweh his name of God hello hey  
[1:30:10](https://youtu.be/3k6MBedWTww?t=5410) new means our God Yahweh means our  
[1:30:14](https://youtu.be/3k6MBedWTww?t=5414) that's God one that's what it says here  
[1:30:19](https://youtu.be/3k6MBedWTww?t=5419) Oh Israel Yahweh Elohim Yahweh one  
[1:30:23](https://youtu.be/3k6MBedWTww?t=5423) that's what it says  
[1:30:25](https://youtu.be/3k6MBedWTww?t=5425) names God three times and then says one  
[1:30:29](https://youtu.be/3k6MBedWTww?t=5429) now this is a Jewish commentary on the  
[1:30:34](https://youtu.be/3k6MBedWTww?t=5434) Torah wanted to quote this because  
[1:30:38](https://youtu.be/3k6MBedWTww?t=5438) there's a commentary on the Shema itself  
[1:30:41](https://youtu.be/3k6MBedWTww?t=5441) the comment saying they say hear o  
[1:30:43](https://youtu.be/3k6MBedWTww?t=5443) Israel Yahweh Elohim Yahweh is one these  
[1:30:48](https://youtu.be/3k6MBedWTww?t=5448) three are one  
[1:30:49](https://youtu.be/3k6MBedWTww?t=5449) how can the three names be one only  
[1:30:53](https://youtu.be/3k6MBedWTww?t=5453) through the perception of faith and the  
[1:30:57](https://youtu.be/3k6MBedWTww?t=5457) vision of the Holy Spirit and the  
[1:30:58](https://youtu.be/3k6MBedWTww?t=5458) beholding of the hidden eyes alone now  
[1:31:02](https://youtu.be/3k6MBedWTww?t=5462) that beef by the way these are  
[1:31:04](https://youtu.be/3k6MBedWTww?t=5464) Unitarians here but the fact that  
[1:31:07](https://youtu.be/3k6MBedWTww?t=5467) they're discussing a kind of try unity  
[1:31:10](https://youtu.be/3k6MBedWTww?t=5470) in the go-to passage for Muslims around  
[1:31:14](https://youtu.be/3k6MBedWTww?t=5474) the world to say this refutes the  
[1:31:16](https://youtu.be/3k6MBedWTww?t=5476) doctrine of the Trinity and they're  
[1:31:18](https://youtu.be/3k6MBedWTww?t=5478) describing it in Trinitarian terms again  
[1:31:24](https://youtu.be/3k6MBedWTww?t=5484) not the Christian Trinity but try unity  
[1:31:26](https://youtu.be/3k6MBedWTww?t=5486) of the names there if that's your best  
[1:31:28](https://youtu.be/3k6MBedWTww?t=5488) you're going to need something better  
[1:31:31](https://youtu.be/3k6MBedWTww?t=5491) so you find plurality throughout the Old  
[1:31:34](https://youtu.be/3k6MBedWTww?t=5494) Testament in various passages why  
[1:31:36](https://youtu.be/3k6MBedWTww?t=5496) doesn't the why doesn't God specifically  
[1:31:38](https://youtu.be/3k6MBedWTww?t=5498) say Trinity well I think it's very  
[1:31:41](https://youtu.be/3k6MBedWTww?t=5501) similar to what you find when Moses  
[1:31:44](https://youtu.be/3k6MBedWTww?t=5504) comes along and God says to him Abraham  
[1:31:48](https://youtu.be/3k6MBedWTww?t=5508) Isaac and Jacob knew me but they did not  
[1:31:51](https://youtu.be/3k6MBedWTww?t=5511) know me as Yahweh now this isn't just  
[1:31:55](https://youtu.be/3k6MBedWTww?t=5515) talking about the name is talking about  
[1:31:56](https://youtu.be/3k6MBedWTww?t=5516) God's character so think about this God  
[1:32:00](https://youtu.be/3k6MBedWTww?t=5520) is bringing a covenant God is bringing a  
[1:32:02](https://youtu.be/3k6MBedWTww?t=5522) covenants to the children of Israel with  
[1:32:05](https://youtu.be/3k6MBedWTww?t=5525) Moses and then he says I'm revealing  
[1:32:08](https://youtu.be/3k6MBedWTww?t=5528) more about myself than I did to Abraham  
[1:32:11](https://youtu.be/3k6MBedWTww?t=5531) Isaac and Jacob now think about this  
[1:32:13](https://youtu.be/3k6MBedWTww?t=5533) according to Mohamed ajob we'd have to  
[1:32:15](https://youtu.be/3k6MBedWTww?t=5535) say oh well why didn't they know this  
[1:32:16](https://youtu.be/3k6MBedWTww?t=5536) earlier stuff then why didn't they have  
[1:32:18](https://youtu.be/3k6MBedWTww?t=5538) the same knowledge well  
[1:32:20](https://youtu.be/3k6MBedWTww?t=5540) Christians and Muslims believe in  
[1:32:22](https://youtu.be/3k6MBedWTww?t=5542) progressive revelation God can give more  
[1:32:24](https://youtu.be/3k6MBedWTww?t=5544) now think about what God did there he's  
[1:32:26](https://youtu.be/3k6MBedWTww?t=5546) giving a covenant a new covenant fact  
[1:32:28](https://youtu.be/3k6MBedWTww?t=5548) that we called the Old Covenant now but  
[1:32:30](https://youtu.be/3k6MBedWTww?t=5550) back then it was a new covenant he's  
[1:32:31](https://youtu.be/3k6MBedWTww?t=5551) giving a new covenant and he says giving  
[1:32:36](https://youtu.be/3k6MBedWTww?t=5556) you a new covenant and I'm going to  
[1:32:38](https://youtu.be/3k6MBedWTww?t=5558) reveal more about myself to you so  
[1:32:42](https://youtu.be/3k6MBedWTww?t=5562) according to the Old Testament what does  
[1:32:44](https://youtu.be/3k6MBedWTww?t=5564) God do when he brings a new covenant  
[1:32:45](https://youtu.be/3k6MBedWTww?t=5565) well the pattern is he gives them a  
[1:32:48](https://youtu.be/3k6MBedWTww?t=5568) deeper understanding of who he is so why  
[1:32:53](https://youtu.be/3k6MBedWTww?t=5573) doesn't the Trinity just clearly define  
[1:32:55](https://youtu.be/3k6MBedWTww?t=5575) I mean why doesn't the Old Testament  
[1:32:56](https://youtu.be/3k6MBedWTww?t=5576) clearly define the doctrine of the  
[1:32:57](https://youtu.be/3k6MBedWTww?t=5577) Trinity well in the Old Testament as  
[1:33:00](https://youtu.be/3k6MBedWTww?t=5580) well Jeremiah chapter 31 a new covenant  
[1:33:02](https://youtu.be/3k6MBedWTww?t=5582) is coming  
[1:33:03](https://youtu.be/3k6MBedWTww?t=5583) it's prophesied in the future the big  
[1:33:06](https://youtu.be/3k6MBedWTww?t=5586) one is coming the big Covenant is coming  
[1:33:09](https://youtu.be/3k6MBedWTww?t=5589) well don't you think God's got some more  
[1:33:11](https://youtu.be/3k6MBedWTww?t=5591) information in store for the people of  
[1:33:13](https://youtu.be/3k6MBedWTww?t=5593) the new covenant when this new covenant  
[1:33:15](https://youtu.be/3k6MBedWTww?t=5595) comes I do and who brings the new  
[1:33:19](https://youtu.be/3k6MBedWTww?t=5599) covenant well Jesus it's Jesus entering  
[1:33:23](https://youtu.be/3k6MBedWTww?t=5603) the world and then the Holy Spirit being  
[1:33:26](https://youtu.be/3k6MBedWTww?t=5606) poured out where we find out about the  
[1:33:29](https://youtu.be/3k6MBedWTww?t=5609) inner life of God and this is correlated  
[1:33:32](https://youtu.be/3k6MBedWTww?t=5612) with God's plan of salvation four  
[1:33:35](https://youtu.be/3k6MBedWTww?t=5615) minutes left so why isn't it clearly  
[1:33:38](https://youtu.be/3k6MBedWTww?t=5618) mentioned well that's how God works the  
[1:33:41](https://youtu.be/3k6MBedWTww?t=5621) progressive revelation he does this  
[1:33:43](https://youtu.be/3k6MBedWTww?t=5623) throughout the Bible he keeps giving  
[1:33:44](https://youtu.be/3k6MBedWTww?t=5624) them more  
[1:33:45](https://youtu.be/3k6MBedWTww?t=5625) information especially when he's giving  
[1:33:47](https://youtu.be/3k6MBedWTww?t=5627) a new covenant Mohammed ajob says white  
[1:33:50](https://youtu.be/3k6MBedWTww?t=5630) in the church fathers from the second  
[1:33:53](https://youtu.be/3k6MBedWTww?t=5633) third century and so on  
[1:33:55](https://youtu.be/3k6MBedWTww?t=5635) give fourth century descriptions of the  
[1:33:57](https://youtu.be/3k6MBedWTww?t=5637) doctrine of the Trinity nothing about  
[1:33:59](https://youtu.be/3k6MBedWTww?t=5639) this in the first century the books of  
[1:34:02](https://youtu.be/3k6MBedWTww?t=5642) the Bible are passed out and they're  
[1:34:04](https://youtu.be/3k6MBedWTww?t=5644) they're sort of individual books there's  
[1:34:07](https://youtu.be/3k6MBedWTww?t=5647) not a collection yet so in the first  
[1:34:11](https://youtu.be/3k6MBedWTww?t=5651) century you've still got books  
[1:34:13](https://youtu.be/3k6MBedWTww?t=5653) circulating as individual books by the  
[1:34:14](https://youtu.be/3k6MBedWTww?t=5654) second century they start getting  
[1:34:16](https://youtu.be/3k6MBedWTww?t=5656) collected let's think about how  
[1:34:17](https://youtu.be/3k6MBedWTww?t=5657) Christians are there there you've got  
[1:34:19](https://youtu.be/3k6MBedWTww?t=5659) farmers you've got fishermen and so on  
[1:34:20](https://youtu.be/3k6MBedWTww?t=5660) you don't have this early on this  
[1:34:24](https://youtu.be/3k6MBedWTww?t=5664) professional class of theologians that  
[1:34:26](https://youtu.be/3k6MBedWTww?t=5666) builds up over time and for the first  
[1:34:30](https://youtu.be/3k6MBedWTww?t=5670) three centuries Christians are and  
[1:34:32](https://youtu.be/3k6MBedWTww?t=5672) Christianity is an illegal religion and  
[1:34:35](https://youtu.be/3k6MBedWTww?t=5675) persecuted they can't get together for  
[1:34:36](https://youtu.be/3k6MBedWTww?t=5676) big conferences to do stuff and to and  
[1:34:40](https://youtu.be/3k6MBedWTww?t=5680) have and to have discussions like this  
[1:34:42](https://youtu.be/3k6MBedWTww?t=5682) the first time they're able to get  
[1:34:45](https://youtu.be/3k6MBedWTww?t=5685) together and have these big these big  
[1:34:47](https://youtu.be/3k6MBedWTww?t=5687) councils is in the fourth century and  
[1:34:49](https://youtu.be/3k6MBedWTww?t=5689) that's what they do and it gets ironed  
[1:34:51](https://youtu.be/3k6MBedWTww?t=5691) out very quickly so the problem as far  
[1:34:54](https://youtu.be/3k6MBedWTww?t=5694) as what's revealed to the Christians  
[1:34:57](https://youtu.be/3k6MBedWTww?t=5697) they have revelations about the father  
[1:34:59](https://youtu.be/3k6MBedWTww?t=5699) about the son about the spirit these  
[1:35:02](https://youtu.be/3k6MBedWTww?t=5702) things are given to them one they need  
[1:35:06](https://youtu.be/3k6MBedWTww?t=5706) the tools of exegesis for saying this is  
[1:35:10](https://youtu.be/3k6MBedWTww?t=5710) what the Holy Spirit did this is what  
[1:35:12](https://youtu.be/3k6MBedWTww?t=5712) Jesus did how do we understand the  
[1:35:14](https://youtu.be/3k6MBedWTww?t=5714) eternal nature of God based on this well  
[1:35:17](https://youtu.be/3k6MBedWTww?t=5717) that's kind of difficult work to do  
[1:35:19](https://youtu.be/3k6MBedWTww?t=5719) ladies and gentlemen it's kind of  
[1:35:21](https://youtu.be/3k6MBedWTww?t=5721) difficult work to do so that sort of  
[1:35:24](https://youtu.be/3k6MBedWTww?t=5724) thing takes a while and they don't have  
[1:35:26](https://youtu.be/3k6MBedWTww?t=5726) the terminology how are you describing  
[1:35:27](https://youtu.be/3k6MBedWTww?t=5727) God being one in essence or nature and  
[1:35:30](https://youtu.be/3k6MBedWTww?t=5730) three in person they don't have a  
[1:35:32](https://youtu.be/3k6MBedWTww?t=5732) there's no language to apply to the  
[1:35:34](https://youtu.be/3k6MBedWTww?t=5734) eternal God they eventually settle on  
[1:35:36](https://youtu.be/3k6MBedWTww?t=5736) some but that takes time but throughout  
[1:35:39](https://youtu.be/3k6MBedWTww?t=5739) this father is God Holy Spirit is God  
[1:35:42](https://youtu.be/3k6MBedWTww?t=5742) son is God this is revealed in Scripture  
[1:35:44](https://youtu.be/3k6MBedWTww?t=5744) if every church father in the history of  
[1:35:47](https://youtu.be/3k6MBedWTww?t=5747) the world had gotten it wrong that  
[1:35:48](https://youtu.be/3k6MBedWTww?t=5748) wouldn't change what the Bible teaches  
[1:35:49](https://youtu.be/3k6MBedWTww?t=5749) and by the way just imagine if if we're  
[1:35:53](https://youtu.be/3k6MBedWTww?t=5753) going to be discussing the nature of the  
[1:35:55](https://youtu.be/3k6MBedWTww?t=5755) Quran or something like this and I start  
[1:35:56](https://youtu.be/3k6MBedWTww?t=5756) oh you know we got Sunnis and Shias  
[1:35:58](https://youtu.be/3k6MBedWTww?t=5758) and these earlier heretical groups and  
[1:36:01](https://youtu.be/3k6MBedWTww?t=5761) everyone's getting stuff wrong and so on  
[1:36:02](https://youtu.be/3k6MBedWTww?t=5762) well it's LOM should be defined by the  
[1:36:05](https://youtu.be/3k6MBedWTww?t=5765) Islamic sources and the teachings that  
[1:36:07](https://youtu.be/3k6MBedWTww?t=5767) you could draw from them just like  
[1:36:08](https://youtu.be/3k6MBedWTww?t=5768) Christianity should be defined by  
[1:36:10](https://youtu.be/3k6MBedWTww?t=5770) Christian sources question three was who  
[1:36:13](https://youtu.be/3k6MBedWTww?t=5773) says that the Holy Spirit is co-equal  
[1:36:15](https://youtu.be/3k6MBedWTww?t=5775) and coeternal which part of he's God  
[1:36:20](https://youtu.be/3k6MBedWTww?t=5780) don't you understand right if the Holy  
[1:36:24](https://youtu.be/3k6MBedWTww?t=5784) Spirit is God we see how where do you  
[1:36:27](https://youtu.be/3k6MBedWTww?t=5787) say co-equal and coeternal with the  
[1:36:30](https://youtu.be/3k6MBedWTww?t=5790) father like later creeds say where does  
[1:36:32](https://youtu.be/3k6MBedWTww?t=5792) it say where did they say that earlier  
[1:36:34](https://youtu.be/3k6MBedWTww?t=5794) one minute left  
[1:36:36](https://youtu.be/3k6MBedWTww?t=5796) he's God if I say the Holy Spirit has  
[1:36:42](https://youtu.be/3k6MBedWTww?t=5802) the attributes of God  
[1:36:43](https://youtu.be/3k6MBedWTww?t=5803) you can ask well what about all these  
[1:36:46](https://youtu.be/3k6MBedWTww?t=5806) later distinctions it became very  
[1:36:48](https://youtu.be/3k6MBedWTww?t=5808) important to them later on when they're  
[1:36:49](https://youtu.be/3k6MBedWTww?t=5809) dealing with various kinds of heresies  
[1:36:50](https://youtu.be/3k6MBedWTww?t=5810) they come up with the terms to respond  
[1:36:52](https://youtu.be/3k6MBedWTww?t=5812) to the heresy but all of these are based  
[1:36:54](https://youtu.be/3k6MBedWTww?t=5814) on going back to the scriptures and  
[1:36:56](https://youtu.be/3k6MBedWTww?t=5816) seeing what lines up with them and  
[1:37:00](https://youtu.be/3k6MBedWTww?t=5820) finally how can we reconcile the  
[1:37:01](https://youtu.be/3k6MBedWTww?t=5821) contradiction of the Trinity I don't  
[1:37:03](https://youtu.be/3k6MBedWTww?t=5823) know what you mean by contradiction  
[1:37:04](https://youtu.be/3k6MBedWTww?t=5824) contradiction is saying that a statement  
[1:37:07](https://youtu.be/3k6MBedWTww?t=5827) is both true and false at the same time  
[1:37:09](https://youtu.be/3k6MBedWTww?t=5829) in the same sense no Christian says that  
[1:37:12](https://youtu.be/3k6MBedWTww?t=5832) God is one and three in the same sense  
[1:37:14](https://youtu.be/3k6MBedWTww?t=5834) never met a Christian who said that say  
[1:37:17](https://youtu.be/3k6MBedWTww?t=5837) that God is one in essence or being or  
[1:37:20](https://youtu.be/3k6MBedWTww?t=5840) nature and three in person if you say  
[1:37:23](https://youtu.be/3k6MBedWTww?t=5843) that's false well I mean think even  
[1:37:24](https://youtu.be/3k6MBedWTww?t=5844) Islam believes that God is one in one  
[1:37:26](https://youtu.be/3k6MBedWTww?t=5846) more than one in another way God is one  
[1:37:28](https://youtu.be/3k6MBedWTww?t=5848) on the level of being more than one on  
[1:37:30](https://youtu.be/3k6MBedWTww?t=5850) the level of attribute has mercy tramps  
[1:37:32](https://youtu.be/3k6MBedWTww?t=5852) over his wrath you don't say that's  
[1:37:33](https://youtu.be/3k6MBedWTww?t=5853) another God why because that's the level  
[1:37:34](https://youtu.be/3k6MBedWTww?t=5854) of attribute we have the level of person  
[1:37:36](https://youtu.be/3k6MBedWTww?t=5856) Doctorow do time's up  
[1:37:39](https://youtu.be/3k6MBedWTww?t=5859) [Music]  
[1:37:42](https://youtu.be/3k6MBedWTww?t=5862) good  
[1:37:43](https://youtu.be/3k6MBedWTww?t=5863) that's it +5 mister her job yep  
[1:37:49](https://youtu.be/3k6MBedWTww?t=5869) if you want to stay seated for the  
[1:37:50](https://youtu.be/3k6MBedWTww?t=5870) crossfire that's always in Oh  
[1:37:52](https://youtu.be/3k6MBedWTww?t=5872) conclusions no conclusions we're  
[1:37:54](https://youtu.be/3k6MBedWTww?t=5874) actually about to do the crossfire okay  
[1:37:56](https://youtu.be/3k6MBedWTww?t=5876) questions with so you can go ahead and  
[1:38:01](https://youtu.be/3k6MBedWTww?t=5881) ask the first question to dr. David Wood  
[1:38:03](https://youtu.be/3k6MBedWTww?t=5883) and he will have two minutes to respond  
[1:38:06](https://youtu.be/3k6MBedWTww?t=5886) well let's just start with the questions  
[1:38:08](https://youtu.be/3k6MBedWTww?t=5888) you didn't answer which church father  
[1:38:11](https://youtu.be/3k6MBedWTww?t=5891) for the first 300 years explicitly  
[1:38:14](https://youtu.be/3k6MBedWTww?t=5894) mentioned that the Holy Spirit is  
[1:38:17](https://youtu.be/3k6MBedWTww?t=5897) co-equal Co eternal with God again from  
[1:38:24](https://youtu.be/3k6MBedWTww?t=5904) the Bible on the Holy Spirit is God now  
[1:38:29](https://youtu.be/3k6MBedWTww?t=5909) here's what I don't understand if you  
[1:38:30](https://youtu.be/3k6MBedWTww?t=5910) take someone like Tertullian or  
[1:38:31](https://youtu.be/3k6MBedWTww?t=5911) something like this and say who calls  
[1:38:33](https://youtu.be/3k6MBedWTww?t=5913) the Holy Spirit God and the question  
[1:38:35](https://youtu.be/3k6MBedWTww?t=5915) then becomes well when did he say he's  
[1:38:38](https://youtu.be/3k6MBedWTww?t=5918) co-equal or Co he turned what do you  
[1:38:40](https://youtu.be/3k6MBedWTww?t=5920) think God what do you think these guys  
[1:38:42](https://youtu.be/3k6MBedWTww?t=5922) mean when they say the Holy Spirit is  
[1:38:44](https://youtu.be/3k6MBedWTww?t=5924) God what do you think the Bible means  
[1:38:46](https://youtu.be/3k6MBedWTww?t=5926) the Bible calls him eternal what do you  
[1:38:49](https://youtu.be/3k6MBedWTww?t=5929) mean koete urn Allah if he's eternal  
[1:38:51](https://youtu.be/3k6MBedWTww?t=5931) then he's obviously Co eternal with the  
[1:38:53](https://youtu.be/3k6MBedWTww?t=5933) father so I'm not under it's like it's  
[1:38:57](https://youtu.be/3k6MBedWTww?t=5937) like saying if I tell you I am the  
[1:38:59](https://youtu.be/3k6MBedWTww?t=5939) current president of the United States  
[1:39:00](https://youtu.be/3k6MBedWTww?t=5940) and you say aha but where where are you  
[1:39:03](https://youtu.be/3k6MBedWTww?t=5943) claiming to be Donald Trump well if I  
[1:39:05](https://youtu.be/3k6MBedWTww?t=5945) claim to be the current president of the  
[1:39:07](https://youtu.be/3k6MBedWTww?t=5947) United States I would be claiming to be  
[1:39:08](https://youtu.be/3k6MBedWTww?t=5948) Donald Trump right I don't have to say  
[1:39:10](https://youtu.be/3k6MBedWTww?t=5950) that other thing right so if you say so  
[1:39:13](https://youtu.be/3k6MBedWTww?t=5953) and so is God or so-and-so has the  
[1:39:15](https://youtu.be/3k6MBedWTww?t=5955) attributes of God it just doesn't make  
[1:39:19](https://youtu.be/3k6MBedWTww?t=5959) it just doesn't make sense to say well  
[1:39:20](https://youtu.be/3k6MBedWTww?t=5960) where is he  
[1:39:20](https://youtu.be/3k6MBedWTww?t=5960) co-equal with the Father echo this these  
[1:39:23](https://youtu.be/3k6MBedWTww?t=5963) are one minute these are terms these are  
[1:39:25](https://youtu.be/3k6MBedWTww?t=5965) terms this is language that was used in  
[1:39:29](https://youtu.be/3k6MBedWTww?t=5969) later councils to clarify right to  
[1:39:35](https://youtu.be/3k6MBedWTww?t=5975) clarify I mean I got turn right around  
[1:39:36](https://youtu.be/3k6MBedWTww?t=5976) say where does the Quran say that the  
[1:39:39](https://youtu.be/3k6MBedWTww?t=5979) Quran is eternal well that's a  
[1:39:41](https://youtu.be/3k6MBedWTww?t=5981) conclusion you draw right that's a  
[1:39:43](https://youtu.be/3k6MBedWTww?t=5983) conclusion you draw from various things  
[1:39:45](https://youtu.be/3k6MBedWTww?t=5985) that the Quran says it doesn't say that  
[1:39:46](https://youtu.be/3k6MBedWTww?t=5986) right you have to interpret it that way  
[1:39:48](https://youtu.be/3k6MBedWTww?t=5988) I don't understand why you can say okay  
[1:39:51](https://youtu.be/3k6MBedWTww?t=5991) well the Bible says that the father is  
[1:39:53](https://youtu.be/3k6MBedWTww?t=5993) God the Holy Spirit is God the Son is  
[1:39:55](https://youtu.be/3k6MBedWTww?t=5995) God  
[1:39:56](https://youtu.be/3k6MBedWTww?t=5996) and therefore as far as the essent as  
[1:39:58](https://youtu.be/3k6MBedWTww?t=5998) far as their essence they're all god  
[1:40:00](https://youtu.be/3k6MBedWTww?t=6000) they're all Yahweh and therefore in that  
[1:40:02](https://youtu.be/3k6MBedWTww?t=6002) sense they are co-equal so what you have  
[1:40:06](https://youtu.be/3k6MBedWTww?t=6006) is later church father saying ok if they  
[1:40:08](https://youtu.be/3k6MBedWTww?t=6008) all share the same essence then in that  
[1:40:09](https://youtu.be/3k6MBedWTww?t=6009) sense they're co-equal why would they  
[1:40:12](https://youtu.be/3k6MBedWTww?t=6012) why would you expect someone in the  
[1:40:13](https://youtu.be/3k6MBedWTww?t=6013) first century to use a word that came  
[1:40:16](https://youtu.be/3k6MBedWTww?t=6016) about to clarify something in the fourth  
[1:40:18](https://youtu.be/3k6MBedWTww?t=6018) century I don't know  
[1:40:19](https://youtu.be/3k6MBedWTww?t=6019) thank you very much dr. bud you may ask  
[1:40:25](https://youtu.be/3k6MBedWTww?t=6025) your first question in towards mr. Raja  
[1:40:28](https://youtu.be/3k6MBedWTww?t=6028) yes  
[1:40:30](https://youtu.be/3k6MBedWTww?t=6030) going back to Allah pray because I'm not  
[1:40:33](https://youtu.be/3k6MBedWTww?t=6033) just trying to mess with you guys here  
[1:40:34](https://youtu.be/3k6MBedWTww?t=6034) really I'm really confused right because  
[1:40:38](https://youtu.be/3k6MBedWTww?t=6038) as I pointed out you have Muslim  
[1:40:40](https://youtu.be/3k6MBedWTww?t=6040) translators translating passages in the  
[1:40:42](https://youtu.be/3k6MBedWTww?t=6042) hadith saying that Allah and His  
[1:40:45](https://youtu.be/3k6MBedWTww?t=6045) creation prays and you look at the Quran  
[1:40:48](https://youtu.be/3k6MBedWTww?t=6048) and it's using similar word but this is  
[1:40:50](https://youtu.be/3k6MBedWTww?t=6050) different this is the Quran and you know  
[1:40:52](https://youtu.be/3k6MBedWTww?t=6052) it's multiple passages and then we'll  
[1:40:54](https://youtu.be/3k6MBedWTww?t=6054) some translators are translating it as  
[1:40:56](https://youtu.be/3k6MBedWTww?t=6056) praise and then you have I think it's  
[1:40:58](https://youtu.be/3k6MBedWTww?t=6058) turma D which which use it and it won't  
[1:40:59](https://youtu.be/3k6MBedWTww?t=6059) translate as anything it just says a lot  
[1:41:01](https://youtu.be/3k6MBedWTww?t=6061) of performances a lot right they won't  
[1:41:03](https://youtu.be/3k6MBedWTww?t=6063) say what it means because if you say it  
[1:41:05](https://youtu.be/3k6MBedWTww?t=6065) means praise then you're going to be  
[1:41:06](https://youtu.be/3k6MBedWTww?t=6066) confused and if you translated it  
[1:41:08](https://youtu.be/3k6MBedWTww?t=6068) something else well if you're then  
[1:41:11](https://youtu.be/3k6MBedWTww?t=6071) you're gonna have to nail down a  
[1:41:12](https://youtu.be/3k6MBedWTww?t=6072) definition of the word so what should  
[1:41:14](https://youtu.be/3k6MBedWTww?t=6074) this word mean what should this in the  
[1:41:17](https://youtu.be/3k6MBedWTww?t=6077) in the Quran and the hadith how should  
[1:41:19](https://youtu.be/3k6MBedWTww?t=6079) this be translated and why are even  
[1:41:24](https://youtu.be/3k6MBedWTww?t=6084) Muslim translators now translating as  
[1:41:26](https://youtu.be/3k6MBedWTww?t=6086) praise if there's this clear other  
[1:41:28](https://youtu.be/3k6MBedWTww?t=6088) meaning I have two minutes I don't think  
[1:41:31](https://youtu.be/3k6MBedWTww?t=6091) I need two minutes to be honest with you  
[1:41:33](https://youtu.be/3k6MBedWTww?t=6093) I think I've dealt with that extensively  
[1:41:34](https://youtu.be/3k6MBedWTww?t=6094) the well Salah solidly Allah is  
[1:41:37](https://youtu.be/3k6MBedWTww?t=6097) different from so Leela and this these  
[1:41:39](https://youtu.be/3k6MBedWTww?t=6099) are basically these are certain  
[1:41:42](https://youtu.be/3k6MBedWTww?t=6102) propositional words that come after the  
[1:41:46](https://youtu.be/3k6MBedWTww?t=6106) verb and depending on which of those  
[1:41:49](https://youtu.be/3k6MBedWTww?t=6109) words come it differentiates the meaning  
[1:41:51](https://youtu.be/3k6MBedWTww?t=6111) completely so because it says Allah  
[1:41:53](https://youtu.be/3k6MBedWTww?t=6113) Allah and you'll never find anyone the  
[1:41:54](https://youtu.be/3k6MBedWTww?t=6114) Quran verse says leave for example after  
[1:41:57](https://youtu.be/3k6MBedWTww?t=6117) the Asolo respects of Sarah province  
[1:41:59](https://youtu.be/3k6MBedWTww?t=6119) Rosalind linguists and Muslims clearly  
[1:42:03](https://youtu.be/3k6MBedWTww?t=6123) concludes that  
[1:42:05](https://youtu.be/3k6MBedWTww?t=6125) it means blessings etc now obviously  
[1:42:08](https://youtu.be/3k6MBedWTww?t=6128) just looking at the Quran on a cursory  
[1:42:11](https://youtu.be/3k6MBedWTww?t=6131) level if you read it in English  
[1:42:13](https://youtu.be/3k6MBedWTww?t=6133) translations of the meanings you'll find  
[1:42:15](https://youtu.be/3k6MBedWTww?t=6135) that there are certain verses before I'm  
[1:42:16](https://youtu.be/3k6MBedWTww?t=6136) if you are just if you respect your  
[1:42:18](https://youtu.be/3k6MBedWTww?t=6138) intellect you will see that it does not  
[1:42:22](https://youtu.be/3k6MBedWTww?t=6142) tell you to pray to Prophet Muhammad  
[1:42:23](https://youtu.be/3k6MBedWTww?t=6143) does not because it tells you only let  
[1:42:25](https://youtu.be/3k6MBedWTww?t=6145) Allah Hill and the Quran says lie lie  
[1:42:26](https://youtu.be/3k6MBedWTww?t=6146) low only God is worthy of worship you  
[1:42:29](https://youtu.be/3k6MBedWTww?t=6149) know these things so one minute I  
[1:42:32](https://youtu.be/3k6MBedWTww?t=6152) appreciate that you've come a bit more  
[1:42:33](https://youtu.be/3k6MBedWTww?t=6153) humble this time and you said I'm  
[1:42:35](https://youtu.be/3k6MBedWTww?t=6155) confused I hope I hope you have  
[1:42:38](https://youtu.be/3k6MBedWTww?t=6158) understood this now and if you don't I  
[1:42:39](https://youtu.be/3k6MBedWTww?t=6159) think you should blame your intellect  
[1:42:41](https://youtu.be/3k6MBedWTww?t=6161) and your lack of knowledge that's that's  
[1:42:43](https://youtu.be/3k6MBedWTww?t=6163) that's the state it should be right now  
[1:42:44](https://youtu.be/3k6MBedWTww?t=6164) but just to just to kind of touch upon  
[1:42:46](https://youtu.be/3k6MBedWTww?t=6166) what you said because I do have a bit of  
[1:42:48](https://youtu.be/3k6MBedWTww?t=6168) time back so Chilean he was a  
[1:42:49](https://youtu.be/3k6MBedWTww?t=6169) subordination list so Julian was a  
[1:42:51](https://youtu.be/3k6MBedWTww?t=6171) subordination is he died 240 I don't  
[1:42:53](https://youtu.be/3k6MBedWTww?t=6173) actually think you read his works yeah I  
[1:42:55](https://youtu.be/3k6MBedWTww?t=6175) don't believe you read his works his  
[1:42:57](https://youtu.be/3k6MBedWTww?t=6177) primary source materials all stipulate  
[1:42:58](https://youtu.be/3k6MBedWTww?t=6178) he does use the language of the fourth  
[1:43:00](https://youtu.be/3k6MBedWTww?t=6180) century men but he does not use it in  
[1:43:02](https://youtu.be/3k6MBedWTww?t=6182) the context of the Holy Spirit and so  
[1:43:05](https://youtu.be/3k6MBedWTww?t=6185) therefore I conclude that so Chilean was  
[1:43:07](https://youtu.be/3k6MBedWTww?t=6187) and that's why he's deemed as a heretic  
[1:43:08](https://youtu.be/3k6MBedWTww?t=6188) by the Catholics he's and and by the  
[1:43:10](https://youtu.be/3k6MBedWTww?t=6190) Protestants he's deemed and other people  
[1:43:12](https://youtu.be/3k6MBedWTww?t=6192) are deemed as heretics so it's a back  
[1:43:14](https://youtu.be/3k6MBedWTww?t=6194) projection based on later developments  
[1:43:16](https://youtu.be/3k6MBedWTww?t=6196) of the church and this is something you  
[1:43:18](https://youtu.be/3k6MBedWTww?t=6198) could not deal with basically in this  
[1:43:20](https://youtu.be/3k6MBedWTww?t=6200) second in the end in this particular in  
[1:43:23](https://youtu.be/3k6MBedWTww?t=6203) this particular debate thank you very  
[1:43:30](https://youtu.be/3k6MBedWTww?t=6210) much mr. job you might go forward with  
[1:43:31](https://youtu.be/3k6MBedWTww?t=6211) your second question all right so you  
[1:43:33](https://youtu.be/3k6MBedWTww?t=6213) you spoke about the attributes of you  
[1:43:36](https://youtu.be/3k6MBedWTww?t=6216) spoke about the attributes of the Holy  
[1:43:37](https://youtu.be/3k6MBedWTww?t=6217) Spirit etc I'm just going to give you  
[1:43:40](https://youtu.be/3k6MBedWTww?t=6220) one example I mean it's a very easy  
[1:43:42](https://youtu.be/3k6MBedWTww?t=6222) question in mark chapter 13 verse 32 it  
[1:43:46](https://youtu.be/3k6MBedWTww?t=6226) says only the Father Knows when the hour  
[1:43:48](https://youtu.be/3k6MBedWTww?t=6228) is now I understand why the son might  
[1:43:51](https://youtu.be/3k6MBedWTww?t=6231) not know because it's the human side you  
[1:43:52](https://youtu.be/3k6MBedWTww?t=6232) see it's the human side so he you know  
[1:43:55](https://youtu.be/3k6MBedWTww?t=6235) the god side might know what the human  
[1:43:57](https://youtu.be/3k6MBedWTww?t=6237) but what about the Holy Spirit why does  
[1:43:59](https://youtu.be/3k6MBedWTww?t=6239) the Holy Spirit not know when the hour  
[1:44:01](https://youtu.be/3k6MBedWTww?t=6241) is  
[1:44:04](https://youtu.be/3k6MBedWTww?t=6244) I have two minutes dr. hood well the  
[1:44:09](https://youtu.be/3k6MBedWTww?t=6249) Holy Spirit is included  
[1:44:11](https://youtu.be/3k6MBedWTww?t=6251) we have elsewhere that the Holy Spirit  
[1:44:14](https://youtu.be/3k6MBedWTww?t=6254) searches the mind of God and knows  
[1:44:15](https://youtu.be/3k6MBedWTww?t=6255) everything that God knows if you look at  
[1:44:18](https://youtu.be/3k6MBedWTww?t=6258) what Jesus is doing there when he says  
[1:44:21](https://youtu.be/3k6MBedWTww?t=6261) when he says no one he's referring to  
[1:44:23](https://youtu.be/3k6MBedWTww?t=6263) the level of human beings by the way if  
[1:44:24](https://youtu.be/3k6MBedWTww?t=6264) you if you guys like that verse that's  
[1:44:27](https://youtu.be/3k6MBedWTww?t=6267) uh if you believe Jesus said that then  
[1:44:29](https://youtu.be/3k6MBedWTww?t=6269) Islam is false because notice you've got  
[1:44:31](https://youtu.be/3k6MBedWTww?t=6271) father and son there according to Quran  
[1:44:33](https://youtu.be/3k6MBedWTww?t=6273) Allah as a father to know in the highest  
[1:44:35](https://youtu.be/3k6MBedWTww?t=6275) relationship you can have with Allah as  
[1:44:36](https://youtu.be/3k6MBedWTww?t=6276) a slave to master relationship so did  
[1:44:39](https://youtu.be/3k6MBedWTww?t=6279) you believe that then Islam is false but  
[1:44:42](https://youtu.be/3k6MBedWTww?t=6282) if you look what he says there already  
[1:44:45](https://youtu.be/3k6MBedWTww?t=6285) he sets up a hierarchy says the day of  
[1:44:48](https://youtu.be/3k6MBedWTww?t=6288) their time he says no one knows  
[1:44:50](https://youtu.be/3k6MBedWTww?t=6290) referring to the level of men and then  
[1:44:52](https://youtu.be/3k6MBedWTww?t=6292) he says not even the angels so that's  
[1:44:56](https://youtu.be/3k6MBedWTww?t=6296) the entire created order no man knows  
[1:44:59](https://youtu.be/3k6MBedWTww?t=6299) not even the angels not even the son  
[1:45:03](https://youtu.be/3k6MBedWTww?t=6303) only the father so even in this verse  
[1:45:06](https://youtu.be/3k6MBedWTww?t=6306) you're quoting he's putting himself one  
[1:45:09](https://youtu.be/3k6MBedWTww?t=6309) minute left he's putting himself above  
[1:45:11](https://youtu.be/3k6MBedWTww?t=6311) all of creation he's putting himself  
[1:45:14](https://youtu.be/3k6MBedWTww?t=6314) above all of creation and so the  
[1:45:17](https://youtu.be/3k6MBedWTww?t=6317) question is why wouldn't why would Jesus  
[1:45:19](https://youtu.be/3k6MBedWTww?t=6319) say that he doesn't know the hour well  
[1:45:20](https://youtu.be/3k6MBedWTww?t=6320) there's there's a long explanation which  
[1:45:23](https://youtu.be/3k6MBedWTww?t=6323) I'm not even sure it is correct but  
[1:45:26](https://youtu.be/3k6MBedWTww?t=6326) usually we would we would explain this  
[1:45:28](https://youtu.be/3k6MBedWTww?t=6328) in terms given the easier one here  
[1:45:32](https://youtu.be/3k6MBedWTww?t=6332) you're interfering of my time here they  
[1:45:35](https://youtu.be/3k6MBedWTww?t=6335) straightforward one is Christians also  
[1:45:38](https://youtu.be/3k6MBedWTww?t=6338) believe in the canosa's when Jesus takes  
[1:45:41](https://youtu.be/3k6MBedWTww?t=6341) on human nature they find this in John  
[1:45:43](https://youtu.be/3k6MBedWTww?t=6343) one and Mohammed mentioned earlier the  
[1:45:47](https://youtu.be/3k6MBedWTww?t=6347) the him to Christ in Philippians where  
[1:45:50](https://youtu.be/3k6MBedWTww?t=6350) it says he was in the form of God but he  
[1:45:52](https://youtu.be/3k6MBedWTww?t=6352) made himself nothing taking on the  
[1:45:54](https://youtu.be/3k6MBedWTww?t=6354) nature of a servant and we believe he  
[1:45:56](https://youtu.be/3k6MBedWTww?t=6356) actually took on the nature of the  
[1:45:58](https://youtu.be/3k6MBedWTww?t=6358) servants and limited himself in that way  
[1:46:01](https://youtu.be/3k6MBedWTww?t=6361) if you believe it's a problem by the way  
[1:46:03](https://youtu.be/3k6MBedWTww?t=6363) I mean think about it the Quran doesn't  
[1:46:04](https://youtu.be/3k6MBedWTww?t=6364) contain verses that the eternal Quran  
[1:46:06](https://youtu.be/3k6MBedWTww?t=6366) has and yet you still believe you have  
[1:46:08](https://youtu.be/3k6MBedWTww?t=6368) the Quran he  
[1:46:09](https://youtu.be/3k6MBedWTww?t=6369) certain things have been withheld from  
[1:46:11](https://youtu.be/3k6MBedWTww?t=6371) you so thank you very much doctor would  
[1:46:14](https://youtu.be/3k6MBedWTww?t=6374) you could start your second question  
[1:46:24](https://youtu.be/3k6MBedWTww?t=6384) right now uh yeah I'm confused by this  
[1:46:30](https://youtu.be/3k6MBedWTww?t=6390) claim which you made earlier that that  
[1:46:32](https://youtu.be/3k6MBedWTww?t=6392) Jews Jews have regarded the doctrine the  
[1:46:36](https://youtu.be/3k6MBedWTww?t=6396) Trinity as polytheism Jews never saw any  
[1:46:38](https://youtu.be/3k6MBedWTww?t=6398) plurality in the Old Testament  
[1:46:40](https://youtu.be/3k6MBedWTww?t=6400) that's simply false before the end of  
[1:46:42](https://youtu.be/3k6MBedWTww?t=6402) the second century AD it was very  
[1:46:44](https://youtu.be/3k6MBedWTww?t=6404) widespread to see a plurality within the  
[1:46:46](https://youtu.be/3k6MBedWTww?t=6406) one God this is from Benjamin's summer  
[1:46:49](https://youtu.be/3k6MBedWTww?t=6409) from the Jewish Theological Seminary in  
[1:46:51](https://youtu.be/3k6MBedWTww?t=6411) New York who writes no Jew sensitive to  
[1:46:54](https://youtu.be/3k6MBedWTww?t=6414) Judaism's own classical sources can  
[1:46:57](https://youtu.be/3k6MBedWTww?t=6417) fault the theological model Christianity  
[1:46:59](https://youtu.be/3k6MBedWTww?t=6419) employs when it avails belief in a God  
[1:47:01](https://youtu.be/3k6MBedWTww?t=6421) who has an earthly body as well as a  
[1:47:03](https://youtu.be/3k6MBedWTww?t=6423) Holy Spirit and heavenly manifestation  
[1:47:06](https://youtu.be/3k6MBedWTww?t=6426) for that model we have seen is a  
[1:47:08](https://youtu.be/3k6MBedWTww?t=6428) perfectly Jewish one a religion whose  
[1:47:10](https://youtu.be/3k6MBedWTww?t=6430) scripture contains the fluidity  
[1:47:12](https://youtu.be/3k6MBedWTww?t=6432) traditions whose teachings emphasize the  
[1:47:14](https://youtu.be/3k6MBedWTww?t=6434) multiplicity of the Shekinah and whose  
[1:47:17](https://youtu.be/3k6MBedWTww?t=6437) thinkers speak of the sefirot does not  
[1:47:20](https://youtu.be/3k6MBedWTww?t=6440) differ in its theological essentials  
[1:47:22](https://youtu.be/3k6MBedWTww?t=6442) from a religion question its questioning  
[1:47:26](https://youtu.be/3k6MBedWTww?t=6446) so if Jewish scholars who are  
[1:47:29](https://youtu.be/3k6MBedWTww?t=6449) acknowledging that the turn to  
[1:47:32](https://youtu.be/3k6MBedWTww?t=6452) Unitarianism only arose in the second  
[1:47:34](https://youtu.be/3k6MBedWTww?t=6454) century as a reaction to Christianity to  
[1:47:36](https://youtu.be/3k6MBedWTww?t=6456) set themselves against the Christians  
[1:47:37](https://youtu.be/3k6MBedWTww?t=6457) more how can you say that Jews never saw  
[1:47:41](https://youtu.be/3k6MBedWTww?t=6461) this when it's widely understood that  
[1:47:42](https://youtu.be/3k6MBedWTww?t=6462) they did have two minutes thank you for  
[1:47:46](https://youtu.be/3k6MBedWTww?t=6466) that question he talks about in the last  
[1:47:49](https://youtu.be/3k6MBedWTww?t=6469) part of his speech the Shama and how it  
[1:47:51](https://youtu.be/3k6MBedWTww?t=6471) can mean three gods now he's speaking  
[1:47:53](https://youtu.be/3k6MBedWTww?t=6473) about he spoke about three minutes about  
[1:47:55](https://youtu.be/3k6MBedWTww?t=6475) Prophet Muhammad spitting I believe you  
[1:47:57](https://youtu.be/3k6MBedWTww?t=6477) me I think that generally speaking if  
[1:48:00](https://youtu.be/3k6MBedWTww?t=6480) you saw if you give your exegetical  
[1:48:02](https://youtu.be/3k6MBedWTww?t=6482) interpretation to a rabbi I think you  
[1:48:04](https://youtu.be/3k6MBedWTww?t=6484) would spit at you  
[1:48:05](https://youtu.be/3k6MBedWTww?t=6485) because I don't think anybody of the  
[1:48:08](https://youtu.be/3k6MBedWTww?t=6488) Jewish in 4,000 years of Hebrew history  
[1:48:11](https://youtu.be/3k6MBedWTww?t=6491) has ever believed in what you say that  
[1:48:14](https://youtu.be/3k6MBedWTww?t=6494) they believed give me one primary source  
[1:48:16](https://youtu.be/3k6MBedWTww?t=6496) of any Jew that believed in the Trinity  
[1:48:21](https://youtu.be/3k6MBedWTww?t=6501) one don't give me Benjamin Summers is a  
[1:48:24](https://youtu.be/3k6MBedWTww?t=6504) secondary source of material you're

[1:48:34](https://youtu.be/3k6MBedWTww?t=6514) me a primary source material of a Jew  
[1:48:36](https://youtu.be/3k6MBedWTww?t=6516) who believed three co-equal Co eternal  
[1:48:42](https://youtu.be/3k6MBedWTww?t=6522) independent beings you will never all  
[1:48:45](https://youtu.be/3k6MBedWTww?t=6525) persons of a bill of one God you will

[1:48:54](https://youtu.be/3k6MBedWTww?t=6534) I mean it was pretty easy to answer his  
[1:48:57](https://youtu.be/3k6MBedWTww?t=6537) question actually I'll give it to him  
[1:49:00](https://youtu.be/3k6MBedWTww?t=6540) man I don't need to I'll give it to him  
[1:49:01](https://youtu.be/3k6MBedWTww?t=6541) I'll give it to is it my turn to ask  
[1:49:09](https://youtu.be/3k6MBedWTww?t=6549) yeah okay I'll give you a primary source  
[1:49:15](https://youtu.be/3k6MBedWTww?t=6555) material Justin Martyr was a was a  
[1:49:20](https://youtu.be/3k6MBedWTww?t=6560) church father as you know who was very  
[1:49:24](https://youtu.be/3k6MBedWTww?t=6564) early I think he died 110 or something  
[1:49:26](https://youtu.be/3k6MBedWTww?t=6566) like that ad and he wrote a book called  
[1:49:28](https://youtu.be/3k6MBedWTww?t=6568) the first apologies in chapter 21 of  
[1:49:31](https://youtu.be/3k6MBedWTww?t=6571) this book  
[1:49:33](https://youtu.be/3k6MBedWTww?t=6573) Justin mata was having a conversation  
[1:49:35](https://youtu.be/3k6MBedWTww?t=6575) with a pagan okay and he said to the  
[1:49:39](https://youtu.be/3k6MBedWTww?t=6579) purse of the pagan he said to him that  
[1:49:43](https://youtu.be/3k6MBedWTww?t=6583) just as you believe that Jupiter is God  
[1:49:47](https://youtu.be/3k6MBedWTww?t=6587) and there are sons of Jupiter we believe  
[1:49:51](https://youtu.be/3k6MBedWTww?t=6591) that the father is God and Jesus is the  
[1:49:53](https://youtu.be/3k6MBedWTww?t=6593) Son of God my question to you is this  
[1:49:58](https://youtu.be/3k6MBedWTww?t=6598) how can you assure us today that in the  
[1:50:02](https://youtu.be/3k6MBedWTww?t=6602) first 300 years of Christian history  
[1:50:04](https://youtu.be/3k6MBedWTww?t=6604) that there has not been a  
[1:50:07](https://youtu.be/3k6MBedWTww?t=6607) mythological influence in the  
[1:50:12](https://youtu.be/3k6MBedWTww?t=6612) formulation of the Trinity you have two  
[1:50:16](https://youtu.be/3k6MBedWTww?t=6616) minutes dr. Woodley  
[1:50:17](https://youtu.be/3k6MBedWTww?t=6617) [Applause]  
[1:50:20](https://youtu.be/3k6MBedWTww?t=6620) well we we have first century documents  
[1:50:27](https://youtu.be/3k6MBedWTww?t=6627) right with the the possible exception of  
[1:50:30](https://youtu.be/3k6MBedWTww?t=6630) Luke they're all devout Jews they had  
[1:50:34](https://youtu.be/3k6MBedWTww?t=6634) utter contempt for the religions of the  
[1:50:39](https://youtu.be/3k6MBedWTww?t=6639) pagans of the polytheists the scriptures  
[1:50:41](https://youtu.be/3k6MBedWTww?t=6641) that they appeal to are the Old  
[1:50:44](https://youtu.be/3k6MBedWTww?t=6644) Testament these guys were thoroughly  
[1:50:46](https://youtu.be/3k6MBedWTww?t=6646) Jewish they appealed to Old Testament  
[1:50:49](https://youtu.be/3k6MBedWTww?t=6649) prophecies they are devout monotheists  
[1:50:55](https://youtu.be/3k6MBedWTww?t=6655) the views they came to have about Jesus  
[1:50:58](https://youtu.be/3k6MBedWTww?t=6658) and the Holy Spirit came from Jesus and  
[1:51:00](https://youtu.be/3k6MBedWTww?t=6660) the Holy Spirit they didn't go up to  
[1:51:02](https://youtu.be/3k6MBedWTww?t=6662) Europe and get something about Zeus or  
[1:51:04](https://youtu.be/3k6MBedWTww?t=6664) something like that so we know where  
[1:51:07](https://youtu.be/3k6MBedWTww?t=6667) their beliefs came from right Jesus  
[1:51:09](https://youtu.be/3k6MBedWTww?t=6669) comes in the world Jesus makes all kinds  
[1:51:11](https://youtu.be/3k6MBedWTww?t=6671) of claims these guys many of these early  
[1:51:13](https://youtu.be/3k6MBedWTww?t=6673) Christians went to their horrible bloody  
[1:51:16](https://youtu.be/3k6MBedWTww?t=6676) deaths proclaiming that Jesus is Lord  
[1:51:20](https://youtu.be/3k6MBedWTww?t=6680) one minute left  
[1:51:22](https://youtu.be/3k6MBedWTww?t=6682) if they were just sort of trying to  
[1:51:24](https://youtu.be/3k6MBedWTww?t=6684) compromise or picking up something they  
[1:51:26](https://youtu.be/3k6MBedWTww?t=6686) heard in in the market they they  
[1:51:31](https://youtu.be/3k6MBedWTww?t=6691) wouldn't have to deal with that sort of  
[1:51:32](https://youtu.be/3k6MBedWTww?t=6692) thing as for as for Justin Martyr now  
[1:51:35](https://youtu.be/3k6MBedWTww?t=6695) Justin everyone acknowledges that Justin  
[1:51:37](https://youtu.be/3k6MBedWTww?t=6697) Martyr makes a bad comparison but he's  
[1:51:39](https://youtu.be/3k6MBedWTww?t=6699) actually appealing to the Rome leaders  
[1:51:41](https://youtu.be/3k6MBedWTww?t=6701) to stop persecuting Christians making a  
[1:51:44](https://youtu.be/3k6MBedWTww?t=6704) plea here stop stop killing us stop the  
[1:51:46](https://youtu.be/3k6MBedWTww?t=6706) persecutions please we're begging you  
[1:51:49](https://youtu.be/3k6MBedWTww?t=6709) and in this is well you know we believe  
[1:51:53](https://youtu.be/3k6MBedWTww?t=6713) Jesus the Son of God you believe in sons  
[1:51:54](https://youtu.be/3k6MBedWTww?t=6714) of God so where are you guys out here  
[1:51:56](https://youtu.be/3k6MBedWTww?t=6716) where you why are you guys out here  
[1:51:58](https://youtu.be/3k6MBedWTww?t=6718) persecuting us you can't draw a  
[1:52:00](https://youtu.be/3k6MBedWTww?t=6720) tremendous amount of that about our  
[1:52:04](https://youtu.be/3k6MBedWTww?t=6724) theology coming from them especially  
[1:52:08](https://youtu.be/3k6MBedWTww?t=6728) when you have Old Testament passages  
[1:52:10](https://youtu.be/3k6MBedWTww?t=6730) send out the son the Messiah  
[1:52:13](https://youtu.be/3k6MBedWTww?t=6733) and the Messiah being the Sun and the  
[1:52:15](https://youtu.be/3k6MBedWTww?t=6735) Sun beating the mighty God thank you  
[1:52:18](https://youtu.be/3k6MBedWTww?t=6738) very much doctor would you may ask your  
[1:52:21](https://youtu.be/3k6MBedWTww?t=6741) third question yes Touhey when we look  
[1:52:33](https://youtu.be/3k6MBedWTww?t=6753) at all the things we have here we have  
[1:52:35](https://youtu.be/3k6MBedWTww?t=6755) the eternal word of allah which is co  
[1:52:38](https://youtu.be/3k6MBedWTww?t=6758) eternal and so he's got his Co eternal  
[1:52:39](https://youtu.be/3k6MBedWTww?t=6759) word with them we've got a spirit we've  
[1:52:42](https://youtu.be/3k6MBedWTww?t=6762) got all of these different things going  
[1:52:44](https://youtu.be/3k6MBedWTww?t=6764) on and then you have the word tell heed  
[1:52:49](https://youtu.be/3k6MBedWTww?t=6769) to describe it which doesn't simply mean  
[1:52:51](https://youtu.be/3k6MBedWTww?t=6771) oneness as I understand it's right so  
[1:52:53](https://youtu.be/3k6MBedWTww?t=6773) since you're talking about the Arabic  
[1:52:55](https://youtu.be/3k6MBedWTww?t=6775) here as I understand it comes from Ojeda  
[1:52:58](https://youtu.be/3k6MBedWTww?t=6778) which means to unify and therefore  
[1:53:01](https://youtu.be/3k6MBedWTww?t=6781) tawheed means the unification but if  
[1:53:04](https://youtu.be/3k6MBedWTww?t=6784) you're unifying something then you're  
[1:53:05](https://youtu.be/3k6MBedWTww?t=6785) bringing different things together and  
[1:53:07](https://youtu.be/3k6MBedWTww?t=6787) so if we look and we see these flocks of  
[1:53:10](https://youtu.be/3k6MBedWTww?t=6790) birds taking the place of the pagan  
[1:53:13](https://youtu.be/3k6MBedWTww?t=6793) goddesses and interceding for you and  
[1:53:15](https://youtu.be/3k6MBedWTww?t=6795) things like that could this word tell  
[1:53:21](https://youtu.be/3k6MBedWTww?t=6801) heed means something beyond oneness here  
[1:53:24](https://youtu.be/3k6MBedWTww?t=6804) when we see all of these different  
[1:53:25](https://youtu.be/3k6MBedWTww?t=6805) things if Allah is trying to avoid  
[1:53:27](https://youtu.be/3k6MBedWTww?t=6807) anything but Touhey and you've got all  
[1:53:29](https://youtu.be/3k6MBedWTww?t=6809) of these different things and things  
[1:53:31](https://youtu.be/3k6MBedWTww?t=6811) that are Co eternal with them and  
[1:53:33](https://youtu.be/3k6MBedWTww?t=6813) interceding flocks of birds how do we  
[1:53:39](https://youtu.be/3k6MBedWTww?t=6819) reconcile all this okay thank you so  
[1:53:43](https://youtu.be/3k6MBedWTww?t=6823) here is a we equal a muster in the  
[1:53:45](https://youtu.be/3k6MBedWTww?t=6825) Arabic language yes you're right to say  
[1:53:47](https://youtu.be/3k6MBedWTww?t=6827) it comes from the Arabic word Waheeda  
[1:53:49](https://youtu.be/3k6MBedWTww?t=6829) which means unifying something and it  
[1:53:53](https://youtu.be/3k6MBedWTww?t=6833) could mean different things in different  
[1:53:54](https://youtu.be/3k6MBedWTww?t=6834) contexts for sure now the quran let's  
[1:53:57](https://youtu.be/3k6MBedWTww?t=6837) look at what the quran actually says the  
[1:53:58](https://youtu.be/3k6MBedWTww?t=6838) quran says cool who allah who one more  
[1:54:02](https://youtu.be/3k6MBedWTww?t=6842) time one more time thank you one more  
[1:54:05](https://youtu.be/3k6MBedWTww?t=6845) time one more time  
[1:54:08](https://youtu.be/3k6MBedWTww?t=6848) okay okay ahead in Arabic language means  
[1:54:13](https://youtu.be/3k6MBedWTww?t=6853) the one and only yes there was this  
[1:54:17](https://youtu.be/3k6MBedWTww?t=6857) difference in were hit and I had warhead  
[1:54:19](https://youtu.be/3k6MBedWTww?t=6859) could mean something which is cardinally  
[1:54:21](https://youtu.be/3k6MBedWTww?t=6861) counted there's cardinal numbers one the  
[1:54:25](https://youtu.be/3k6MBedWTww?t=6865) first second third yes what I hate yeah  
[1:54:28](https://youtu.be/3k6MBedWTww?t=6868) but I had can never be so means one and  
[1:54:33](https://youtu.be/3k6MBedWTww?t=6873) only that's what the Koran says in one  
[1:54:35](https://youtu.be/3k6MBedWTww?t=6875) of the smallest chapters when you say  
[1:54:39](https://youtu.be/3k6MBedWTww?t=6879) that the the Quran one minute left the  
[1:54:42](https://youtu.be/3k6MBedWTww?t=6882) Quran this is this is a most half okay  
[1:54:44](https://youtu.be/3k6MBedWTww?t=6884) these are pages and this this is these  
[1:54:47](https://youtu.be/3k6MBedWTww?t=6887) are pages right  
[1:54:48](https://youtu.be/3k6MBedWTww?t=6888) we don't believe these pages and this  
[1:54:49](https://youtu.be/3k6MBedWTww?t=6889) ink is co eternal we don't believe that  
[1:54:53](https://youtu.be/3k6MBedWTww?t=6893) John Jennison I'm saying these pages and  
[1:54:56](https://youtu.be/3k6MBedWTww?t=6896) this thing this this is not we don't  
[1:54:59](https://youtu.be/3k6MBedWTww?t=6899) really have never said no Muslim has  
[1:55:01](https://youtu.be/3k6MBedWTww?t=6901) ever said in history that this is Co  
[1:55:03](https://youtu.be/3k6MBedWTww?t=6903) eternal it's never there not even the  
[1:55:05](https://youtu.be/3k6MBedWTww?t=6905) martyrs in Exodus by the way from Lhasa  
[1:55:07](https://youtu.be/3k6MBedWTww?t=6907) not our lightest we don't have to say  
[1:55:09](https://youtu.be/3k6MBedWTww?t=6909) three ad  
[1:55:09](https://youtu.be/3k6MBedWTww?t=6909) aah so no one has said that what we  
[1:55:12](https://youtu.be/3k6MBedWTww?t=6912) believe is that the Kalam of Allah which  
[1:55:14](https://youtu.be/3k6MBedWTww?t=6914) is the words of Allah are an attribute  
[1:55:16](https://youtu.be/3k6MBedWTww?t=6916) of God without mchb we don't make we  
[1:55:20](https://youtu.be/3k6MBedWTww?t=6920) don't like in it and that the Quran  
[1:55:23](https://youtu.be/3k6MBedWTww?t=6923) spoken from Allah is a subset of that  
[1:55:26](https://youtu.be/3k6MBedWTww?t=6926) attribute that's our belief not this  
[1:55:28](https://youtu.be/3k6MBedWTww?t=6928) physical thing here that you see with  
[1:55:30](https://youtu.be/3k6MBedWTww?t=6930) the patron saint we don't believe in

[1:55:51](https://youtu.be/3k6MBedWTww?t=6951) the question I have is looking at a lot  
[1:55:55](https://youtu.be/3k6MBedWTww?t=6955) of your content online in the past week  
[1:55:58](https://youtu.be/3k6MBedWTww?t=6958) or two I found that seemingly I mean you  
[1:56:02](https://youtu.be/3k6MBedWTww?t=6962) can correct me if I'm wrong yeah you  
[1:56:03](https://youtu.be/3k6MBedWTww?t=6963) seem to make a moral case for  
[1:56:07](https://youtu.be/3k6MBedWTww?t=6967) Christianity in a moral case against  
[1:56:08](https://youtu.be/3k6MBedWTww?t=6968) Islam I watched one of your videos with  
[1:56:11](https://youtu.be/3k6MBedWTww?t=6971) someone called Elliot I I think his name  
[1:56:13](https://youtu.be/3k6MBedWTww?t=6973) was and he made the point he asked you a  
[1:56:15](https://youtu.be/3k6MBedWTww?t=6975) question  
[1:56:16](https://youtu.be/3k6MBedWTww?t=6976) it's on the record he said if Jesus and  
[1:56:19](https://youtu.be/3k6MBedWTww?t=6979) this what we've been talking about today  
[1:56:21](https://youtu.be/3k6MBedWTww?t=6981) is the author of the Old Testament if  
[1:56:24](https://youtu.be/3k6MBedWTww?t=6984) Jesus is the author of the Old Testament  
[1:56:26](https://youtu.be/3k6MBedWTww?t=6986) how can you explain all of the things  
[1:56:29](https://youtu.be/3k6MBedWTww?t=6989) which is deemed as immoral because as a  
[1:56:32](https://youtu.be/3k6MBedWTww?t=6992) divine command theorist I would expect  
[1:56:35](https://youtu.be/3k6MBedWTww?t=6995) you to believe that all of the things in  
[1:56:37](https://youtu.be/3k6MBedWTww?t=6997) the Old Testament in terms of  
[1:56:39](https://youtu.be/3k6MBedWTww?t=6999) injunctions if there had been made by  
[1:56:40](https://youtu.be/3k6MBedWTww?t=7000) Jesus who is meant to be the author of  
[1:56:42](https://youtu.be/3k6MBedWTww?t=7002) the Old Testament God the triune God  
[1:56:44](https://youtu.be/3k6MBedWTww?t=7004) would have been good but you actually  
[1:56:47](https://youtu.be/3k6MBedWTww?t=7007) said it's bad there are lots of Baptist  
[1:56:49](https://youtu.be/3k6MBedWTww?t=7009) these rewards there are lots of bad  
[1:56:50](https://youtu.be/3k6MBedWTww?t=7010) things in the Old Testament  
[1:56:52](https://youtu.be/3k6MBedWTww?t=7012) now if Jesus is God and he's the old  
[1:56:54](https://youtu.be/3k6MBedWTww?t=7014) four author of the Old Testament and he  
[1:56:57](https://youtu.be/3k6MBedWTww?t=7017) has bad injunctions how can you  
[1:57:00](https://youtu.be/3k6MBedWTww?t=7020) reconcile the fact that God a maximally  
[1:57:03](https://youtu.be/3k6MBedWTww?t=7023) perfect good being could give us bad  
[1:57:06](https://youtu.be/3k6MBedWTww?t=7026) injunctions  
[1:57:12](https://youtu.be/3k6MBedWTww?t=7032) Doctorow do you have two minutes yeah I  
[1:57:14](https://youtu.be/3k6MBedWTww?t=7034) don't recall saying bad things I have to  
[1:57:17](https://youtu.be/3k6MBedWTww?t=7037) take a look at the clip I did  
[1:57:19](https://youtu.be/3k6MBedWTww?t=7039) acknowledge that there all I said there  
[1:57:21](https://youtu.be/3k6MBedWTww?t=7041) are all sorts of things in the in the  
[1:57:23](https://youtu.be/3k6MBedWTww?t=7043) Bible that bother me  
[1:57:24](https://youtu.be/3k6MBedWTww?t=7044) I do recall saying that and what I mean  
[1:57:27](https://youtu.be/3k6MBedWTww?t=7047) by that is I'm a philosopher I'm a  
[1:57:29](https://youtu.be/3k6MBedWTww?t=7049) former atheist when and this would go  
[1:57:32](https://youtu.be/3k6MBedWTww?t=7052) for the Quran as well when when you know  
[1:57:34](https://youtu.be/3k6MBedWTww?t=7054) things in passages talking about Hell or  
[1:57:37](https://youtu.be/3k6MBedWTww?t=7057) something like that eternal torment or  
[1:57:39](https://youtu.be/3k6MBedWTww?t=7059) warfare or something like that  
[1:57:41](https://youtu.be/3k6MBedWTww?t=7061) those things bother me that doesn't mean  
[1:57:44](https://youtu.be/3k6MBedWTww?t=7064) I reject that they're from God actually  
[1:57:45](https://youtu.be/3k6MBedWTww?t=7065) okay those are something I've noticed a  
[1:57:47](https://youtu.be/3k6MBedWTww?t=7067) mindset in Islam that if you accept  
[1:57:49](https://youtu.be/3k6MBedWTww?t=7069) Islam you you can never really think  
[1:57:52](https://youtu.be/3k6MBedWTww?t=7072) critically about it and I can't I can't  
[1:57:56](https://youtu.be/3k6MBedWTww?t=7076) be like that  
[1:57:56](https://youtu.be/3k6MBedWTww?t=7076) so always I'm always wrestling with  
[1:57:59](https://youtu.be/3k6MBedWTww?t=7079) issues Old Testament and New Testament  
[1:58:02](https://youtu.be/3k6MBedWTww?t=7082) and with the Quran as well so as far as  
[1:58:04](https://youtu.be/3k6MBedWTww?t=7084) as far as them the moral case if we're  
[1:58:08](https://youtu.be/3k6MBedWTww?t=7088) talking about  
[1:58:10](https://youtu.be/3k6MBedWTww?t=7090) Old Testament passages looking at those  
[1:58:11](https://youtu.be/3k6MBedWTww?t=7091) things yeah I would say these things are  
[1:58:13](https://youtu.be/3k6MBedWTww?t=7093) these things they're you know the one  
[1:58:16](https://youtu.be/3k6MBedWTww?t=7096) minute left entering the land of Canaan  
[1:58:18](https://youtu.be/3k6MBedWTww?t=7098) and fighting the Canaanites and so on  
[1:58:19](https://youtu.be/3k6MBedWTww?t=7099) those things those things they make me  
[1:58:21](https://youtu.be/3k6MBedWTww?t=7101) wonder sometimes but if you believe that  
[1:58:25](https://youtu.be/3k6MBedWTww?t=7105) Jesus rose from the dead then you have  
[1:58:28](https://youtu.be/3k6MBedWTww?t=7108) to say okay if Jesus rose from the dead  
[1:58:29](https://youtu.be/3k6MBedWTww?t=7109) then if I'm going to listen to anyone  
[1:58:31](https://youtu.be/3k6MBedWTww?t=7111) tell me about God I'm going to listen to  
[1:58:34](https://youtu.be/3k6MBedWTww?t=7114) Jesus and so if he's Lord then hey if  
[1:58:38](https://youtu.be/3k6MBedWTww?t=7118) something bothers me that's my problem  
[1:58:39](https://youtu.be/3k6MBedWTww?t=7119) right that's my problem that's something  
[1:58:41](https://youtu.be/3k6MBedWTww?t=7121) I have to wrestle with God accepts that  
[1:58:43](https://youtu.be/3k6MBedWTww?t=7123) we have to wrestle with think the Psalms  
[1:58:44](https://youtu.be/3k6MBedWTww?t=7124) are filled with people really really  
[1:58:46](https://youtu.be/3k6MBedWTww?t=7126) wondering why certain things are  
[1:58:48](https://youtu.be/3k6MBedWTww?t=7128) happening and I don't think that's a bad  
[1:58:50](https://youtu.be/3k6MBedWTww?t=7130) thing and I don't think God thinks it's  
[1:58:51](https://youtu.be/3k6MBedWTww?t=7131) a bad thing when we look at something  
[1:58:53](https://youtu.be/3k6MBedWTww?t=7133) and go wow that's really rough now I  
[1:58:55](https://youtu.be/3k6MBedWTww?t=7135) really want to I really want to think  
[1:58:56](https://youtu.be/3k6MBedWTww?t=7136) about that so I don't see there's any  
[1:58:58](https://youtu.be/3k6MBedWTww?t=7138) big problem if something bothers me but  
[1:59:00](https://youtu.be/3k6MBedWTww?t=7140) I'm convinced that I have good reasons  
[1:59:03](https://youtu.be/3k6MBedWTww?t=7143) to believe in Christianity then 10  
[1:59:04](https://youtu.be/3k6MBedWTww?t=7144) seconds I don't really see the problem  
[1:59:06](https://youtu.be/3k6MBedWTww?t=7146) and that's why I would still accept it  
[1:59:09](https://youtu.be/3k6MBedWTww?t=7149) because Jesus rose from the dead thank  
[1:59:13](https://youtu.be/3k6MBedWTww?t=7153) you doctor would  
[1:59:15](https://youtu.be/3k6MBedWTww?t=7155) you may ask your fourth question yes in  
[1:59:21](https://youtu.be/3k6MBedWTww?t=7161) the hadith I'm wondering because when  
[1:59:24](https://youtu.be/3k6MBedWTww?t=7164) Allah says however you want to translate  
[1:59:27](https://youtu.be/3k6MBedWTww?t=7167) it he says he prays and the angels pray  
[1:59:31](https://youtu.be/3k6MBedWTww?t=7171) therefore you pray it's like he's  
[1:59:32](https://youtu.be/3k6MBedWTww?t=7172) setting himself up as a model so however  
[1:59:34](https://youtu.be/3k6MBedWTww?t=7174) you want to translate that that's not  
[1:59:35](https://youtu.be/3k6MBedWTww?t=7175) fun I'm not talking about that but he's  
[1:59:37](https://youtu.be/3k6MBedWTww?t=7177) setting himself up as a kind of model  
[1:59:38](https://youtu.be/3k6MBedWTww?t=7178) for behavior but in hadith we read  
[1:59:40](https://youtu.be/3k6MBedWTww?t=7180) Muhammad's saying that if you swear  
[1:59:44](https://youtu.be/3k6MBedWTww?t=7184) about Heidi's yeah it was questioned  
[1:59:46](https://youtu.be/3k6MBedWTww?t=7186) yeah if you swear by anything other than  
[1:59:49](https://youtu.be/3k6MBedWTww?t=7189) Allah you're committing shirk and  
[1:59:51](https://youtu.be/3k6MBedWTww?t=7191) setting it up as a partner with Allah so  
[1:59:53](https://youtu.be/3k6MBedWTww?t=7193) if Muhammad says that swearing by  
[1:59:55](https://youtu.be/3k6MBedWTww?t=7195) anything is committing shirk and in the  
[1:59:57](https://youtu.be/3k6MBedWTww?t=7197) Quran Allah swears by literally  
[1:59:59](https://youtu.be/3k6MBedWTww?t=7199) everything he swears by all kinds of  
[2:00:01](https://youtu.be/3k6MBedWTww?t=7201) things and then says he swears by the  
[2:00:02](https://youtu.be/3k6MBedWTww?t=7202) seen and the unseen then if Muhammad  
[2:00:06](https://youtu.be/3k6MBedWTww?t=7206) says doing this is shirk and Allah then  
[2:00:09](https://youtu.be/3k6MBedWTww?t=7209) does it with literally everything  
[2:00:11](https://youtu.be/3k6MBedWTww?t=7211) doesn't this sound more like pantheism  
[2:00:14](https://youtu.be/3k6MBedWTww?t=7214) then if everything is set up with a  
[2:00:17](https://youtu.be/3k6MBedWTww?t=7217) partner as a partner with Allah so it's  
[2:00:19](https://youtu.be/3k6MBedWTww?t=7219) mainly about what sort of things Allah  
[2:00:21](https://youtu.be/3k6MBedWTww?t=7221) has to do when Muhammad lays down rules  
[2:00:22](https://youtu.be/3k6MBedWTww?t=7222) like that  
[2:00:23](https://youtu.be/3k6MBedWTww?t=7223) you have two minutes thank you by  
[2:00:28](https://youtu.be/3k6MBedWTww?t=7228) definition can only be done by other  
[2:00:31](https://youtu.be/3k6MBedWTww?t=7231) than Allah by definition  
[2:00:37](https://youtu.be/3k6MBedWTww?t=7237) because it means associating  
[2:00:40](https://youtu.be/3k6MBedWTww?t=7240) partners with allah that's what that's  
[2:00:44](https://youtu.be/3k6MBedWTww?t=7244) what shirk is associating partners with  
[2:00:46](https://youtu.be/3k6MBedWTww?t=7246) Allah so Allah can not it's not within a  
[2:00:50](https://youtu.be/3k6MBedWTww?t=7250) lot of attributes to do it's not  
[2:00:53](https://youtu.be/3k6MBedWTww?t=7253) possible that's not a possibility right  
[2:00:55](https://youtu.be/3k6MBedWTww?t=7255) so the question that you ask is about  
[2:00:58](https://youtu.be/3k6MBedWTww?t=7258) how comes Allah a person will be had and  
[2:01:01](https://youtu.be/3k6MBedWTww?t=7261) valid levels may be either always in the  
[2:01:03](https://youtu.be/3k6MBedWTww?t=7263) world fedorov and all this  
[2:01:04](https://youtu.be/3k6MBedWTww?t=7264) he makes cool Qasim he does always in  
[2:01:07](https://youtu.be/3k6MBedWTww?t=7267) the Quran well Allah even doesn't offer  
[2:01:10](https://youtu.be/3k6MBedWTww?t=7270) himself a fellow Arabic a layman who now  
[2:01:14](https://youtu.be/3k6MBedWTww?t=7274) had to hack him or give him a shot  
[2:01:15](https://youtu.be/3k6MBedWTww?t=7275) Saravanan so the point is why does Allah  
[2:01:19](https://youtu.be/3k6MBedWTww?t=7279) have the ability to do to make an oath  
[2:01:21](https://youtu.be/3k6MBedWTww?t=7281) with anything he wants and we can only  
[2:01:24](https://youtu.be/3k6MBedWTww?t=7284) make an oath with Allah because Allah  
[2:01:26](https://youtu.be/3k6MBedWTww?t=7286) owns everything  
[2:01:27](https://youtu.be/3k6MBedWTww?t=7287) one minute land to allah we belong this  
[2:01:30](https://youtu.be/3k6MBedWTww?t=7290) is the reality yes oh and the scholars  
[2:01:33](https://youtu.be/3k6MBedWTww?t=7293) say and the scholars say whatever Allah  
[2:01:36](https://youtu.be/3k6MBedWTww?t=7296) makes an oath off that becomes weaker  
[2:01:38](https://youtu.be/3k6MBedWTww?t=7298) more album chillon it becomes an  
[2:01:40](https://youtu.be/3k6MBedWTww?t=7300) important thing in the Sharia okay now  
[2:01:43](https://youtu.be/3k6MBedWTww?t=7303) really and truly just to because some  
[2:01:45](https://youtu.be/3k6MBedWTww?t=7305) Muslims might be confused with is it  
[2:01:47](https://youtu.be/3k6MBedWTww?t=7307) true that if someone does custom with  
[2:01:49](https://youtu.be/3k6MBedWTww?t=7309) other than Allah that they've committed  
[2:01:51](https://youtu.be/3k6MBedWTww?t=7311) major this is not the view of the  
[2:01:54](https://youtu.be/3k6MBedWTww?t=7314) majority of scholars alright so they say  
[2:01:55](https://youtu.be/3k6MBedWTww?t=7315) that this is a minor kind of just  
[2:01:57](https://youtu.be/3k6MBedWTww?t=7317) for the filthy things don't make takfeer  
[2:02:00](https://youtu.be/3k6MBedWTww?t=7320) of your friends are saying or my mom's  
[2:02:02](https://youtu.be/3k6MBedWTww?t=7322) life yes don't do next communication of  
[2:02:04](https://youtu.be/3k6MBedWTww?t=7324) them so that hopefully answers your  
[2:02:06](https://youtu.be/3k6MBedWTww?t=7326) question thank you you may ask your  
[2:02:12](https://youtu.be/3k6MBedWTww?t=7332) first question oh yes this is really  
[2:02:16](https://youtu.be/3k6MBedWTww?t=7336) interesting to follow up from what you  
[2:02:18](https://youtu.be/3k6MBedWTww?t=7338) said before because it seems to me that  
[2:02:20](https://youtu.be/3k6MBedWTww?t=7340) it was not a satisfactory answer you  
[2:02:22](https://youtu.be/3k6MBedWTww?t=7342) were saying that you were wrestling with  
[2:02:24](https://youtu.be/3k6MBedWTww?t=7344) with these things in the Bible wrestling  
[2:02:27](https://youtu.be/3k6MBedWTww?t=7347) grappling in your mind about these  
[2:02:28](https://youtu.be/3k6MBedWTww?t=7348) things in the Bible in the Old Testament  
[2:02:30](https://youtu.be/3k6MBedWTww?t=7350) you seem to think that morality yes can  
[2:02:36](https://youtu.be/3k6MBedWTww?t=7356) be achieved you're a philosopher yes  
[2:02:39](https://youtu.be/3k6MBedWTww?t=7359) can be achieved from other than an  
[2:02:42](https://youtu.be/3k6MBedWTww?t=7362) objective law it is your suggestion that  
[2:02:43](https://youtu.be/3k6MBedWTww?t=7363) an objective morality can be achieved  
[2:02:45](https://youtu.be/3k6MBedWTww?t=7365) from other than the objective law so I  
[2:02:50](https://youtu.be/3k6MBedWTww?t=7370) want to understand as a are you a divine  
[2:02:54](https://youtu.be/3k6MBedWTww?t=7374) command theorists do you believe that  
[2:02:55](https://youtu.be/3k6MBedWTww?t=7375) the injunctions of God must be perfect  
[2:03:00](https://youtu.be/3k6MBedWTww?t=7380) and if if you do believe this how can  
[2:03:02](https://youtu.be/3k6MBedWTww?t=7382) you explain and you did say bad it can  
[2:03:05](https://youtu.be/3k6MBedWTww?t=7385) easily be retrieved on the ins and I  
[2:03:06](https://youtu.be/3k6MBedWTww?t=7386) listened to it just yesterday you said  
[2:03:08](https://youtu.be/3k6MBedWTww?t=7388) the Old Testament has bad things in it  
[2:03:10](https://youtu.be/3k6MBedWTww?t=7390) you said this yes how can you explain  
[2:03:12](https://youtu.be/3k6MBedWTww?t=7392) that a maximally perfect good God at one  
[2:03:19](https://youtu.be/3k6MBedWTww?t=7399) point and time put forward injunctions  
[2:03:25](https://youtu.be/3k6MBedWTww?t=7405) which could be bad or which otherwise  
[2:03:27](https://youtu.be/3k6MBedWTww?t=7407) bother you can you explain them I have  
[2:03:33](https://youtu.be/3k6MBedWTww?t=7413) two minutes doctor would oh  
[2:03:35](https://youtu.be/3k6MBedWTww?t=7415) I mean if you mean hey you know there's  
[2:03:37](https://youtu.be/3k6MBedWTww?t=7417) all kinds of really bad things going on  
[2:03:39](https://youtu.be/3k6MBedWTww?t=7419) in the Old Testament yes very very bad  
[2:03:41](https://youtu.be/3k6MBedWTww?t=7421) things going on in the Old Testament  
[2:03:42](https://youtu.be/3k6MBedWTww?t=7422) right it's a history right but I mean  
[2:03:45](https://youtu.be/3k6MBedWTww?t=7425) you can take any history book and say oh  
[2:03:47](https://youtu.be/3k6MBedWTww?t=7427) look at all these bad things going on if  
[2:03:49](https://youtu.be/3k6MBedWTww?t=7429) you mean that things you know that did I  
[2:03:52](https://youtu.be/3k6MBedWTww?t=7432) say well you know hey you know I'm  
[2:03:54](https://youtu.be/3k6MBedWTww?t=7434) wondering about this that's not just me  
[2:03:56](https://youtu.be/3k6MBedWTww?t=7436) I mean I'm a diagnosed psychopath right  
[2:03:59](https://youtu.be/3k6MBedWTww?t=7439) I don't have I don't have bad feelings  
[2:04:02](https://youtu.be/3k6MBedWTww?t=7442) about these kinds of things the  
[2:04:05](https://youtu.be/3k6MBedWTww?t=7445) reconciliation is that in the New  
[2:04:07](https://youtu.be/3k6MBedWTww?t=7447) Testament God is defined as love right  
[2:04:10](https://youtu.be/3k6MBedWTww?t=7450) we're told God is love which we only  
[2:04:12](https://youtu.be/3k6MBedWTww?t=7452) understand in a Trinitarian it makes no  
[2:04:14](https://youtu.be/3k6MBedWTww?t=7454) sense for God to be loved from all  
[2:04:17](https://youtu.be/3k6MBedWTww?t=7457) eternity but in the light of the  
[2:04:21](https://youtu.be/3k6MBedWTww?t=7461) doctrine of the Trinity with Father Son  
[2:04:22](https://youtu.be/3k6MBedWTww?t=7462) and Holy Spirit now we can see how God  
[2:04:24](https://youtu.be/3k6MBedWTww?t=7464) can be loved from all eternity not just  
[2:04:26](https://youtu.be/3k6MBedWTww?t=7466) not just one person within God so if  
[2:04:31](https://youtu.be/3k6MBedWTww?t=7471) Jesus says that if we're told that that  
[2:04:34](https://youtu.be/3k6MBedWTww?t=7474) God loves everyone left that we are to  
[2:04:38](https://youtu.be/3k6MBedWTww?t=7478) love everyone that we are to harm no one  
[2:04:41](https://youtu.be/3k6MBedWTww?t=7481) that we are to seek peace with everyone  
[2:04:44](https://youtu.be/3k6MBedWTww?t=7484) we're told these then I have to obey  
[2:04:47](https://youtu.be/3k6MBedWTww?t=7487) these kinds of things and so the  
[2:04:50](https://youtu.be/3k6MBedWTww?t=7490) difficult part the  
[2:04:52](https://youtu.be/3k6MBedWTww?t=7492) part then becomes what would I do about  
[2:04:55](https://youtu.be/3k6MBedWTww?t=7495) these Wars and so on given what I now  
[2:04:57](https://youtu.be/3k6MBedWTww?t=7497) believe about God and so that's where  
[2:05:00](https://youtu.be/3k6MBedWTww?t=7500) the struggle comes in  
[2:05:01](https://youtu.be/3k6MBedWTww?t=7501) fortunately the bible does deal with  
[2:05:03](https://youtu.be/3k6MBedWTww?t=7503) that right jesus says Jesus says Moses  
[2:05:06](https://youtu.be/3k6MBedWTww?t=7506) allowed divorce in these certain in  
[2:05:08](https://youtu.be/3k6MBedWTww?t=7508) these circumstances because of the  
[2:05:10](https://youtu.be/3k6MBedWTww?t=7510) hardness of your heart but from the  
[2:05:12](https://youtu.be/3k6MBedWTww?t=7512) beginning it was not so now look at what  
[2:05:14](https://youtu.be/3k6MBedWTww?t=7514) he said here this is not the will of God  
[2:05:16](https://youtu.be/3k6MBedWTww?t=7516) God is allowing certain things at  
[2:05:18](https://youtu.be/3k6MBedWTww?t=7518) certain times because of the hardness of  
[2:05:20](https://youtu.be/3k6MBedWTww?t=7520) your heart  
[2:05:20](https://youtu.be/3k6MBedWTww?t=7520) so even according to the Bible that is  
[2:05:23](https://youtu.be/3k6MBedWTww?t=7523) not the ideal situation that is not in  
[2:05:25](https://youtu.be/3k6MBedWTww?t=7525) solids will for Humanity God looks down  
[2:05:27](https://youtu.be/3k6MBedWTww?t=7527) and sees a world of sinners and then has  
[2:05:32](https://youtu.be/3k6MBedWTww?t=7532) to deal with that right and it's not  
[2:05:34](https://youtu.be/3k6MBedWTww?t=7534) always it's not always going to be  
[2:05:35](https://youtu.be/3k6MBedWTww?t=7535) pretty but the New Testament affirms  
[2:05:37](https://youtu.be/3k6MBedWTww?t=7537) that the the situations in the Old  
[2:05:39](https://youtu.be/3k6MBedWTww?t=7539) Testament were not always ideal thank  
[2:05:41](https://youtu.be/3k6MBedWTww?t=7541) you doctor would you may ask your fifth  
[2:05:46](https://youtu.be/3k6MBedWTww?t=7546) question yes chapter 61 verse 14 of the  
[2:05:53](https://youtu.be/3k6MBedWTww?t=7553) Quran Allah says that he aided the true  
[2:05:58](https://youtu.be/3k6MBedWTww?t=7558) followers of Jesus until they became  
[2:05:59](https://youtu.be/3k6MBedWTww?t=7559) uppermost now I suppose you can  
[2:06:02](https://youtu.be/3k6MBedWTww?t=7562) interpret that in different ways  
[2:06:03](https://youtu.be/3k6MBedWTww?t=7563) commentators such as Yusuf Ali  
[2:06:04](https://youtu.be/3k6MBedWTww?t=7564) interpreted it specifically to mean that  
[2:06:07](https://youtu.be/3k6MBedWTww?t=7567) Christians the Christian followers of  
[2:06:09](https://youtu.be/3k6MBedWTww?t=7569) Jesus took over the Roman Empire and  
[2:06:11](https://youtu.be/3k6MBedWTww?t=7571) that that's how they that's how they  
[2:06:13](https://youtu.be/3k6MBedWTww?t=7573) became uppermost and and more powerful  
[2:06:16](https://youtu.be/3k6MBedWTww?t=7576) than the Jews who rejected Jesus but we  
[2:06:19](https://youtu.be/3k6MBedWTww?t=7579) know that the Christianity that took  
[2:06:21](https://youtu.be/3k6MBedWTww?t=7581) over Europe took over the Roman Empire  
[2:06:23](https://youtu.be/3k6MBedWTww?t=7583) believed in Jesus death resurrection and  
[2:06:26](https://youtu.be/3k6MBedWTww?t=7586) deity and the Trinity by the time they  
[2:06:28](https://youtu.be/3k6MBedWTww?t=7588) did and so why would Allah help the  
[2:06:32](https://youtu.be/3k6MBedWTww?t=7592) wrong Christians if there were earlier  
[2:06:33](https://youtu.be/3k6MBedWTww?t=7593) Christians who believe the right thing  
[2:06:35](https://youtu.be/3k6MBedWTww?t=7595) why did Allah help the wrong ones  
[2:06:36](https://youtu.be/3k6MBedWTww?t=7596) according to the Quran according to the  
[2:06:38](https://youtu.be/3k6MBedWTww?t=7598) Quran thank you according to the Quran  
[2:06:42](https://youtu.be/3k6MBedWTww?t=7602) the disciples of Jesus the how are you  
[2:06:45](https://youtu.be/3k6MBedWTww?t=7605) were Muslim this is the answer okay the  
[2:06:48](https://youtu.be/3k6MBedWTww?t=7608) Quran says about the Haroon in Chapter  
[2:06:51](https://youtu.be/3k6MBedWTww?t=7611) three of the Quran fresh had bien

[2:06:57](https://youtu.be/3k6MBedWTww?t=7617) that we are Muslims meaning what  
[2:06:59](https://youtu.be/3k6MBedWTww?t=7619) not that they believed in Prophet  
[2:07:00](https://youtu.be/3k6MBedWTww?t=7620) Mohammed know that they were submitters  
[2:07:02](https://youtu.be/3k6MBedWTww?t=7622) to God in the same way that Jesus wasn't  
[2:07:04](https://youtu.be/3k6MBedWTww?t=7624) John chapter 5 verse 30 I don't submit  
[2:07:06](https://youtu.be/3k6MBedWTww?t=7626) myself to my own will but the will of  
[2:07:08](https://youtu.be/3k6MBedWTww?t=7628) God so why did Allah help the hilarion  
[2:07:12](https://youtu.be/3k6MBedWTww?t=7632) in sorts of stuff in chapter 61 of the  
[2:07:14](https://youtu.be/3k6MBedWTww?t=7634) Quran al Imran chapter 3 of the Quran  
[2:07:17](https://youtu.be/3k6MBedWTww?t=7637) because they followed Jesus and he was a  
[2:07:20](https://youtu.be/3k6MBedWTww?t=7640) prophet of God and so therefore Allah he  
[2:07:24](https://youtu.be/3k6MBedWTww?t=7644) helped them because he they followed the  
[2:07:26](https://youtu.be/3k6MBedWTww?t=7646) true prophet at that time and that true  
[2:07:28](https://youtu.be/3k6MBedWTww?t=7648) prophet which we believe in as the  
[2:07:29](https://youtu.be/3k6MBedWTww?t=7649) Messiah was Jesus Christ so it was  
[2:07:32](https://youtu.be/3k6MBedWTww?t=7652) nothing to do with the Roman Empire this

[2:08:12](https://youtu.be/3k6MBedWTww?t=7692) for what you believe you have to go  
[2:08:13](https://youtu.be/3k6MBedWTww?t=7693) further back in time you have to back  
[2:08:14](https://youtu.be/3k6MBedWTww?t=7694) project you have to take the ideas of  
[2:08:16](https://youtu.be/3k6MBedWTww?t=7696) the later people and basically and in  
[2:08:19](https://youtu.be/3k6MBedWTww?t=7699) some terms makes up dia you have to  
[2:08:22](https://youtu.be/3k6MBedWTww?t=7702) render heretical the earlier people we  
[2:08:25](https://youtu.be/3k6MBedWTww?t=7705) as Muslims we believe that the earlier  
[2:08:26](https://youtu.be/3k6MBedWTww?t=7706) peoples of the prophets were the best  
[2:08:28](https://youtu.be/3k6MBedWTww?t=7708) and then they became worse as it goes on  
[2:08:30](https://youtu.be/3k6MBedWTww?t=7710) you as Christians believe in the  
[2:08:32](https://youtu.be/3k6MBedWTww?t=7712) opposite and that's a disaster of a  
[2:08:33](https://youtu.be/3k6MBedWTww?t=7713) belief  
[2:08:37](https://youtu.be/3k6MBedWTww?t=7717) [Music]  
[2:08:39](https://youtu.be/3k6MBedWTww?t=7719) Thank You mr. job and you may ask her  
[2:08:41](https://youtu.be/3k6MBedWTww?t=7721) sixth and final question related to this  
[2:08:44](https://youtu.be/3k6MBedWTww?t=7724) I want to just ask this question one  
[2:08:48](https://youtu.be/3k6MBedWTww?t=7728) last time because I've given him many  
[2:08:50](https://youtu.be/3k6MBedWTww?t=7730) times in this debate an opportunity to  
[2:08:52](https://youtu.be/3k6MBedWTww?t=7732) ask this question okay my question is  
[2:08:55](https://youtu.be/3k6MBedWTww?t=7735) simple I appreciate that  
[2:08:58](https://youtu.be/3k6MBedWTww?t=7738) early church fathers believed that Jesus  
[2:09:02](https://youtu.be/3k6MBedWTww?t=7742) was God some of them did believe that  
[2:09:04](https://youtu.be/3k6MBedWTww?t=7744) some of them believed he was God but not  
[2:09:06](https://youtu.be/3k6MBedWTww?t=7746) co-equal that he was in a hierarchy some  
[2:09:09](https://youtu.be/3k6MBedWTww?t=7749) of them believed he was God but not in  
[2:09:12](https://youtu.be/3k6MBedWTww?t=7752) the same level as like subordination ISM  
[2:09:13](https://youtu.be/3k6MBedWTww?t=7753) right I am asking a question if they  
[2:09:18](https://youtu.be/3k6MBedWTww?t=7758) could designate Jesus as God's co-equal  
[2:09:22](https://youtu.be/3k6MBedWTww?t=7762) and coeternal and they used that  
[2:09:25](https://youtu.be/3k6MBedWTww?t=7765) language respective to Jesus can you  
[2:09:28](https://youtu.be/3k6MBedWTww?t=7768) give me one person who has interpreted  
[2:09:30](https://youtu.be/3k6MBedWTww?t=7770) the New Testament yeah for in the first  
[2:09:33](https://youtu.be/3k6MBedWTww?t=7773) 300 years who has said the same thing  
[2:09:37](https://youtu.be/3k6MBedWTww?t=7777) about the Holy Spirit because if you  
[2:09:40](https://youtu.be/3k6MBedWTww?t=7780) cannot the frank truth is you have a  
[2:09:43](https://youtu.be/3k6MBedWTww?t=7783) baseless foundation for your belief for  
[2:09:46](https://youtu.be/3k6MBedWTww?t=7786) 300 years people would have been the  
[2:09:48](https://youtu.be/3k6MBedWTww?t=7788) farmer as you know what the farmer the  
[2:09:50](https://youtu.be/3k6MBedWTww?t=7790) fisherman the you know the butcher the  
[2:09:53](https://youtu.be/3k6MBedWTww?t=7793) teacher all of those individuals are  
[2:09:55](https://youtu.be/3k6MBedWTww?t=7795) damned to hell  
[2:09:56](https://youtu.be/3k6MBedWTww?t=7796) despite the fact that they had the  
[2:09:58](https://youtu.be/3k6MBedWTww?t=7798) Gospels in front of them because they  
[2:10:01](https://youtu.be/3k6MBedWTww?t=7801) couldn't make the natural inference of  
[2:10:02](https://youtu.be/3k6MBedWTww?t=7802) the Holy Spirit being God can you give  
[2:10:04](https://youtu.be/3k6MBedWTww?t=7804) me one person church father first 300  
[2:10:07](https://youtu.be/3k6MBedWTww?t=7807) years who designated the Holy Spirit as  
[2:10:11](https://youtu.be/3k6MBedWTww?t=7811) co-equal Co eternal independent the same  
[2:10:15](https://youtu.be/3k6MBedWTww?t=7815) language that they use in Nicaea for the  
[2:10:17](https://youtu.be/3k6MBedWTww?t=7817) Holy Spirit please do so  
[2:10:23](https://youtu.be/3k6MBedWTww?t=7823) I'm shocked that people still take this  
[2:10:25](https://youtu.be/3k6MBedWTww?t=7825) here who called the Holy Spirit Khoa  
[2:10:27](https://youtu.be/3k6MBedWTww?t=7827) turned the Bible calls him eternal the  
[2:10:31](https://youtu.be/3k6MBedWTww?t=7831) Bible calls him eternal that language  
[2:10:37](https://youtu.be/3k6MBedWTww?t=7837) that specifically he he said here's a  
[2:10:40](https://youtu.be/3k6MBedWTww?t=7840) counsel in the fourth century that came  
[2:10:41](https://youtu.be/3k6MBedWTww?t=7841) up with a specific way of phrasing  
[2:10:44](https://youtu.be/3k6MBedWTww?t=7844) things  
[2:10:45](https://youtu.be/3k6MBedWTww?t=7845) well that was to help people avoid  
[2:10:46](https://youtu.be/3k6MBedWTww?t=7846) confusion here so if we're saying that  
[2:10:50](https://youtu.be/3k6MBedWTww?t=7850) the Holy Spirit is God father is God the  
[2:10:53](https://youtu.be/3k6MBedWTww?t=7853) Son is God if this is revealed in  
[2:10:56](https://youtu.be/3k6MBedWTww?t=7856) Scripture there's only one God guess  
[2:10:57](https://youtu.be/3k6MBedWTww?t=7857) what that's what they were believing  
[2:10:59](https://youtu.be/3k6MBedWTww?t=7859) time if someone objects at some point  
[2:11:02](https://youtu.be/3k6MBedWTww?t=7862) and says I believe that the Holy Spirit  
[2:11:05](https://youtu.be/3k6MBedWTww?t=7865) is not eternal well then in your Creed  
[2:11:08](https://youtu.be/3k6MBedWTww?t=7868) you need to clarify hey this guy doesn't  
[2:11:11](https://youtu.be/3k6MBedWTww?t=7871) know what he's talking about the Bible  
[2:11:12](https://youtu.be/3k6MBedWTww?t=7872) says that he's eternal  
[2:11:13](https://youtu.be/3k6MBedWTww?t=7873) so he's Co eternal with the father and  
[2:11:16](https://youtu.be/3k6MBedWTww?t=7876) so they put it in a Creed just to be  
[2:11:19](https://youtu.be/3k6MBedWTww?t=7879) clicked Creed's have no authority beyond  
[2:11:21](https://youtu.be/3k6MBedWTww?t=7881) the scripture one minute left  
[2:11:24](https://youtu.be/3k6MBedWTww?t=7884) there's this scripture but it's a lot  
[2:11:27](https://youtu.be/3k6MBedWTww?t=7887) it's 66 books covers 1500 years 40  
[2:11:32](https://youtu.be/3k6MBedWTww?t=7892) different authors right there are  
[2:11:34](https://youtu.be/3k6MBedWTww?t=7894) threads running throughout the scripture  
[2:11:37](https://youtu.be/3k6MBedWTww?t=7897) right the purpose of the Creed is to say  
[2:11:39](https://youtu.be/3k6MBedWTww?t=7899) here's a little short list of the  
[2:11:41](https://youtu.be/3k6MBedWTww?t=7901) essentials here's a short list of the  
[2:11:44](https://youtu.be/3k6MBedWTww?t=7904) essentials to make sure that you're on  
[2:11:45](https://youtu.be/3k6MBedWTww?t=7905) the right side of being an Orthodox  
[2:11:48](https://youtu.be/3k6MBedWTww?t=7908) Christian and so I put a little Creed  
[2:11:51](https://youtu.be/3k6MBedWTww?t=7911) there just because Oh so-and-so is  
[2:11:53](https://youtu.be/3k6MBedWTww?t=7913) coming to a different position and he's  
[2:11:54](https://youtu.be/3k6MBedWTww?t=7914) contradicting the Bible therefore we  
[2:11:56](https://youtu.be/3k6MBedWTww?t=7916) need to make we need to make sure we  
[2:11:57](https://youtu.be/3k6MBedWTww?t=7917) mentioned Co eternal here right but the  
[2:12:00](https://youtu.be/3k6MBedWTww?t=7920) Co eternal does not come from the  
[2:12:02](https://youtu.be/3k6MBedWTww?t=7922) counsel the co eternal comes from the  
[2:12:04](https://youtu.be/3k6MBedWTww?t=7924) Bible right and all of the claims about  
[2:12:06](https://youtu.be/3k6MBedWTww?t=7926) the Equality of the Father the Son and  
[2:12:09](https://youtu.be/3k6MBedWTww?t=7929) the Holy Spirit those come from the  
[2:12:11](https://youtu.be/3k6MBedWTww?t=7931) scripture acknowledging them all as  
[2:12:13](https://youtu.be/3k6MBedWTww?t=7933) Yahweh sin seconds and so you're  
[2:12:17](https://youtu.be/3k6MBedWTww?t=7937) basically saying hey why are you using  
[2:12:18](https://youtu.be/3k6MBedWTww?t=7938) language of clarification later on that  
[2:12:21](https://youtu.be/3k6MBedWTww?t=7941) you didn't use earlier  
[2:12:22](https://youtu.be/3k6MBedWTww?t=7942) well the earlier people have said we  
[2:12:25](https://youtu.be/3k6MBedWTww?t=7945) and he's God so before we start our QA  
[2:12:35](https://youtu.be/3k6MBedWTww?t=7955) each speaker will have five minutes for  
[2:12:37](https://youtu.be/3k6MBedWTww?t=7957) that inclusions anyway he started why  
[2:12:39](https://youtu.be/3k6MBedWTww?t=7959) shouldn't I  
[2:12:40](https://youtu.be/3k6MBedWTww?t=7960) what's that no no I mean he started with  
[2:12:43](https://youtu.be/3k6MBedWTww?t=7963) the question so oh yeah I wasn't  
[2:12:46](https://youtu.be/3k6MBedWTww?t=7966) counting so I wasn't counting but you  
[2:12:48](https://youtu.be/3k6MBedWTww?t=7968) have the six questions there's one final  
[2:12:49](https://youtu.be/3k6MBedWTww?t=7969) question  
[2:12:50](https://youtu.be/3k6MBedWTww?t=7970) okay this is kind of a side issue but I  
[2:12:53](https://youtu.be/3k6MBedWTww?t=7973) was wondering about it because uh  
[2:12:55](https://youtu.be/3k6MBedWTww?t=7975) Mohammed you mentioned the Ebionites as  
[2:13:00](https://youtu.be/3k6MBedWTww?t=7980) early as an early group who didn't  
[2:13:04](https://youtu.be/3k6MBedWTww?t=7984) believe in the deity of Christ the  
[2:13:06](https://youtu.be/3k6MBedWTww?t=7986) Ebionites as I understand that we're a  
[2:13:09](https://youtu.be/3k6MBedWTww?t=7989) group they didn't have the Bible they  
[2:13:11](https://youtu.be/3k6MBedWTww?t=7991) only had part of the Gospel of Matthew  
[2:13:13](https://youtu.be/3k6MBedWTww?t=7993) so they had part of the Gospel of  
[2:13:16](https://youtu.be/3k6MBedWTww?t=7996) Matthew and in that part of the Gospel  
[2:13:17](https://youtu.be/3k6MBedWTww?t=7997) of Matthew even have the beginning but  
[2:13:19](https://youtu.be/3k6MBedWTww?t=7999) they also rejected the virgin birth they  
[2:13:22](https://youtu.be/3k6MBedWTww?t=8002) didn't believe that prophets actually  
[2:13:24](https://youtu.be/3k6MBedWTww?t=8004) got revelations from God the prophets  
[2:13:25](https://youtu.be/3k6MBedWTww?t=8005) spoke on their own wisdom so if we're  
[2:13:27](https://youtu.be/3k6MBedWTww?t=8007) taking the Ebionites as the true  
[2:13:30](https://youtu.be/3k6MBedWTww?t=8010) followers of Christ here what we have to  
[2:13:32](https://youtu.be/3k6MBedWTww?t=8012) reject Islam as well okay thank you now  
[2:13:38](https://youtu.be/3k6MBedWTww?t=8018) I've never made the claim that the  
[2:13:39](https://youtu.be/3k6MBedWTww?t=8019) Ebionites are the true followers of  
[2:13:40](https://youtu.be/3k6MBedWTww?t=8020) Christ that's something you have said  
[2:13:41](https://youtu.be/3k6MBedWTww?t=8021) that's not something I've said I've just  
[2:13:43](https://youtu.be/3k6MBedWTww?t=8023) made the point that they had the Islamic  
[2:13:45](https://youtu.be/3k6MBedWTww?t=8025) position on two aspects the non divinity  
[2:13:48](https://youtu.be/3k6MBedWTww?t=8028) of Jesus Christ and the non divinity of  
[2:13:49](https://youtu.be/3k6MBedWTww?t=8029) the Holy Spirit now they didn't have the  
[2:13:51](https://youtu.be/3k6MBedWTww?t=8031) Bible do you know why because they came  
[2:13:53](https://youtu.be/3k6MBedWTww?t=8033) before Jordan  
[2:13:54](https://youtu.be/3k6MBedWTww?t=8034) they came on 70 AD John came 95 AD  
[2:13:59](https://youtu.be/3k6MBedWTww?t=8039) [Applause]  
[2:14:01](https://youtu.be/3k6MBedWTww?t=8041) [Music]  
[2:14:02](https://youtu.be/3k6MBedWTww?t=8042) I don't know what to say they only had  
[2:14:04](https://youtu.be/3k6MBedWTww?t=8044) the Gospel of Matthew because only Mark  
[2:14:06](https://youtu.be/3k6MBedWTww?t=8046) Matthew and Luke the synoptic Gospels  
[2:14:08](https://youtu.be/3k6MBedWTww?t=8048) were available to them they had those

[2:14:42](https://youtu.be/3k6MBedWTww?t=8082) the Holy Spirit is absolutely null and  
[2:14:44](https://youtu.be/3k6MBedWTww?t=8084) void you know how many things in the

[2:15:20](https://youtu.be/3k6MBedWTww?t=8120) left okay as it relates to the Holy  
[2:15:23](https://youtu.be/3k6MBedWTww?t=8123) Spirit gregory of nazianzus and gregory  
[2:15:25](https://youtu.be/3k6MBedWTww?t=8125) of nyssa they throw in church documents  
[2:15:28](https://youtu.be/3k6MBedWTww?t=8128) primary source materials you can check  
[2:15:29](https://youtu.be/3k6MBedWTww?t=8129) the website many prophets one message it  
[2:15:31](https://youtu.be/3k6MBedWTww?t=8131) has all the references they quote we  
[2:15:33](https://youtu.be/3k6MBedWTww?t=8133) didn't know people were disputing about  
[2:15:35](https://youtu.be/3k6MBedWTww?t=8135) what the Holy Spirit is some said it was  
[2:15:37](https://youtu.be/3k6MBedWTww?t=8137) a creature some said it was God  
[2:15:39](https://youtu.be/3k6MBedWTww?t=8139) some said was this some said it was that  
[2:15:40](https://youtu.be/3k6MBedWTww?t=8140) we did not know that's what they said  
[2:15:42](https://youtu.be/3k6MBedWTww?t=8142) it's not an argument from Silence I'm  
[2:15:44](https://youtu.be/3k6MBedWTww?t=8144) making it's an argument from evidence  
[2:15:51](https://youtu.be/3k6MBedWTww?t=8151) thank you very much my job  
[2:15:55](https://youtu.be/3k6MBedWTww?t=8155) dr. wood you may start your five minute  
[2:15:57](https://youtu.be/3k6MBedWTww?t=8157) conclusion or switching  
[2:16:12](https://youtu.be/3k6MBedWTww?t=8172) well thank you thank you again a couple  
[2:16:15](https://youtu.be/3k6MBedWTww?t=8175) side notes here who says the Ebionites  
[2:16:17](https://youtu.be/3k6MBedWTww?t=8177) were too early our earliest reference to  
[2:16:19](https://youtu.be/3k6MBedWTww?t=8179) the EB Knights was from 140 of course  
[2:16:23](https://youtu.be/3k6MBedWTww?t=8183) they they they could be earlier but the  
[2:16:25](https://youtu.be/3k6MBedWTww?t=8185) point is these were people who had one  
[2:16:28](https://youtu.be/3k6MBedWTww?t=8188) part of one gospel and there were  
[2:16:32](https://youtu.be/3k6MBedWTww?t=8192) certainly there were certainly the rest  
[2:16:33](https://youtu.be/3k6MBedWTww?t=8193) of the Gospels around during the time  
[2:16:36](https://youtu.be/3k6MBedWTww?t=8196) but they are they're regarded as a  
[2:16:38](https://youtu.be/3k6MBedWTww?t=8198) radical offshoot of Judaism so to lay  
[2:16:42](https://youtu.be/3k6MBedWTww?t=8202) them down as authoritative again these  
[2:16:44](https://youtu.be/3k6MBedWTww?t=8204) are these are guys who didn't believe  
[2:16:45](https://youtu.be/3k6MBedWTww?t=8205) that prophets spoke from God they didn't  
[2:16:47](https://youtu.be/3k6MBedWTww?t=8207) believe in the virgin birth and so on so  
[2:16:49](https://youtu.be/3k6MBedWTww?t=8209) these guys are the closest to the true  
[2:16:51](https://youtu.be/3k6MBedWTww?t=8211) Jesus then we have to reject the Islamic  
[2:16:54](https://youtu.be/3k6MBedWTww?t=8214) Jesus they said no kids it echoes  
[2:16:56](https://youtu.be/3k6MBedWTww?t=8216) eternal now you have to understand what  
[2:16:57](https://youtu.be/3k6MBedWTww?t=8217) what the author of Hebrews is doing  
[2:17:00](https://youtu.be/3k6MBedWTww?t=8220) there he's talking about the  
[2:17:01](https://youtu.be/3k6MBedWTww?t=8221) descriptions right we don't have really  
[2:17:04](https://youtu.be/3k6MBedWTww?t=8224) time to go into this if someone wants to  
[2:17:06](https://youtu.be/3k6MBedWTww?t=8226) bring it up in the Q&A ask about  
[2:17:07](https://youtu.be/3k6MBedWTww?t=8227) Melchizedek when we can actually go what  
[2:17:09](https://youtu.be/3k6MBedWTww?t=8229) he's doing it he was not saying that  
[2:17:10](https://youtu.be/3k6MBedWTww?t=8230) Melchizedek milk acidic is eternal  
[2:17:13](https://youtu.be/3k6MBedWTww?t=8233) certainly not claiming that so and the  
[2:17:18](https://youtu.be/3k6MBedWTww?t=8238) last point just because something is  
[2:17:20](https://youtu.be/3k6MBedWTww?t=8240) called a God in Scripture doesn't mean  
[2:17:22](https://youtu.be/3k6MBedWTww?t=8242) it's a you know it has divine attributes  
[2:17:25](https://youtu.be/3k6MBedWTww?t=8245) as not God yes we understand the term  
[2:17:27](https://youtu.be/3k6MBedWTww?t=8247) they us in the the term Elohim and the  
[2:17:29](https://youtu.be/3k6MBedWTww?t=8249) Old Testament can mean various things  
[2:17:31](https://youtu.be/3k6MBedWTww?t=8251) the question is how are these terms used  
[2:17:33](https://youtu.be/3k6MBedWTww?t=8253) of Jesus how are these terms used of the  
[2:17:36](https://youtu.be/3k6MBedWTww?t=8256) Father how are these terms used of the  
[2:17:39](https://youtu.be/3k6MBedWTww?t=8259) Holy Spirit the Holy Spirit is creating  
[2:17:41](https://youtu.be/3k6MBedWTww?t=8261) the world in the Bible the Holy Spirit  
[2:17:44](https://youtu.be/3k6MBedWTww?t=8264) is eternal in the Bible so they just  
[2:17:47](https://youtu.be/3k6MBedWTww?t=8267) brush that off and say one of the things  
[2:17:48](https://youtu.be/3k6MBedWTww?t=8268) are called gut yeah not in the same not  
[2:17:51](https://youtu.be/3k6MBedWTww?t=8271) in that way right you could say oh those  
[2:17:52](https://youtu.be/3k6MBedWTww?t=8272) are false gods they're you're calling  
[2:17:54](https://youtu.be/3k6MBedWTww?t=8274) them you're saying they're their gods in  
[2:17:56](https://youtu.be/3k6MBedWTww?t=8276) some way you're using the term but  
[2:17:58](https://youtu.be/3k6MBedWTww?t=8278) you're not applying it seriously when we  
[2:18:01](https://youtu.be/3k6MBedWTww?t=8281) have Father Son and Holy Spirit these  
[2:18:03](https://youtu.be/3k6MBedWTww?t=8283) are used seriously of Father Son and  
[2:18:08](https://youtu.be/3k6MBedWTww?t=8288) Holy Spirit so as far as what we have  
[2:18:11](https://youtu.be/3k6MBedWTww?t=8291) what we have tonight again we see in the  
[2:18:15](https://youtu.be/3k6MBedWTww?t=8295) Old Testament we see from the opening  
[2:18:18](https://youtu.be/3k6MBedWTww?t=8298) verses of the book of Genesis and  
[2:18:19](https://youtu.be/3k6MBedWTww?t=8299) throughout the Old Testament various  
[2:18:22](https://youtu.be/3k6MBedWTww?t=8302) claims of plural  
[2:18:24](https://youtu.be/3k6MBedWTww?t=8304) within the one god Jewish commentators  
[2:18:28](https://youtu.be/3k6MBedWTww?t=8308) have mentioned this modern experts in  
[2:18:33](https://youtu.be/3k6MBedWTww?t=8313) Judaism acknowledged that prior to the  
[2:18:36](https://youtu.be/3k6MBedWTww?t=8316) end of the second century where the  
[2:18:39](https://youtu.be/3k6MBedWTww?t=8319) Jewish community swung very hardly in a  
[2:18:42](https://youtu.be/3k6MBedWTww?t=8322) Unitarian direction there was widespread  
[2:18:45](https://youtu.be/3k6MBedWTww?t=8325) agreement in the Jewish community and  
[2:18:47](https://youtu.be/3k6MBedWTww?t=8327) Muhammad had job how did he respond well  
[2:18:49](https://youtu.be/3k6MBedWTww?t=8329) show me where they say co-equal Co  
[2:18:51](https://youtu.be/3k6MBedWTww?t=8331) eternal father son holy snow one's  
[2:18:54](https://youtu.be/3k6MBedWTww?t=8334) claiming they knew that the point was  
[2:18:56](https://youtu.be/3k6MBedWTww?t=8336) you think they had this how he dish  
[2:18:59](https://youtu.be/3k6MBedWTww?t=8339) belief and they just didn't write what  
[2:19:02](https://youtu.be/3k6MBedWTww?t=8342) did what did the scholar say and what do  
[2:19:03](https://youtu.be/3k6MBedWTww?t=8343) various Jewish scholars say that's the  
[2:19:06](https://youtu.be/3k6MBedWTww?t=8346) doctrine that Christians believe in  
[2:19:07](https://youtu.be/3k6MBedWTww?t=8347) would have fit in very comfortably with  
[2:19:09](https://youtu.be/3k6MBedWTww?t=8349) what Jews prior to the second century at  
[2:19:12](https://youtu.be/3k6MBedWTww?t=8352) Finan there would have been nothing  
[2:19:13](https://youtu.be/3k6MBedWTww?t=8353) therefore for a Jew to claim about to  
[2:19:16](https://youtu.be/3k6MBedWTww?t=8356) complain about in terms of theology they  
[2:19:18](https://youtu.be/3k6MBedWTww?t=8358) would reject they wouldn't reject it by  
[2:19:19](https://youtu.be/3k6MBedWTww?t=8359) saying oh that's a confusing doctrine of  
[2:19:21](https://youtu.be/3k6MBedWTww?t=8361) God is the point they say we reject  
[2:19:23](https://youtu.be/3k6MBedWTww?t=8363) Jesus as the Messiah that would be the  
[2:19:25](https://youtu.be/3k6MBedWTww?t=8365) main complaints of Jews during the time  
[2:19:30](https://youtu.be/3k6MBedWTww?t=8370) and what have we seen on the other side  
[2:19:32](https://youtu.be/3k6MBedWTww?t=8372) right and here's what's interesting  
[2:19:34](https://youtu.be/3k6MBedWTww?t=8374) Christians have a lot of data right we  
[2:19:38](https://youtu.be/3k6MBedWTww?t=8378) have the Old Testament passages we have  
[2:19:40](https://youtu.be/3k6MBedWTww?t=8380) Jesus coming into the world and we see  
[2:19:43](https://youtu.be/3k6MBedWTww?t=8383) the various things that Jesus did and  
[2:19:45](https://youtu.be/3k6MBedWTww?t=8385) the claims he made and since he rises  
[2:19:47](https://youtu.be/3k6MBedWTww?t=8387) from the dead we have to take those  
[2:19:48](https://youtu.be/3k6MBedWTww?t=8388) claims seriously so when he's claiming  
[2:19:49](https://youtu.be/3k6MBedWTww?t=8389) to be the final judge of all mankind  
[2:19:51](https://youtu.be/3k6MBedWTww?t=8391) when he's claiming to be the one who  
[2:19:54](https://youtu.be/3k6MBedWTww?t=8394) raises the dead at the resurrection we  
[2:19:57](https://youtu.be/3k6MBedWTww?t=8397) recognize the kinds of claims that he's  
[2:19:59](https://youtu.be/3k6MBedWTww?t=8399) making and then when we find various  
[2:20:01](https://youtu.be/3k6MBedWTww?t=8401) claims about the Holy Spirit we take  
[2:20:02](https://youtu.be/3k6MBedWTww?t=8402) those seriously and we say all right  
[2:20:03](https://youtu.be/3k6MBedWTww?t=8403) everything that God has revealed to us  
[2:20:05](https://youtu.be/3k6MBedWTww?t=8405) we have to take seriously and the only  
[2:20:09](https://youtu.be/3k6MBedWTww?t=8409) way to take it all seriously is with  
[2:20:10](https://youtu.be/3k6MBedWTww?t=8410) something like the doctrine of the  
[2:20:11](https://youtu.be/3k6MBedWTww?t=8411) Trinity one minute left  
[2:20:13](https://youtu.be/3k6MBedWTww?t=8413) we turn to Islam and we find all kinds  
[2:20:17](https://youtu.be/3k6MBedWTww?t=8417) of things that are just confusing right  
[2:20:19](https://youtu.be/3k6MBedWTww?t=8419) you know I talk about Allah praying and  
[2:20:22](https://youtu.be/3k6MBedWTww?t=8422) it means sending blessings there  
[2:20:23](https://youtu.be/3k6MBedWTww?t=8423) perfectly you say Baraka right we know  
[2:20:27](https://youtu.be/3k6MBedWTww?t=8427) how to say that why does he use the word  
[2:20:29](https://youtu.be/3k6MBedWTww?t=8429) that's prayer so much so confusing so  
[2:20:31](https://youtu.be/3k6MBedWTww?t=8431) confusing that even Muslim translators  
[2:20:33](https://youtu.be/3k6MBedWTww?t=8433) are now translating it as Allah pray  
[2:20:36](https://youtu.be/3k6MBedWTww?t=8436) of different circumstances a lot praying  
[2:20:37](https://youtu.be/3k6MBedWTww?t=8437) for self-control so that his mercy can  
[2:20:39](https://youtu.be/3k6MBedWTww?t=8439) triumph over his wrath and we find this  
[2:20:41](https://youtu.be/3k6MBedWTww?t=8441) over and over again that you have an  
[2:20:43](https://youtu.be/3k6MBedWTww?t=8443) eternal word that there is a spirit that  
[2:20:46](https://youtu.be/3k6MBedWTww?t=8446) proceeds from within Allah that you have  
[2:20:49](https://youtu.be/3k6MBedWTww?t=8449) a man that his followers were we're  
[2:20:52](https://youtu.be/3k6MBedWTww?t=8452) drinking his blood all of these things  
[2:20:54](https://youtu.be/3k6MBedWTww?t=8454) if we said again goddesses are  
[2:20:57](https://youtu.be/3k6MBedWTww?t=8457) interceding with you with a lot you  
[2:20:59](https://youtu.be/3k6MBedWTww?t=8459) would say polytheism but the quran is  
[2:21:00](https://youtu.be/3k6MBedWTww?t=8460) doing in the form of birds who know  
[2:21:02](https://youtu.be/3k6MBedWTww?t=8462) things who talk and it's pure monotony  
[2:21:04](https://youtu.be/3k6MBedWTww?t=8464) seconds left and so when we see this  
[2:21:06](https://youtu.be/3k6MBedWTww?t=8466) over and over again islam looks like  
[2:21:09](https://youtu.be/3k6MBedWTww?t=8469) it's trying to copy christianity but  
[2:21:12](https://youtu.be/3k6MBedWTww?t=8472) just doing a really bad job of it thank  
[2:21:16](https://youtu.be/3k6MBedWTww?t=8476) you very much dr. word five minutes  
[2:21:24](https://youtu.be/3k6MBedWTww?t=8484) never would has been more interested or  
[2:21:27](https://youtu.be/3k6MBedWTww?t=8487) more concerned with trying to disprove  
[2:21:29](https://youtu.be/3k6MBedWTww?t=8489) islam today than defending christianity  
[2:21:33](https://youtu.be/3k6MBedWTww?t=8493) he talks about the indian accent as  
[2:21:35](https://youtu.be/3k6MBedWTww?t=8495) being a radical offshoot this is a a  
[2:21:38](https://youtu.be/3k6MBedWTww?t=8498) historic way of rendering history one  
[2:21:40](https://youtu.be/3k6MBedWTww?t=8500) man's Orthodox is another man's heresy  
[2:21:43](https://youtu.be/3k6MBedWTww?t=8503) gospel Gospels he says in one other time  
[2:21:45](https://youtu.be/3k6MBedWTww?t=8505) he says the Gospels were not present at  
[2:21:47](https://youtu.be/3k6MBedWTww?t=8507) the time of the church father this is a  
[2:21:48](https://youtu.be/3k6MBedWTww?t=8508) liar I missed reading one  
[2:21:50](https://youtu.be/3k6MBedWTww?t=8510) misunderstanding you should be reading  
[2:21:51](https://youtu.be/3k6MBedWTww?t=8511) his primary source materials almost all  
[2:21:53](https://youtu.be/3k6MBedWTww?t=8513) of them refer to the four Gospels all of  
[2:21:55](https://youtu.be/3k6MBedWTww?t=8515) the major Church Fathers referred to the  
[2:21:57](https://youtu.be/3k6MBedWTww?t=8517) four Gospels let's say from Justin  
[2:21:59](https://youtu.be/3k6MBedWTww?t=8519) Martyr onwards 100% this is something  
[2:22:01](https://youtu.be/3k6MBedWTww?t=8521) well-known look at their works  
[2:22:03](https://youtu.be/3k6MBedWTww?t=8523) Athanasius he's the one who make it a  
[2:22:06](https://youtu.be/3k6MBedWTww?t=8526) short list of what is going to be the  
[2:22:08](https://youtu.be/3k6MBedWTww?t=8528) Bible right he made a short list in mid  
[2:22:10](https://youtu.be/3k6MBedWTww?t=8530) 4th century the 27 books of the Old  
[2:22:13](https://youtu.be/3k6MBedWTww?t=8533) Testament now the question we could ask  
[2:22:15](https://youtu.be/3k6MBedWTww?t=8535) is who gave him the authority to do that  
[2:22:16](https://youtu.be/3k6MBedWTww?t=8536) to include in God's Word to take out of  
[2:22:19](https://youtu.be/3k6MBedWTww?t=8539) God's Word this is God's Word this is  
[2:22:21](https://youtu.be/3k6MBedWTww?t=8541) not good why is the Gospel of Thomas not  
[2:22:22](https://youtu.be/3k6MBedWTww?t=8542) in the Bible why is it he's making the  
[2:22:24](https://youtu.be/3k6MBedWTww?t=8544) decision it then became quite popular  
[2:22:26](https://youtu.be/3k6MBedWTww?t=8546) and it was an organic thing it wasn't in  
[2:22:28](https://youtu.be/3k6MBedWTww?t=8548) the council that these are the 27 books  
[2:22:29](https://youtu.be/3k6MBedWTww?t=8549) of the Old Testament that's another  
[2:22:31](https://youtu.be/3k6MBedWTww?t=8551) issue when we talk about the Bible what  
[2:22:33](https://youtu.be/3k6MBedWTww?t=8553) are we really talking about there's  
[2:22:35](https://youtu.be/3k6MBedWTww?t=8555) issues with the Bible there is no chain  
[2:22:38](https://youtu.be/3k6MBedWTww?t=8558) going back to Jesus everything that we  
[2:22:40](https://youtu.be/3k6MBedWTww?t=8560) have called a sorry hadith an authentic  
[2:22:42](https://youtu.be/3k6MBedWTww?t=8562) hadith has a chain going back to Prophet  
[2:22:44](https://youtu.be/3k6MBedWTww?t=8564) Muhammad or Allah  
[2:22:46](https://youtu.be/3k6MBedWTww?t=8566) and that's what you don't have and  
[2:22:47](https://youtu.be/3k6MBedWTww?t=8567) that's why our books are preserved and  
[2:22:48](https://youtu.be/3k6MBedWTww?t=8568) yours are not that's another issue he  
[2:22:54](https://youtu.be/3k6MBedWTww?t=8574) says he believes in progressive  
[2:22:55](https://youtu.be/3k6MBedWTww?t=8575) revelation in the Oh in the New  
[2:22:58](https://youtu.be/3k6MBedWTww?t=8578) Testament or light that's very good you  
[2:23:01](https://youtu.be/3k6MBedWTww?t=8581) know why because I agree with him on  
[2:23:02](https://youtu.be/3k6MBedWTww?t=8582) this point I want to end with this I  
[2:23:04](https://youtu.be/3k6MBedWTww?t=8584) agree with him  
[2:23:04](https://youtu.be/3k6MBedWTww?t=8584) I believe he's right yes the bible does  
[2:23:07](https://youtu.be/3k6MBedWTww?t=8587) talk about a progressive revelation  
[2:23:08](https://youtu.be/3k6MBedWTww?t=8588) which is why it talks about the upcoming  
[2:23:12](https://youtu.be/3k6MBedWTww?t=8592) prophet and that's why if you read  
[2:23:19](https://youtu.be/3k6MBedWTww?t=8599) isaiah 42 ask answer me this  
[2:23:23](https://youtu.be/3k6MBedWTww?t=8603) who in history has come to the kada  
[2:23:25](https://youtu.be/3k6MBedWTww?t=8605) right there arabs has made the people of  
[2:23:29](https://youtu.be/3k6MBedWTww?t=8609) Celle the mountaintops rejoice who in  
[2:23:32](https://youtu.be/3k6MBedWTww?t=8612) history went to the Arabs and made the  
[2:23:34](https://youtu.be/3k6MBedWTww?t=8614) Arabs rejoice defeating his enemies in  
[2:23:37](https://youtu.be/3k6MBedWTww?t=8617) military warfare and this is not  
[2:23:39](https://youtu.be/3k6MBedWTww?t=8619) something we're shy about by the way  
[2:23:40](https://youtu.be/3k6MBedWTww?t=8620) this is something we're very proud of  
[2:23:41](https://youtu.be/3k6MBedWTww?t=8621) very proud of this is something we're  
[2:23:47](https://youtu.be/3k6MBedWTww?t=8627) very proud of because our prophet is a  
[2:23:50](https://youtu.be/3k6MBedWTww?t=8630) winner and military winner it's part of  
[2:23:53](https://youtu.be/3k6MBedWTww?t=8633) his prophecy that he was going to do  
[2:23:54](https://youtu.be/3k6MBedWTww?t=8634) that  
[2:23:55](https://youtu.be/3k6MBedWTww?t=8635) that's what Deuteronomy chapter 18 says  
[2:23:56](https://youtu.be/3k6MBedWTww?t=8636) that there was going to be one of the  
[2:23:58](https://youtu.be/3k6MBedWTww?t=8638) ways to tell a true prophet is through  
[2:23:59](https://youtu.be/3k6MBedWTww?t=8639) prophecy every single one of the  
[2:24:01](https://youtu.be/3k6MBedWTww?t=8641) prophets Muhammad's prophecies came true  
[2:24:02](https://youtu.be/3k6MBedWTww?t=8642) look at the Quran it's a way that a  
[2:24:05](https://youtu.be/3k6MBedWTww?t=8645) Christian an honest Christian could come  
[2:24:08](https://youtu.be/3k6MBedWTww?t=8648) to terms who is this man prophet  
[2:24:10](https://youtu.be/3k6MBedWTww?t=8650) mohammed salah salem do the research  
[2:24:11](https://youtu.be/3k6MBedWTww?t=8651) right he's right there is progressive  
[2:24:13](https://youtu.be/3k6MBedWTww?t=8653) revelation but did not end with jesus it  
[2:24:16](https://youtu.be/3k6MBedWTww?t=8656) continued to prefer muhammad sallallahu  
[2:24:18](https://youtu.be/3k6MBedWTww?t=8658) alayhi wa sallam  
[2:24:22](https://youtu.be/3k6MBedWTww?t=8662) and that is why in the Quran it doesn't  
[2:24:26](https://youtu.be/3k6MBedWTww?t=8666) mention progressive revelation  
[2:24:27](https://youtu.be/3k6MBedWTww?t=8667) heartening the being is the final  
[2:24:29](https://youtu.be/3k6MBedWTww?t=8669) prophet if you really want salvation  
[2:24:31](https://youtu.be/3k6MBedWTww?t=8671) what lie he all that said and done 20  
[2:24:34](https://youtu.be/3k6MBedWTww?t=8674) years of attacking Islam documentaries

[2:29:17](https://youtu.be/3k6MBedWTww?t=8957) was the fact that Muslim scholars claim  
[2:29:19](https://youtu.be/3k6MBedWTww?t=8959) that companions during the prophets  
[2:29:21](https://youtu.be/3k6MBedWTww?t=8961) blood with your level of intellect I

[2:29:30](https://youtu.be/3k6MBedWTww?t=8970) which is Wallen haraam or forbidden to

[2:31:20](https://youtu.be/3k6MBedWTww?t=9080) comes out of the prophets so that none  
[2:31:21](https://youtu.be/3k6MBedWTww?t=9081) of it is seen although this tradition is  
[2:31:24](https://youtu.be/3k6MBedWTww?t=9084) not famous the people of knowledge still  
[2:31:27](https://youtu.be/3k6MBedWTww?t=9087) notice the people of knowledge still  
[2:31:29](https://youtu.be/3k6MBedWTww?t=9089) mentioned the purity of his feces and  
[2:31:31](https://youtu.be/3k6MBedWTww?t=9091) urine there was also the time when Malik  
[2:31:33](https://youtu.be/3k6MBedWTww?t=9093) Hibbins and n drank his blood on the day  
[2:31:36](https://youtu.be/3k6MBedWTww?t=9096) of a hood and licked it up the Prophet  
[2:31:38](https://youtu.be/3k6MBedWTww?t=9098) allowed him to do that and said the fire  
[2:31:41](https://youtu.be/3k6MBedWTww?t=9101) will not touch you so this is pages 35

[2:32:07](https://youtu.be/3k6MBedWTww?t=9127) cops of night scene there was nothing

[2:32:26](https://youtu.be/3k6MBedWTww?t=9146) Islam because there was no apostolate  
[2:32:28](https://youtu.be/3k6MBedWTww?t=9148) succession for Islam either so it was  
[2:32:31](https://youtu.be/3k6MBedWTww?t=9151) the exact ly what he's saying can you

[2:33:14](https://youtu.be/3k6MBedWTww?t=9194) the apostolate succession between the  
[2:33:16](https://youtu.be/3k6MBedWTww?t=9196) Trinity Trinity there was nothing  
[2:33:18](https://youtu.be/3k6MBedWTww?t=9198) mentioned by the church fathers between  
[2:33:20](https://youtu.be/3k6MBedWTww?t=9200) Jesus's crucifixion and the council  
[2:33:23](https://youtu.be/3k6MBedWTww?t=9203) might may seem can you mention one  
[2:33:27](https://youtu.be/3k6MBedWTww?t=9207) person historically who has talked about  
[2:33:29](https://youtu.be/3k6MBedWTww?t=9209) the massive succession of Islam between  
[2:33:32](https://youtu.be/3k6MBedWTww?t=9212) 33 AD and 583 AD when your prophet began  
[2:33:37](https://youtu.be/3k6MBedWTww?t=9217) when my prophet began sorry what I don't  
[2:33:41](https://youtu.be/3k6MBedWTww?t=9221) get it sorry what would you think he's  
[2:33:42](https://youtu.be/3k6MBedWTww?t=9222) basically asking for a reference from 33  
[2:33:45](https://youtu.be/3k6MBedWTww?t=9225) 82 583 to 5 over 3 well is it was  
[2:33:48](https://youtu.be/3k6MBedWTww?t=9228) mentioned that the prophecy Islam was  
[2:33:50](https://youtu.be/3k6MBedWTww?t=9230) coming what sorry guys I'm really I'm  
[2:33:54](https://youtu.be/3k6MBedWTww?t=9234) not doing it on purpose the source were  
[2:33:57](https://youtu.be/3k6MBedWTww?t=9237) or any-any  
[2:33:59](https://youtu.be/3k6MBedWTww?t=9239) is you're talking about Islam or  
[2:34:00](https://youtu.be/3k6MBedWTww?t=9240) Christianity he's talking about Islam  
[2:34:01](https://youtu.be/3k6MBedWTww?t=9241) okay 33 8 D so if they did not ask me I  
[2:34:04](https://youtu.be/3k6MBedWTww?t=9244) know I know he says it was there  
[2:34:06](https://youtu.be/3k6MBedWTww?t=9246) referenced it's not something to portray  
[2:34:08](https://youtu.be/3k6MBedWTww?t=9248) that would say that Islam is coming okay  
[2:34:11](https://youtu.be/3k6MBedWTww?t=9251) it's landing submission there's a  
[2:34:13](https://youtu.be/3k6MBedWTww?t=9253) reference to that in the Bible John  
[2:34:14](https://youtu.be/3k6MBedWTww?t=9254) chapter 5 verse 30 because it says I  
[2:34:16](https://youtu.be/3k6MBedWTww?t=9256) don't submit myself to my own will but  
[2:34:18](https://youtu.be/3k6MBedWTww?t=9258) to the will of the father that is Islam  
[2:34:19](https://youtu.be/3k6MBedWTww?t=9259) linguistically that's what Islam means  
[2:34:21](https://youtu.be/3k6MBedWTww?t=9261) so that's in the Bible we don't need to  
[2:34:23](https://youtu.be/3k6MBedWTww?t=9263) go to 33 AD  
[2:34:24](https://youtu.be/3k6MBedWTww?t=9264) is out it's alright I mean is that a  
[2:34:28](https://youtu.be/3k6MBedWTww?t=9268) question yeah yeah sorry one more view  
[2:34:32](https://youtu.be/3k6MBedWTww?t=9272) one more time I'm not understanding a  
[2:34:33](https://youtu.be/3k6MBedWTww?t=9273) question you're saying that there's  
[2:34:35](https://youtu.be/3k6MBedWTww?t=9275) there's nothing about the Trinity  
[2:34:36](https://youtu.be/3k6MBedWTww?t=9276) between 33 AD and about the time of the  
[2:34:38](https://youtu.be/3k6MBedWTww?t=9278) Council of Nicaea this is this is talks  
[2:34:40](https://youtu.be/3k6MBedWTww?t=9280) of your argument Oh  
[2:34:42](https://youtu.be/3k6MBedWTww?t=9282) the things you said the most yet but by  
[2:34:44](https://youtu.be/3k6MBedWTww?t=9284) that same definition we have nothing  
[2:34:46](https://youtu.be/3k6MBedWTww?t=9286) between 3380 that speaks anything about  
[2:34:48](https://youtu.be/3k6MBedWTww?t=9288) anything what not anything in the crowd  
[2:34:49](https://youtu.be/3k6MBedWTww?t=9289) but most of the things in the crop or  
[2:34:51](https://youtu.be/3k6MBedWTww?t=9291) Islam yes okay as Muslims we don't  
[2:34:57](https://youtu.be/3k6MBedWTww?t=9297) believe that the Quran was revealed to  
[2:35:00](https://youtu.be/3k6MBedWTww?t=9300) Jesus we believe it was revealed to  
[2:35:02](https://youtu.be/3k6MBedWTww?t=9302) Prophet Muhammad right so obviously the  
[2:35:04](https://youtu.be/3k6MBedWTww?t=9304) Quran because it was not revealed to  
[2:35:06](https://youtu.be/3k6MBedWTww?t=9306) Jesus it would be no reference to it  
[2:35:08](https://youtu.be/3k6MBedWTww?t=9308) because it was a final Testament that  
[2:35:09](https://youtu.be/3k6MBedWTww?t=9309) came afterwards you see so when I made  
[2:35:12](https://youtu.be/3k6MBedWTww?t=9312) my argument I wasn't I did not make the  
[2:35:14](https://youtu.be/3k6MBedWTww?t=9314) argument that the Trinity was not  
[2:35:15](https://youtu.be/3k6MBedWTww?t=9315) mentioned yeah the Trinity was mentioned  
[2:35:17](https://youtu.be/3k6MBedWTww?t=9317) by Tertullian I did I mentioned that I  
[2:35:19](https://youtu.be/3k6MBedWTww?t=9319) mentioned the Nicean Trinity of 381 and  
[2:35:23](https://youtu.be/3k6MBedWTww?t=9323) after that which stipulates very  
[2:35:26](https://youtu.be/3k6MBedWTww?t=9326) specific specific parameters as to what  
[2:35:28](https://youtu.be/3k6MBedWTww?t=9328) the Trinity is and what the Trinity  
[2:35:29](https://youtu.be/3k6MBedWTww?t=9329) isn't that was my argument yes so I  
[2:35:32](https://youtu.be/3k6MBedWTww?t=9332) didn't say the Trinity is not there in  
[2:35:34](https://youtu.be/3k6MBedWTww?t=9334) the first wave of 300 years I said then  
[2:35:36](https://youtu.be/3k6MBedWTww?t=9336) I see in Trinity wasn't there that's  
[2:35:38](https://youtu.be/3k6MBedWTww?t=9338) what it's that my my point was that if  
[2:35:41](https://youtu.be/3k6MBedWTww?t=9341) you don't believe that Jesus is divine  
[2:35:42](https://youtu.be/3k6MBedWTww?t=9342) you don't believe that the Holy Spirit  
[2:35:43](https://youtu.be/3k6MBedWTww?t=9343) is divine like many monarch in it  
[2:35:45](https://youtu.be/3k6MBedWTww?t=9345) morning artists and even eyes didn't  
[2:35:48](https://youtu.be/3k6MBedWTww?t=9348) believe then by definition you believe  
[2:35:50](https://youtu.be/3k6MBedWTww?t=9350) there's only one God worthy of worship  
[2:35:51](https://youtu.be/3k6MBedWTww?t=9351) right and if that if that's what you  
[2:35:54](https://youtu.be/3k6MBedWTww?t=9354) believe then you're a Muslim in a sense  
[2:35:55](https://youtu.be/3k6MBedWTww?t=9355) because you'll submit yourself to one  
[2:35:57](https://youtu.be/3k6MBedWTww?t=9357) God so from that perspective I think the  
[2:35:59](https://youtu.be/3k6MBedWTww?t=9359) case can be made thank you thank you one  
[2:36:06](https://youtu.be/3k6MBedWTww?t=9366) question over there for dr. wood all  
[2:36:09](https://youtu.be/3k6MBedWTww?t=9369) right so can you hear me properly dr.  
[2:36:11](https://youtu.be/3k6MBedWTww?t=9371) wood I just want to make sure a little  
[2:36:13](https://youtu.be/3k6MBedWTww?t=9373) bit all right I don't know if I'm in a  
[2:36:14](https://youtu.be/3k6MBedWTww?t=9374) bad spot that's the only mic I could  
[2:36:16](https://youtu.be/3k6MBedWTww?t=9376) hear really well just loud I might  
[2:36:18](https://youtu.be/3k6MBedWTww?t=9378) better now  
[2:36:21](https://youtu.be/3k6MBedWTww?t=9381) so my question is regarding the equality  
[2:36:24](https://youtu.be/3k6MBedWTww?t=9384) among the Trinity  
[2:36:25](https://youtu.be/3k6MBedWTww?t=9385) so in Matthew 28 verse 18 Jesus says  
[2:36:31](https://youtu.be/3k6MBedWTww?t=9391) that all authority is giving to him and  
[2:36:33](https://youtu.be/3k6MBedWTww?t=9393) on in the heavens and on earth and then  
[2:36:35](https://youtu.be/3k6MBedWTww?t=9395) in John chapter 16 verse 13 and states  
[2:36:40](https://youtu.be/3k6MBedWTww?t=9400) that but when the spirit of truth comes  
[2:36:42](https://youtu.be/3k6MBedWTww?t=9402) he will be he will guide you into all  
[2:36:44](https://youtu.be/3k6MBedWTww?t=9404) truth for he will not speak on his own  
[2:36:47](https://youtu.be/3k6MBedWTww?t=9407) authority but he will speak on what he  
[2:36:49](https://youtu.be/3k6MBedWTww?t=9409) hears so if the Holy Spirit is God why  
[2:36:52](https://youtu.be/3k6MBedWTww?t=9412) doesn't he have any authority to speak  
[2:36:54](https://youtu.be/3k6MBedWTww?t=9414) thank you if you look at if you look at  
[2:37:00](https://youtu.be/3k6MBedWTww?t=9420) how the Gospel of John is using these  
[2:37:05](https://youtu.be/3k6MBedWTww?t=9425) terms it's the the emphasis in these  
[2:37:08](https://youtu.be/3k6MBedWTww?t=9428) passages is not is not that the Holy  
[2:37:13](https://youtu.be/3k6MBedWTww?t=9433) Spirit is not God or that Jesus is not  
[2:37:17](https://youtu.be/3k6MBedWTww?t=9437) God he's trying to show that there they  
[2:37:21](https://youtu.be/3k6MBedWTww?t=9441) are one like in other words in John  
[2:37:24](https://youtu.be/3k6MBedWTww?t=9444) chapter 5 right Muslims love to bring up  
[2:37:26](https://youtu.be/3k6MBedWTww?t=9446) John chapter 5 where Jesus says of my  
[2:37:29](https://youtu.be/3k6MBedWTww?t=9449) own self I can do nothing check-check  
[2:37:30](https://youtu.be/3k6MBedWTww?t=9450) we're good sense of my own self I can do  
[2:37:33](https://youtu.be/3k6MBedWTww?t=9453) nothing they say aha right there which  
[2:37:35](https://youtu.be/3k6MBedWTww?t=9455) is parallel to the spirit doesn't speak  
[2:37:38](https://youtu.be/3k6MBedWTww?t=9458) on his own on his on his own authority  
[2:37:40](https://youtu.be/3k6MBedWTww?t=9460) right if you look at what's actually  
[2:37:41](https://youtu.be/3k6MBedWTww?t=9461) going on there at the beginning of John  
[2:37:44](https://youtu.be/3k6MBedWTww?t=9464) I mean earlier in John chapter 5 because  
[2:37:47](https://youtu.be/3k6MBedWTww?t=9467) Jesus is calling himself the Son and  
[2:37:50](https://youtu.be/3k6MBedWTww?t=9470) saying that he can work on the Sabbath  
[2:37:54](https://youtu.be/3k6MBedWTww?t=9474) because the father does notice Jews are  
[2:37:56](https://youtu.be/3k6MBedWTww?t=9476) not allowed to work on the Sabbath Jesus  
[2:37:58](https://youtu.be/3k6MBedWTww?t=9478) says but the Father works on the Sabbath  
[2:38:00](https://youtu.be/3k6MBedWTww?t=9480) and so do i right when he said that they  
[2:38:03](https://youtu.be/3k6MBedWTww?t=9483) accused him of claiming to be another  
[2:38:05](https://youtu.be/3k6MBedWTww?t=9485) God right he's a rogue deity right he's  
[2:38:08](https://youtu.be/3k6MBedWTww?t=9488) a separate so what he does there and the  
[2:38:13](https://youtu.be/3k6MBedWTww?t=9493) rest of John chapter 5 that's where he  
[2:38:15](https://youtu.be/3k6MBedWTww?t=9495) claims to that he's the one who raises  
[2:38:17](https://youtu.be/3k6MBedWTww?t=9497) the dead at the resurrection he says  
[2:38:19](https://youtu.be/3k6MBedWTww?t=9499) that he's the one who is the final judge  
[2:38:22](https://youtu.be/3k6MBedWTww?t=9502) and he says that we have to honor  
[2:38:26](https://youtu.be/3k6MBedWTww?t=9506) just as we honor the father right so  
[2:38:29](https://youtu.be/3k6MBedWTww?t=9509) keep in mind we have to you would only  
[2:38:32](https://youtu.be/3k6MBedWTww?t=9512) honor someone the same way you honor the  
[2:38:34](https://youtu.be/3k6MBedWTww?t=9514) father if he has the same nature nature  
[2:38:36](https://youtu.be/3k6MBedWTww?t=9516) and attributes as the father so when he  
[2:38:38](https://youtu.be/3k6MBedWTww?t=9518) says when he says that he can do nothing  
[2:38:40](https://youtu.be/3k6MBedWTww?t=9520) of himself or when the holy spirit does  
[2:38:42](https://youtu.be/3k6MBedWTww?t=9522) not not speak on his own authority what  
[2:38:45](https://youtu.be/3k6MBedWTww?t=9525) these are saying is they don't do these  
[2:38:48](https://youtu.be/3k6MBedWTww?t=9528) things separately as separate deities  
[2:38:51](https://youtu.be/3k6MBedWTww?t=9531) from the Father because that's the  
[2:38:53](https://youtu.be/3k6MBedWTww?t=9533) accusation as soon as you start saying  
[2:38:54](https://youtu.be/3k6MBedWTww?t=9534) some things are divine they start  
[2:38:56](https://youtu.be/3k6MBedWTww?t=9536) accusing of saying there's other gods so  
[2:38:58](https://youtu.be/3k6MBedWTww?t=9538) the emphasis is he doesn't do this on  
[2:38:59](https://youtu.be/3k6MBedWTww?t=9539) his own all right thank you very much  
[2:39:03](https://youtu.be/3k6MBedWTww?t=9543) dr. wood we're past the halfway mark  
[2:39:05](https://youtu.be/3k6MBedWTww?t=9545) right now and q8 so we're gonna try to  
[2:39:07](https://youtu.be/3k6MBedWTww?t=9547) speed it up as much as we cancel will  
[2:39:09](https://youtu.be/3k6MBedWTww?t=9549) limit each answer to one minute for both  
[2:39:12](https://youtu.be/3k6MBedWTww?t=9552) speakers so I think the next question is  
[2:39:15](https://youtu.be/3k6MBedWTww?t=9555) for mr. Jeff yes I have a question for  
[2:39:18](https://youtu.be/3k6MBedWTww?t=9558) mr. headshop I was wondering since the  
[2:39:20](https://youtu.be/3k6MBedWTww?t=9560) thrust of your argument hinges on  
[2:39:23](https://youtu.be/3k6MBedWTww?t=9563) David's inexpert flaw knowledge of  
[2:39:26](https://youtu.be/3k6MBedWTww?t=9566) Arabic don't you think it's a little odd  
[2:39:28](https://youtu.be/3k6MBedWTww?t=9568) that the will of God can only be  
[2:39:31](https://youtu.be/3k6MBedWTww?t=9571) discerned by people who speak in it so  
[2:39:34](https://youtu.be/3k6MBedWTww?t=9574) Tarek language spoken by less than 5% of  
[2:39:37](https://youtu.be/3k6MBedWTww?t=9577) the population and which has many  
[2:39:41](https://youtu.be/3k6MBedWTww?t=9581) dialects and isn't even spoken by the  
[2:39:44](https://youtu.be/3k6MBedWTww?t=9584) majority of self-professed Muslims and  
[2:39:47](https://youtu.be/3k6MBedWTww?t=9587) what do you think of the fact that there  
[2:39:49](https://youtu.be/3k6MBedWTww?t=9589) are people who are very learned in  
[2:39:51](https://youtu.be/3k6MBedWTww?t=9591) Arabic who even born in Arabia who have  
[2:39:53](https://youtu.be/3k6MBedWTww?t=9593) the same epistemological moro scientific  
[2:39:56](https://youtu.be/3k6MBedWTww?t=9596) and historical critiques of the quran  
[2:40:00](https://youtu.be/3k6MBedWTww?t=9600) thank you very much  
[2:40:02](https://youtu.be/3k6MBedWTww?t=9602) the question was about the Arabic  
[2:40:03](https://youtu.be/3k6MBedWTww?t=9603) language of the Quran and you were  
[2:40:05](https://youtu.be/3k6MBedWTww?t=9605) saying that is it is it the case that  
[2:40:07](https://youtu.be/3k6MBedWTww?t=9607) only Arabs can access the Quran in a  
[2:40:09](https://youtu.be/3k6MBedWTww?t=9609) nutshell is it why is it the only 5% of  
[2:40:11](https://youtu.be/3k6MBedWTww?t=9611) the population can access this and the  
[2:40:13](https://youtu.be/3k6MBedWTww?t=9613) rest cannot now there's a difference  
[2:40:15](https://youtu.be/3k6MBedWTww?t=9615) between understanding the fundamentals  
[2:40:17](https://youtu.be/3k6MBedWTww?t=9617) of a religion yes and trying to do  
[2:40:19](https://youtu.be/3k6MBedWTww?t=9619) exegesis yes exegesis is when you try  
[2:40:23](https://youtu.be/3k6MBedWTww?t=9623) hermeneutic ly to go into the text and  
[2:40:26](https://youtu.be/3k6MBedWTww?t=9626) understand it holistically and for that  
[2:40:30](https://youtu.be/3k6MBedWTww?t=9630) you require language ability for that  
[2:40:34](https://youtu.be/3k6MBedWTww?t=9634) you require whether you're doing with  
[2:40:35](https://youtu.be/3k6MBedWTww?t=9635) the Bible or the  
[2:40:36](https://youtu.be/3k6MBedWTww?t=9636) you require to have some kind of ability  
[2:40:38](https://youtu.be/3k6MBedWTww?t=9638) to understand the language otherwise  
[2:40:40](https://youtu.be/3k6MBedWTww?t=9640) your hermeneutic will be necessarily  
[2:40:42](https://youtu.be/3k6MBedWTww?t=9642) limited now just quickly as I do have a  
[2:40:45](https://youtu.be/3k6MBedWTww?t=9645) little bit of time answering the  
[2:40:47](https://youtu.be/3k6MBedWTww?t=9647) question or the point on on John that  
[2:40:50](https://youtu.be/3k6MBedWTww?t=9650) that David talked about don't John John  
[2:40:53](https://youtu.be/3k6MBedWTww?t=9653) chapter 10 verse 34 Jesus clearly says  
[2:40:56](https://youtu.be/3k6MBedWTww?t=9656) why did you call me God I mean they were  
[2:40:58](https://youtu.be/3k6MBedWTww?t=9658) about to stone him when he said this and  
[2:41:00](https://youtu.be/3k6MBedWTww?t=9660) he's really is referencing Psalms 82 so  
[2:41:03](https://youtu.be/3k6MBedWTww?t=9663) if you really believe he's God then why  
[2:41:04](https://youtu.be/3k6MBedWTww?t=9664) is he saying didn't didn't you say this  
[2:41:08](https://youtu.be/3k6MBedWTww?t=9668) of old like you are gods  
[2:41:10](https://youtu.be/3k6MBedWTww?t=9670) NUI are gods in other words it's a  
[2:41:13](https://youtu.be/3k6MBedWTww?t=9673) language of the people and that's one of  
[2:41:15](https://youtu.be/3k6MBedWTww?t=9675) the biggest problems serve them sorry  
[2:41:17](https://youtu.be/3k6MBedWTww?t=9677) I'm sorry  
[2:41:18](https://youtu.be/3k6MBedWTww?t=9678) apologies good you can go ahead question  
[2:41:22](https://youtu.be/3k6MBedWTww?t=9682) for dr. wood I have one question for you  
[2:41:28](https://youtu.be/3k6MBedWTww?t=9688) it has three co-equal parts but I assure  
[2:41:31](https://youtu.be/3k6MBedWTww?t=9691) you that it is just one question you try  
[2:41:32](https://youtu.be/3k6MBedWTww?t=9692) to keep it to one we're trying to get as  
[2:41:33](https://youtu.be/3k6MBedWTww?t=9693) much  
[2:41:35](https://youtu.be/3k6MBedWTww?t=9695) three is one  
[2:41:46](https://youtu.be/3k6MBedWTww?t=9706) can I ask it would you agree that the  
[2:41:51](https://youtu.be/3k6MBedWTww?t=9711) concept of the Trinity has evolved over  
[2:41:53](https://youtu.be/3k6MBedWTww?t=9713) time what do you say about Revelation  
[2:41:56](https://youtu.be/3k6MBedWTww?t=9716) chapter 22 verse 18 to 19 where it says  
[2:41:59](https://youtu.be/3k6MBedWTww?t=9719) I warn everyone who hears the word of  
[2:42:01](https://youtu.be/3k6MBedWTww?t=9721) the prophecy of this book if anyone adds  
[2:42:04](https://youtu.be/3k6MBedWTww?t=9724) to them God will add to him the plagues  
[2:42:07](https://youtu.be/3k6MBedWTww?t=9727) described in this book is etc etc etc  
[2:42:10](https://youtu.be/3k6MBedWTww?t=9730) and can you explain Matthew chapter 7  
[2:42:13](https://youtu.be/3k6MBedWTww?t=9733) verses 21 to 23 where Jesus says I never  
[2:42:16](https://youtu.be/3k6MBedWTww?t=9736) knew I never knew you get away from me  
[2:42:20](https://youtu.be/3k6MBedWTww?t=9740) well there he says not everyone who says  
[2:42:23](https://youtu.be/3k6MBedWTww?t=9743) not everyone who says to me Lord Lord  
[2:42:25](https://youtu.be/3k6MBedWTww?t=9745) will enter the kingdom of heaven but  
[2:42:28](https://youtu.be/3k6MBedWTww?t=9748) only those who do the will of my father  
[2:42:30](https://youtu.be/3k6MBedWTww?t=9750) so he will say I never knew you I don't  
[2:42:35](https://youtu.be/3k6MBedWTww?t=9755) understand what what the problem is  
[2:42:37](https://youtu.be/3k6MBedWTww?t=9757) there Jesus calls himself Lord but he's  
[2:42:39](https://youtu.be/3k6MBedWTww?t=9759) saying not even not you you don't just  
[2:42:40](https://youtu.be/3k6MBedWTww?t=9760) call him Lord and then and then you're  
[2:42:42](https://youtu.be/3k6MBedWTww?t=9762) fine moves the other party what do you  
[2:42:45](https://youtu.be/3k6MBedWTww?t=9765) would you agree that the concept of  
[2:42:48](https://youtu.be/3k6MBedWTww?t=9768) Trinity has evolved over time  
[2:42:49](https://youtu.be/3k6MBedWTww?t=9769) oh no the clarification of the concept  
[2:42:51](https://youtu.be/3k6MBedWTww?t=9771) right keep in mind whether you're  
[2:42:54](https://youtu.be/3k6MBedWTww?t=9774) talking about the Quran whether you're  
[2:42:55](https://youtu.be/3k6MBedWTww?t=9775) talking about the Bible  
[2:42:56](https://youtu.be/3k6MBedWTww?t=9776) you have historical events you have  
[2:42:59](https://youtu.be/3k6MBedWTww?t=9779) revelations from prophets statements and  
[2:43:02](https://youtu.be/3k6MBedWTww?t=9782) so on and if you're coming up with the  
[2:43:05](https://youtu.be/3k6MBedWTww?t=9785) Creed you're trying to clarify it you're  
[2:43:08](https://youtu.be/3k6MBedWTww?t=9788) trying to make it as concise as possible  
[2:43:09](https://youtu.be/3k6MBedWTww?t=9789) so yeah they had to cook they had to  
[2:43:13](https://youtu.be/3k6MBedWTww?t=9793) figure out how to say things in using  
[2:43:17](https://youtu.be/3k6MBedWTww?t=9797) certain terms in language but matryona  
[2:43:21](https://youtu.be/3k6MBedWTww?t=9801) God is eternal right the triune God is  
[2:43:23](https://youtu.be/3k6MBedWTww?t=9803) eternal our our descriptions our  
[2:43:26](https://youtu.be/3k6MBedWTww?t=9806) descriptions may take time but that's  
[2:43:28](https://youtu.be/3k6MBedWTww?t=9808) not it that's not the Trinity evolving  
[2:43:31](https://youtu.be/3k6MBedWTww?t=9811) that's our concepts being clarified and  
[2:43:33](https://youtu.be/3k6MBedWTww?t=9813) what about the third part where I said  
[2:43:35](https://youtu.be/3k6MBedWTww?t=9815) what do you say about revelation chapter  
[2:43:37](https://youtu.be/3k6MBedWTww?t=9817) 22 verse 18 to 19 where it says I want  
[2:43:40](https://youtu.be/3k6MBedWTww?t=9820) everyone who hears the words of the  
[2:43:42](https://youtu.be/3k6MBedWTww?t=9822) prophecy of this book if anyone adds to  
[2:43:44](https://youtu.be/3k6MBedWTww?t=9824) them God will add to him the plagues  
[2:43:47](https://youtu.be/3k6MBedWTww?t=9827) described in this book etc etc well the  
[2:43:49](https://youtu.be/3k6MBedWTww?t=9829) book of Revelation it the author I  
[2:43:52](https://youtu.be/3k6MBedWTww?t=9832) didn't know he's gonna be writing last  
[2:43:53](https://youtu.be/3k6MBedWTww?t=9833) book of the Bible he's talking about his  
[2:43:54](https://youtu.be/3k6MBedWTww?t=9834) prophecy his prophecy in book of  
[2:43:55](https://youtu.be/3k6MBedWTww?t=9835) Revelation don't take my prophecy and  
[2:43:57](https://youtu.be/3k6MBedWTww?t=9837) add a bunch of words to them so he's  
[2:43:59](https://youtu.be/3k6MBedWTww?t=9839) just saying hey don't add to my prophecy  
[2:44:00](https://youtu.be/3k6MBedWTww?t=9840) here and act like it's my prophecy that  
[2:44:03](https://youtu.be/3k6MBedWTww?t=9843) doesn't mean you can't clarify concepts  
[2:44:05](https://youtu.be/3k6MBedWTww?t=9845) right so thank you very much question  
[2:44:10](https://youtu.be/3k6MBedWTww?t=9850) for mr. hijab yes a question for mr.  
[2:44:13](https://youtu.be/3k6MBedWTww?t=9853) David I'm sorry I have question if I  
[2:44:15](https://youtu.be/3k6MBedWTww?t=9855) miss to work for mr. would would have to  
[2:44:19](https://youtu.be/3k6MBedWTww?t=9859) take questions on the surface at first  
[2:44:20](https://youtu.be/3k6MBedWTww?t=9860) anyone wants answer of course go ahead  
[2:44:22](https://youtu.be/3k6MBedWTww?t=9862) Louis up I had a question for you yes  
[2:44:26](https://youtu.be/3k6MBedWTww?t=9866) are you certain that you will be going  
[2:44:29](https://youtu.be/3k6MBedWTww?t=9869) to heaven Janna as according to Islam  
[2:44:33](https://youtu.be/3k6MBedWTww?t=9873) says you yourself no does that concern  
[2:44:37](https://youtu.be/3k6MBedWTww?t=9877) you maybe David will go to heaven and I  
[2:44:39](https://youtu.be/3k6MBedWTww?t=9879) will go to hell that's a possibility you  
[2:44:42](https://youtu.be/3k6MBedWTww?t=9882) know I mean I as a Muslim as a Muslim I  
[2:44:45](https://youtu.be/3k6MBedWTww?t=9885) can't guarantee and you know Christians  
[2:44:47](https://youtu.be/3k6MBedWTww?t=9887) say Christians say that you know God  
[2:44:50](https://youtu.be/3k6MBedWTww?t=9890) this is one of the arguments that you  
[2:44:51](https://youtu.be/3k6MBedWTww?t=9891) can't guarantee you it's off the kingdom  
[2:44:53](https://youtu.be/3k6MBedWTww?t=9893) of heaven yeah yeah that's true that's  
[2:44:55](https://youtu.be/3k6MBedWTww?t=9895) true that what why is that amount to the  
[2:44:57](https://youtu.be/3k6MBedWTww?t=9897) falsity of Islam I mean what logical  
[2:44:59](https://youtu.be/3k6MBedWTww?t=9899) reasoning is that anyways the point is  
[2:45:01](https://youtu.be/3k6MBedWTww?t=9901) say for instance you're a Christian and  
[2:45:03](https://youtu.be/3k6MBedWTww?t=9903) you believe that if you're a Christian  
[2:45:05](https://youtu.be/3k6MBedWTww?t=9905) you're going to go to heaven but even  
[2:45:06](https://youtu.be/3k6MBedWTww?t=9906) according to your own belief system  
[2:45:08](https://youtu.be/3k6MBedWTww?t=9908) there is a possibility a logical  
[2:45:10](https://youtu.be/3k6MBedWTww?t=9910) rational possibility that for instance  
[2:45:12](https://youtu.be/3k6MBedWTww?t=9912) you'll die upon Hinduism or atheism or  
[2:45:14](https://youtu.be/3k6MBedWTww?t=9914) do Judaism and in which case you will  
[2:45:16](https://youtu.be/3k6MBedWTww?t=9916) have to you have to conclude that you  
[2:45:18](https://youtu.be/3k6MBedWTww?t=9918) cannot be perfectly sure that you're  
[2:45:21](https://youtu.be/3k6MBedWTww?t=9921) going to heaven because that would mean  
[2:45:23](https://youtu.be/3k6MBedWTww?t=9923) that you have perfect knowledge of the  
[2:45:24](https://youtu.be/3k6MBedWTww?t=9924) future and not only do you not have that  
[2:45:27](https://youtu.be/3k6MBedWTww?t=9927) perfect knowledge nor not even the Holy  
[2:45:29](https://youtu.be/3k6MBedWTww?t=9929) Spirit had that knowledge oh thank you  
[2:45:31](https://youtu.be/3k6MBedWTww?t=9931) very much mr. head now  
[2:45:33](https://youtu.be/3k6MBedWTww?t=9933) you may ask your question for dr. wood  
[2:45:35](https://youtu.be/3k6MBedWTww?t=9935) are you like yeah he said in the  
[2:45:37](https://youtu.be/3k6MBedWTww?t=9937) beginning that God was in heaven and he  
[2:45:41](https://youtu.be/3k6MBedWTww?t=9941) was his the spirit was hovering of over  
[2:45:44](https://youtu.be/3k6MBedWTww?t=9944) the heaven and it was a mystery and the  
[2:45:46](https://youtu.be/3k6MBedWTww?t=9946) mystery was supposed to be revealed but  
[2:45:49](https://youtu.be/3k6MBedWTww?t=9949) it went on more into dark that mystery  
[2:45:52](https://youtu.be/3k6MBedWTww?t=9952) never got explained if I am if I'm  
[2:45:54](https://youtu.be/3k6MBedWTww?t=9954) pushed towards believing God to be a  
[2:45:56](https://youtu.be/3k6MBedWTww?t=9956) mystery it will be Hinduism when God  
[2:45:59](https://youtu.be/3k6MBedWTww?t=9959) comes through multiple incarnations to  
[2:46:01](https://youtu.be/3k6MBedWTww?t=9961) earth in order to fix people does that  
[2:46:05](https://youtu.be/3k6MBedWTww?t=9965) mean Christianity is a subset of  
[2:46:07](https://youtu.be/3k6MBedWTww?t=9967) Hinduism when he claims Jesus came as a  
[2:46:09](https://youtu.be/3k6MBedWTww?t=9969) incarnation of God  
[2:46:14](https://youtu.be/3k6MBedWTww?t=9974) [Music]  
[2:46:25](https://youtu.be/3k6MBedWTww?t=9985) if in Hinduism it is a common belief  
[2:46:28](https://youtu.be/3k6MBedWTww?t=9988) that God comes as incarnations and I  
[2:46:31](https://youtu.be/3k6MBedWTww?t=9991) suppose you also believe that Jesus came  
[2:46:35](https://youtu.be/3k6MBedWTww?t=9995) as incarnation of God onto the earth to  
[2:46:37](https://youtu.be/3k6MBedWTww?t=9997) fix people and to teach the variety does  
[2:46:41](https://youtu.be/3k6MBedWTww?t=10001) that mean in Christianity is a subset of  
[2:46:43](https://youtu.be/3k6MBedWTww?t=10003) Hinduism in terms of its beliefs no you  
[2:46:53](https://youtu.be/3k6MBedWTww?t=10013) can't say anyone who believes in an  
[2:46:54](https://youtu.be/3k6MBedWTww?t=10014) incarnation is a subset of Hinduism  
[2:46:58](https://youtu.be/3k6MBedWTww?t=10018) if someone who's never heard one single  
[2:47:00](https://youtu.be/3k6MBedWTww?t=10020) thing about Hinduism which would have  
[2:47:02](https://youtu.be/3k6MBedWTww?t=10022) been first century Jews believed in an  
[2:47:04](https://youtu.be/3k6MBedWTww?t=10024) incarnation has nothing has nothing to  
[2:47:07](https://youtu.be/3k6MBedWTww?t=10027) do with with Hinduism just because you  
[2:47:10](https://youtu.be/3k6MBedWTww?t=10030) have some sort of parallel in some way  
[2:47:15](https://youtu.be/3k6MBedWTww?t=10035) like oh but there are many religions  
[2:47:17](https://youtu.be/3k6MBedWTww?t=10037) that believe in rising from the dead  
[2:47:19](https://youtu.be/3k6MBedWTww?t=10039) doesn't mean they all stole it from each  
[2:47:20](https://youtu.be/3k6MBedWTww?t=10040) other so no  
[2:47:29](https://youtu.be/3k6MBedWTww?t=10049) right  
[2:47:33](https://youtu.be/3k6MBedWTww?t=10053) next question for mr. Hodge ah yeah oh  
[2:47:37](https://youtu.be/3k6MBedWTww?t=10057) yeah guys thank you for coming thanks  
[2:47:39](https://youtu.be/3k6MBedWTww?t=10059) Danika Mohammed and yeah so my question  
[2:47:42](https://youtu.be/3k6MBedWTww?t=10062) is like there's a question that Debbie  
[2:47:44](https://youtu.be/3k6MBedWTww?t=10064) dude asked about the fact that the Quran  
[2:47:46](https://youtu.be/3k6MBedWTww?t=10066) says that Bob sorry Oh  
[2:47:48](https://youtu.be/3k6MBedWTww?t=10068) the Quran says that the followers of  
[2:47:51](https://youtu.be/3k6MBedWTww?t=10071) Jesus was supposed to be uppermost and  
[2:47:54](https://youtu.be/3k6MBedWTww?t=10074) so like I was wondering what your  
[2:47:56](https://youtu.be/3k6MBedWTww?t=10076) understanding of that is because I  
[2:47:58](https://youtu.be/3k6MBedWTww?t=10078) thought that them being uppermost would  
[2:48:00](https://youtu.be/3k6MBedWTww?t=10080) be that they're the ones who are going  
[2:48:02](https://youtu.be/3k6MBedWTww?t=10082) to overcome over the disbelievers and so  
[2:48:05](https://youtu.be/3k6MBedWTww?t=10085) we obviously know that Chris the  
[2:48:07](https://youtu.be/3k6MBedWTww?t=10087) Christians who were there during  
[2:48:08](https://youtu.be/3k6MBedWTww?t=10088) Muhammad's time we lived in the Trinity  
[2:48:11](https://youtu.be/3k6MBedWTww?t=10091) and so like I was just wondering what  
[2:48:13](https://youtu.be/3k6MBedWTww?t=10093) happened to Jesus's disciples according  
[2:48:16](https://youtu.be/3k6MBedWTww?t=10096) to Islam and why did they why were they  
[2:48:19](https://youtu.be/3k6MBedWTww?t=10099) not able to counter the faults yes  
[2:48:21](https://youtu.be/3k6MBedWTww?t=10101) disciples well about this Virgil Idina  
[2:48:26](https://youtu.be/3k6MBedWTww?t=10106) Ibaka focal Idina kafir o Allah I am  
[2:48:28](https://youtu.be/3k6MBedWTww?t=10108) talking about the Howard Ian it says  
[2:48:31](https://youtu.be/3k6MBedWTww?t=10111) that we're going to make them higher  
[2:48:32](https://youtu.be/3k6MBedWTww?t=10112) than those who have disbelieved until  
[2:48:34](https://youtu.be/3k6MBedWTww?t=10114) the day of judgment yes so it's talking  
[2:48:37](https://youtu.be/3k6MBedWTww?t=10117) about the disciples of Jesus we believe  
[2:48:39](https://youtu.be/3k6MBedWTww?t=10119) that those early Christians were on the  
[2:48:42](https://youtu.be/3k6MBedWTww?t=10122) truth let me repeat the quran says very  
[2:48:45](https://youtu.be/3k6MBedWTww?t=10125) clearly that those Christians will go to  
[2:48:47](https://youtu.be/3k6MBedWTww?t=10127) heaven those Christians will go to  
[2:48:49](https://youtu.be/3k6MBedWTww?t=10129) heaven they believed in Christ they were  
[2:48:51](https://youtu.be/3k6MBedWTww?t=10131) followed Christ they believed in his law  
[2:48:53](https://youtu.be/3k6MBedWTww?t=10133) etc now there's a difference now as a  
[2:48:57](https://youtu.be/3k6MBedWTww?t=10137) point of demarcation between the early  
[2:48:59](https://youtu.be/3k6MBedWTww?t=10139) Christians the disciples and then the  
[2:49:02](https://youtu.be/3k6MBedWTww?t=10142) Church Fathers and then those who came  
[2:49:03](https://youtu.be/3k6MBedWTww?t=10143) up to those so the point is as Muslims  
[2:49:06](https://youtu.be/3k6MBedWTww?t=10146) our Creed is we believe Jesus was  
[2:49:08](https://youtu.be/3k6MBedWTww?t=10148) innocent of all of this that his  
[2:49:10](https://youtu.be/3k6MBedWTww?t=10150) followers were innocent of all of this  
[2:49:12](https://youtu.be/3k6MBedWTww?t=10152) and that he and that they are people who  
[2:49:15](https://youtu.be/3k6MBedWTww?t=10155) are honored in Islam and whoever says  
[2:49:16](https://youtu.be/3k6MBedWTww?t=10156) anything wrong about the disciples in  
[2:49:18](https://youtu.be/3k6MBedWTww?t=10158) Islam has left Islam because of  
[2:49:20](https://youtu.be/3k6MBedWTww?t=10160) something in Islam yeah  
[2:49:22](https://youtu.be/3k6MBedWTww?t=10162) which is very clear it's a clear point  
[2:49:25](https://youtu.be/3k6MBedWTww?t=10165) of our Peter for us yes if anyone of  
[2:49:27](https://youtu.be/3k6MBedWTww?t=10167) course is the the heroin the disciples  
[2:49:30](https://youtu.be/3k6MBedWTww?t=10170) this is Cooper because Allah he says

[2:49:45](https://youtu.be/3k6MBedWTww?t=10185) gone they are disbelievers as well so it  
[2:49:47](https://youtu.be/3k6MBedWTww?t=10187) can't be both ways can't be both thank  
[2:49:50](https://youtu.be/3k6MBedWTww?t=10190) you very much one question for dr. book  
[2:49:55](https://youtu.be/3k6MBedWTww?t=10195) before I begin David would said that the  
[2:49:58](https://youtu.be/3k6MBedWTww?t=10198) Companions of the Prophet deified the  
[2:50:01](https://youtu.be/3k6MBedWTww?t=10201) Prophet well when he died Abu Bakr told  
[2:50:04](https://youtu.be/3k6MBedWTww?t=10204) the people that he told the people that  
[2:50:06](https://youtu.be/3k6MBedWTww?t=10206) the Prophet has passed away but God is  
[2:50:08](https://youtu.be/3k6MBedWTww?t=10208) alive and he can never die Sahih Bukhari  
[2:50:11](https://youtu.be/3k6MBedWTww?t=10211) book 64 hadith 472 now before that was  
[2:50:15](https://youtu.be/3k6MBedWTww?t=10215) just a clarification my question is in  
[2:50:17](https://youtu.be/3k6MBedWTww?t=10217) the Old Testament God says he is not a  
[2:50:19](https://youtu.be/3k6MBedWTww?t=10219) man Hosea 11 9 and he is not the son of  
[2:50:22](https://youtu.be/3k6MBedWTww?t=10222) a man numbers 23:19 and he has full  
[2:50:25](https://youtu.be/3k6MBedWTww?t=10225) knowledge psalms 147 Jesus is a man he  
[2:50:29](https://youtu.be/3k6MBedWTww?t=10229) calls himself the son of man and he  
[2:50:31](https://youtu.be/3k6MBedWTww?t=10231) doesn't know everything Christians will  
[2:50:32](https://youtu.be/3k6MBedWTww?t=10232) say that was before he took on the body  
[2:50:34](https://youtu.be/3k6MBedWTww?t=10234) and he took on the attributes of man but  
[2:50:36](https://youtu.be/3k6MBedWTww?t=10236) doesn't this contradict Malachi 3:6  
[2:50:38](https://youtu.be/3k6MBedWTww?t=10238) where the Lord says he does not change  
[2:50:43](https://youtu.be/3k6MBedWTww?t=10243) [Applause]  
[2:50:49](https://youtu.be/3k6MBedWTww?t=10249) I was like 12 things yeah it was one  
[2:50:54](https://youtu.be/3k6MBedWTww?t=10254) thing try to answer whatever you can all  
[2:50:56](https://youtu.be/3k6MBedWTww?t=10256) right as far as yeah we understand that  
[2:50:58](https://youtu.be/3k6MBedWTww?t=10258) Muhammad has died that the problem is  
[2:51:00](https://youtu.be/3k6MBedWTww?t=10260) that Islam keeps taking these things  
[2:51:02](https://youtu.be/3k6MBedWTww?t=10262) like the black stone and the Kaaba and  
[2:51:05](https://youtu.be/3k6MBedWTww?t=10265) Muhammad and treating them in a way that  
[2:51:07](https://youtu.be/3k6MBedWTww?t=10267) is far beyond what you would expect for  
[2:51:09](https://youtu.be/3k6MBedWTww?t=10269) a mere creation so yes I understand  
[2:51:11](https://youtu.be/3k6MBedWTww?t=10271) you know Muhammad died and is not a god  
[2:51:13](https://youtu.be/3k6MBedWTww?t=10273) in that sense I'm saying they're showing  
[2:51:15](https://youtu.be/3k6MBedWTww?t=10275) reverence that should never be shown to  
[2:51:17](https://youtu.be/3k6MBedWTww?t=10277) a mere human being as far as God not  
[2:51:20](https://youtu.be/3k6MBedWTww?t=10280) being a man or the son of man if you  
[2:51:23](https://youtu.be/3k6MBedWTww?t=10283) look what's what's being said there God  
[2:51:25](https://youtu.be/3k6MBedWTww?t=10285) is asked to change his mind he said God  
[2:51:27](https://youtu.be/3k6MBedWTww?t=10287) is not a man that he should then he  
[2:51:29](https://youtu.be/3k6MBedWTww?t=10289) should change his mind so it's saying  
[2:51:31](https://youtu.be/3k6MBedWTww?t=10291) his character is not going to change  
[2:51:32](https://youtu.be/3k6MBedWTww?t=10292) which is the same thing you find in  
[2:51:33](https://youtu.be/3k6MBedWTww?t=10293) Malachi God is not going to change his  
[2:51:36](https://youtu.be/3k6MBedWTww?t=10296) character or in that way it doesn't mean  
[2:51:37](https://youtu.be/3k6MBedWTww?t=10297) God can never do something different in  
[2:51:39](https://youtu.be/3k6MBedWTww?t=10299) some way or that God can't can't enter  
[2:51:43](https://youtu.be/3k6MBedWTww?t=10303) creation he starts enters creation  
[2:51:45](https://youtu.be/3k6MBedWTww?t=10305) repeatedly in Genesis right he walks in  
[2:51:47](https://youtu.be/3k6MBedWTww?t=10307) the garden with Adam so he appears to  
[2:51:49](https://youtu.be/3k6MBedWTww?t=10309) Abraham so God does that's not what  
[2:51:52](https://youtu.be/3k6MBedWTww?t=10312) they're talking about as far as as far  
[2:51:54](https://youtu.be/3k6MBedWTww?t=10314) as God changing house the best I could  
[2:51:57](https://youtu.be/3k6MBedWTww?t=10317) do in one man one question for mister  
[2:52:02](https://youtu.be/3k6MBedWTww?t=10322) good job yes yes the prophet muhammad's  
[2:52:12](https://youtu.be/3k6MBedWTww?t=10332) allah wa sallam uses the bible as his  
[2:52:16](https://youtu.be/3k6MBedWTww?t=10336) basis to validate his prophethood  
[2:52:19](https://youtu.be/3k6MBedWTww?t=10339) especially in the words of Jesus Christ  
[2:52:22](https://youtu.be/3k6MBedWTww?t=10342) when Jesus Christ said I'm going to the  
[2:52:24](https://youtu.be/3k6MBedWTww?t=10344) Father and our sent you a comforter the  
[2:52:26](https://youtu.be/3k6MBedWTww?t=10346) Spirit of Truth teach you treat like one  
[2:52:32](https://youtu.be/3k6MBedWTww?t=10352) of your famous apologists and making  
[2:52:34](https://youtu.be/3k6MBedWTww?t=10354) that refers to that scripture as the  
[2:52:37](https://youtu.be/3k6MBedWTww?t=10357) validation for Prophet Muhammad's  
[2:52:39](https://youtu.be/3k6MBedWTww?t=10359) prophethood now what do we make of what  
[2:52:43](https://youtu.be/3k6MBedWTww?t=10363) Jesus Christ said emphatically to his  
[2:52:46](https://youtu.be/3k6MBedWTww?t=10366) disciples that they should go and wait  
[2:52:48](https://youtu.be/3k6MBedWTww?t=10368) upon him in Jerusalem and then the  
[2:52:52](https://youtu.be/3k6MBedWTww?t=10372) Spirit will come on them and in the  
[2:52:53](https://youtu.be/3k6MBedWTww?t=10373) prophets we witness a spectacle where  
[2:52:57](https://youtu.be/3k6MBedWTww?t=10377) the Holy Spirit comes to the disciple as  
[2:52:59](https://youtu.be/3k6MBedWTww?t=10379) cloven tongues on fire and we see a  
[2:53:02](https://youtu.be/3k6MBedWTww?t=10382) significant transformation from in the  
[2:53:05](https://youtu.be/3k6MBedWTww?t=10385) lives of the disciples and from there  
[2:53:08](https://youtu.be/3k6MBedWTww?t=10388) even the Roman government could not  
[2:53:11](https://youtu.be/3k6MBedWTww?t=10391) resist the power and the demonstration  
[2:53:14](https://youtu.be/3k6MBedWTww?t=10394) of the Holy Spirit at work in the  
[2:53:16](https://youtu.be/3k6MBedWTww?t=10396) disciples and over the years  
[2:53:19](https://youtu.be/3k6MBedWTww?t=10399) Christianity has spread not by sword by  
[2:53:22](https://youtu.be/3k6MBedWTww?t=10402) by the demonstration of the love power  
[2:53:24](https://youtu.be/3k6MBedWTww?t=10404) of the Holy Spirit how do we reconcile  
[2:53:27](https://youtu.be/3k6MBedWTww?t=10407) these demonstrations of the Holy Spirit  
[2:53:35](https://youtu.be/3k6MBedWTww?t=10415) just one request we're gonna after this  
[2:53:38](https://youtu.be/3k6MBedWTww?t=10418) we're gonna have to sing just two more  
[2:53:39](https://youtu.be/3k6MBedWTww?t=10419) questions and try to keep you questions  
[2:53:41](https://youtu.be/3k6MBedWTww?t=10421) like like you know as simple as possible  
[2:53:45](https://youtu.be/3k6MBedWTww?t=10425) because you know we're trying to take as  
[2:53:46](https://youtu.be/3k6MBedWTww?t=10426) much place as I can but you know it's  
[2:53:48](https://youtu.be/3k6MBedWTww?t=10428) impossible with you stretching the  
[2:53:50](https://youtu.be/3k6MBedWTww?t=10430) questions like that because we have  
[2:53:50](https://youtu.be/3k6MBedWTww?t=10430) limited time so okay so there are a few  
[2:53:53](https://youtu.be/3k6MBedWTww?t=10433) points the first thing you said it's  
[2:53:55](https://youtu.be/3k6MBedWTww?t=10435) about taking the Bible as an authority  
[2:53:56](https://youtu.be/3k6MBedWTww?t=10436) yes the Quran says the in GD that told  
[2:53:59](https://youtu.be/3k6MBedWTww?t=10439) up but the original one center of Moses  
[2:54:01](https://youtu.be/3k6MBedWTww?t=10441) and Jesus and the evidence of that is  
[2:54:02](https://youtu.be/3k6MBedWTww?t=10442) chapter 5 verse 46 where it talks about  
[2:54:05](https://youtu.be/3k6MBedWTww?t=10445) a failure and by the in the item in the  
[2:54:06](https://youtu.be/3k6MBedWTww?t=10446) Maryam and then it goes well yeah metal  
[2:54:08](https://youtu.be/3k6MBedWTww?t=10448) indeed women under the Lavi the land  
[2:54:11](https://youtu.be/3k6MBedWTww?t=10451) is Alam Talia al Ghul to me says this  
[2:54:13](https://youtu.be/3k6MBedWTww?t=10453) meaning it goes back to the previous  
[2:54:14](https://youtu.be/3k6MBedWTww?t=10454) passage and the next verse chapter 5  
[2:54:16](https://youtu.be/3k6MBedWTww?t=10456) verse 48 says what more Haman and Ali  
[2:54:18](https://youtu.be/3k6MBedWTww?t=10458) that the Quran is a guardian over the  
[2:54:20](https://youtu.be/3k6MBedWTww?t=10460) Bible yes this book is a guardian over  
[2:54:21](https://youtu.be/3k6MBedWTww?t=10461) this  
[2:54:22](https://youtu.be/3k6MBedWTww?t=10462) so it's an authority in as much as it  
[2:54:24](https://youtu.be/3k6MBedWTww?t=10464) does not contradict the Quran according  
[2:54:25](https://youtu.be/3k6MBedWTww?t=10465) to the Quran  
[2:54:26](https://youtu.be/3k6MBedWTww?t=10466) now that's point 1 point 2 about  
[2:54:29](https://youtu.be/3k6MBedWTww?t=10469) Christianity not being spread by the  
[2:54:30](https://youtu.be/3k6MBedWTww?t=10470) sword is a misreading of history  
[2:54:32](https://youtu.be/3k6MBedWTww?t=10472) actually if you look at Constantine and  
[2:54:34](https://youtu.be/3k6MBedWTww?t=10474) the Theodosian code actually the only  
[2:54:36](https://youtu.be/3k6MBedWTww?t=10476) way Johnse spread through the Roman  
[2:54:38](https://youtu.be/3k6MBedWTww?t=10478) Empire was through the sword look at the  
[2:54:41](https://youtu.be/3k6MBedWTww?t=10481) primary source material but a deviation  
[2:54:43](https://youtu.be/3k6MBedWTww?t=10483) code from Philadelphia the audience is  
[2:54:45](https://youtu.be/3k6MBedWTww?t=10485) the second he enforced Nicean  
[2:54:48](https://youtu.be/3k6MBedWTww?t=10488) trinitarianism by force according to all  
[2:54:51](https://youtu.be/3k6MBedWTww?t=10491) of the historians across the whole of  
[2:54:53](https://youtu.be/3k6MBedWTww?t=10493) the Roman Empire until the pagan  
[2:54:54](https://youtu.be/3k6MBedWTww?t=10494) religions of the Romans were completely  
[2:54:56](https://youtu.be/3k6MBedWTww?t=10496) dissipated not to mention of course  
[2:54:58](https://youtu.be/3k6MBedWTww?t=10498) colonialism not to mention of course the  
[2:55:00](https://youtu.be/3k6MBedWTww?t=10500) Spanish The Economist not to mention of  
[2:55:03](https://youtu.be/3k6MBedWTww?t=10503) course one of the biggest one of the  
[2:55:05](https://youtu.be/3k6MBedWTww?t=10505) biggest casualties in war in human  
[2:55:08](https://youtu.be/3k6MBedWTww?t=10508) history  
[2:55:08](https://youtu.be/3k6MBedWTww?t=10508) yes one of the biggest was when the  
[2:55:10](https://youtu.be/3k6MBedWTww?t=10510) Spanish Empire and the French Empire and  
[2:55:13](https://youtu.be/3k6MBedWTww?t=10513) the British Empire spread it's your  
[2:55:15](https://youtu.be/3k6MBedWTww?t=10515) country in Africa it spread it  
[2:55:18](https://youtu.be/3k6MBedWTww?t=10518) everywhere  
[2:55:18](https://youtu.be/3k6MBedWTww?t=10518) don't tell me wasn't spread by the sword  
[2:55:22](https://youtu.be/3k6MBedWTww?t=10522) what are you talking about  
[2:55:25](https://youtu.be/3k6MBedWTww?t=10525) the difference between Islam and  
[2:55:26](https://youtu.be/3k6MBedWTww?t=10526) Christianity in this regard was a slam  
[2:55:29](https://youtu.be/3k6MBedWTww?t=10529) spread organically  
[2:55:30](https://youtu.be/3k6MBedWTww?t=10530) whereas Christianity required a man who  
[2:55:33](https://youtu.be/3k6MBedWTww?t=10533) was an empire at that time to spread it  
[2:55:35](https://youtu.be/3k6MBedWTww?t=10535) forcefully we fought as Muslims the  
[2:55:38](https://youtu.be/3k6MBedWTww?t=10538) bigger enemy you were the bigger enemy

[2:56:18](https://youtu.be/3k6MBedWTww?t=10578) Craig and how respectful they are but I  
[2:56:20](https://youtu.be/3k6MBedWTww?t=10580) mean if this doesn't work out maybe you  
[2:56:22](https://youtu.be/3k6MBedWTww?t=10582) can do some stand-up comedy but you  
[2:56:24](https://youtu.be/3k6MBedWTww?t=10584) asked me you asked somebody asked about  
[2:56:26](https://youtu.be/3k6MBedWTww?t=10586) knock is attack so could you please  
[2:56:27](https://youtu.be/3k6MBedWTww?t=10587) explain who Melchizedek was in the Old  
[2:56:29](https://youtu.be/3k6MBedWTww?t=10589) Testament thank you Oh with Melchizedek  
[2:56:33](https://youtu.be/3k6MBedWTww?t=10593) well we're down to one minute now but if  
[2:56:35](https://youtu.be/3k6MBedWTww?t=10595) you look at what the author of Hebrews  
[2:56:37](https://youtu.be/3k6MBedWTww?t=10597) is doing he's saying that the Jews  
[2:56:41](https://youtu.be/3k6MBedWTww?t=10601) already had their own priesthood the the  
[2:56:46](https://youtu.be/3k6MBedWTww?t=10606) Levitical priesthood but the Messiah is  
[2:56:48](https://youtu.be/3k6MBedWTww?t=10608) going to be from the order of  
[2:56:49](https://youtu.be/3k6MBedWTww?t=10609) Melchizedek so he basically says what  
[2:56:52](https://youtu.be/3k6MBedWTww?t=10612) are the differences in the descriptions  
[2:56:54](https://youtu.be/3k6MBedWTww?t=10614) in scripture he this is a guy who reads  
[2:56:56](https://youtu.be/3k6MBedWTww?t=10616) some kind of codes into the Bible right  
[2:56:58](https://youtu.be/3k6MBedWTww?t=10618) he's looking for codes in description  
[2:57:00](https://youtu.be/3k6MBedWTww?t=10620) they took this very seriously so he says  
[2:57:02](https://youtu.be/3k6MBedWTww?t=10622) what's the difference in the description  
[2:57:04](https://youtu.be/3k6MBedWTww?t=10624) textually between Melchizedek and Levi  
[2:57:09](https://youtu.be/3k6MBedWTww?t=10629) and that's going to tell us something  
[2:57:11](https://youtu.be/3k6MBedWTww?t=10631) about the Messiah so he starts doing  
[2:57:13](https://youtu.be/3k6MBedWTww?t=10633) this haha well we have a genealogy for  
[2:57:15](https://youtu.be/3k6MBedWTww?t=10635) Levi we have none from kissa death right  
[2:57:18](https://youtu.be/3k6MBedWTww?t=10638) and so he starts going down the list and  
[2:57:19](https://youtu.be/3k6MBedWTww?t=10639) then he draws a meaning out of it he's  
[2:57:21](https://youtu.be/3k6MBedWTww?t=10641) not actually saying that he's eternal or  
[2:57:23](https://youtu.be/3k6MBedWTww?t=10643) something like that he's saying  
[2:57:24](https://youtu.be/3k6MBedWTww?t=10644) according these passages we can learn  
[2:57:25](https://youtu.be/3k6MBedWTww?t=10645) something and his conclusion is that the  
[2:57:27](https://youtu.be/3k6MBedWTww?t=10647) Messiah is eternal not that not that not  
[2:57:30](https://youtu.be/3k6MBedWTww?t=10650) that  
[2:57:30](https://youtu.be/3k6MBedWTww?t=10650) Melchizedek is Thank You mr. president

[3:03:16](https://youtu.be/3k6MBedWTww?t=10996) percentage of Christians had memorized  
[3:03:19](https://youtu.be/3k6MBedWTww?t=10999) the entire Holy Bible  
[3:03:23](https://youtu.be/3k6MBedWTww?t=11003) [Applause]  
[3:03:33](https://youtu.be/3k6MBedWTww?t=11013) all the rules and everything this is  
[3:03:35](https://youtu.be/3k6MBedWTww?t=11015) David  
[3:03:39](https://youtu.be/3k6MBedWTww?t=11019) can you please settle down sir question  
[3:03:43](https://youtu.be/3k6MBedWTww?t=11023) what I know is that most of the Muslims  
[3:03:46](https://youtu.be/3k6MBedWTww?t=11026) memorize the Quran quickly and do you  
[3:03:49](https://youtu.be/3k6MBedWTww?t=11029) know any Muslims any Christians that  
[3:03:51](https://youtu.be/3k6MBedWTww?t=11031) memorize the Bible quickly or are any  
[3:03:54](https://youtu.be/3k6MBedWTww?t=11034) any percent of them well the the Quran  
[3:03:59](https://youtu.be/3k6MBedWTww?t=11039) is designed for an oral culture to be  
[3:04:01](https://youtu.be/3k6MBedWTww?t=11041) memorized easily right there are  
[3:04:12](https://youtu.be/3k6MBedWTww?t=11052) hundreds of thousands of people who have  
[3:04:14](https://youtu.be/3k6MBedWTww?t=11054) memorized dr. Seuss's green eggs and ham  
[3:04:16](https://youtu.be/3k6MBedWTww?t=11056) does that make it the Word of God ladies  
[3:04:19](https://youtu.be/3k6MBedWTww?t=11059) and gentlemen I'm trying to be  
[3:04:20](https://youtu.be/3k6MBedWTww?t=11060) respectful here so that's because these  
[3:04:22](https://youtu.be/3k6MBedWTww?t=11062) are young guys here Christian  
[3:04:24](https://youtu.be/3k6MBedWTww?t=11064) Christianity the Bible is meant to be a  
[3:04:27](https://youtu.be/3k6MBedWTww?t=11067) book that's read right that's the idea  
[3:04:30](https://youtu.be/3k6MBedWTww?t=11070) they they they wrote Creed's and you  
[3:04:32](https://youtu.be/3k6MBedWTww?t=11072) would memorize Creed's we have some of  
[3:04:34](https://youtu.be/3k6MBedWTww?t=11074) them they wrote songs they memorize  
[3:04:35](https://youtu.be/3k6MBedWTww?t=11075) songs but the the books of the Bible are  
[3:04:39](https://youtu.be/3k6MBedWTww?t=11079) written down to the books and to be read  
[3:04:42](https://youtu.be/3k6MBedWTww?t=11082) in public the Quran the Quran is meant  
[3:04:45](https://youtu.be/3k6MBedWTww?t=11085) to be is meant to be is meant to be  
[3:04:47](https://youtu.be/3k6MBedWTww?t=11087) memorized so there are different kinds  
[3:04:49](https://youtu.be/3k6MBedWTww?t=11089) of Scripture why you would say Oh a book  
[3:04:53](https://youtu.be/3k6MBedWTww?t=11093) that's more memorize ofwell or something  
[3:04:55](https://youtu.be/3k6MBedWTww?t=11095) like that is must be more the Word of  
[3:04:57](https://youtu.be/3k6MBedWTww?t=11097) God or something again that would make  
[3:04:59](https://youtu.be/3k6MBedWTww?t=11099) green eggs and ham much much more the  
[3:05:01](https://youtu.be/3k6MBedWTww?t=11101) Word of God than the Quran because it's  
[3:05:02](https://youtu.be/3k6MBedWTww?t=11102) much much easier to understand a little  
[3:05:07](https://youtu.be/3k6MBedWTww?t=11107) side note as far as mocking Muslims  
[3:05:09](https://youtu.be/3k6MBedWTww?t=11109) because it's been brought up like a  
[3:05:10](https://youtu.be/3k6MBedWTww?t=11110) thousand times I haven't I haven't I
