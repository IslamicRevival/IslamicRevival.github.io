[0:00:27](https://youtu.be/KLdjHNGf9XM?t=27) around\
[0:00:37](https://youtu.be/KLdjHNGf9XM?t=37) you know I questions everything from\
[0:00:39](https://youtu.be/KLdjHNGf9XM?t=39) Instagram\
[0:00:43](https://youtu.be/KLdjHNGf9XM?t=43) you're dealing with everything what are\
[0:00:45](https://youtu.be/KLdjHNGf9XM?t=45) okay let me ask you a question what\
[0:00:47](https://youtu.be/KLdjHNGf9XM?t=47) other like let's say the most common\
[0:00:49](https://youtu.be/KLdjHNGf9XM?t=49) problems your ear face as well as to the\
[0:00:52](https://youtu.be/KLdjHNGf9XM?t=52) issues that you use societal issues that\
[0:00:54](https://youtu.be/KLdjHNGf9XM?t=54) you keep like I keep coming up say you\
[0:01:02](https://youtu.be/KLdjHNGf9XM?t=62) know boil it down to the VFD I would say\
[0:01:04](https://youtu.be/KLdjHNGf9XM?t=64) people are not trusting their instincts\
[0:01:17](https://youtu.be/KLdjHNGf9XM?t=77) what do you mean by that can you give me\
[0:01:43](https://youtu.be/KLdjHNGf9XM?t=103) like more like a case study so you're\
[0:01:44](https://youtu.be/KLdjHNGf9XM?t=104) saying people are maybe they're not\
[0:01:45](https://youtu.be/KLdjHNGf9XM?t=105) aware or they're not confident in\
[0:01:47](https://youtu.be/KLdjHNGf9XM?t=107) themselves or what is it exactly they're\
[0:01:48](https://youtu.be/KLdjHNGf9XM?t=108) being told by multiple sources that what\
[0:01:50](https://youtu.be/KLdjHNGf9XM?t=110) have been one of our\
[0:01:58](https://youtu.be/KLdjHNGf9XM?t=118) challenges that people tell us our\
[0:02:01](https://youtu.be/KLdjHNGf9XM?t=121) supposed to be about sex for our bodies\
[0:02:04](https://youtu.be/KLdjHNGf9XM?t=124) okay\
[0:02:07](https://youtu.be/KLdjHNGf9XM?t=127) feel and we quickly believe that at age\
[0:02:10](https://youtu.be/KLdjHNGf9XM?t=130) 3 or 4 or 5 or 15 or 30\
[0:02:14](https://youtu.be/KLdjHNGf9XM?t=134) and it's hard to shake that so you might\
[0:02:16](https://youtu.be/KLdjHNGf9XM?t=136) have an instinct like I just want to\
[0:02:19](https://youtu.be/KLdjHNGf9XM?t=139) masturbate and that might be your thing\
[0:02:24](https://youtu.be/KLdjHNGf9XM?t=144) you should also be wanting to get\
[0:02:26](https://youtu.be/KLdjHNGf9XM?t=146) married to this type of person and we\
[0:02:28](https://youtu.be/KLdjHNGf9XM?t=148) having this type of sex with them and\
[0:02:30](https://youtu.be/KLdjHNGf9XM?t=150) once a week what spice a week but you\
[0:02:31](https://youtu.be/KLdjHNGf9XM?t=151) might be thinking I just want to it\
[0:02:33](https://youtu.be/KLdjHNGf9XM?t=153) whatever maybe you have your own beliefs\
[0:02:36](https://youtu.be/KLdjHNGf9XM?t=156) about what works for you is pornography\
[0:02:38](https://youtu.be/KLdjHNGf9XM?t=158) a big theme here in your work because is\
[0:02:41](https://youtu.be/KLdjHNGf9XM?t=161) it not so people certainly use doesn't\
[0:02:47](https://youtu.be/KLdjHNGf9XM?t=167) come out and but I think that usually\
[0:02:49](https://youtu.be/KLdjHNGf9XM?t=169) people have more questions around\
[0:02:51](https://youtu.be/KLdjHNGf9XM?t=171) interpersonal and Orin is usually not\
[0:02:56](https://youtu.be/KLdjHNGf9XM?t=176) into personal it born is in some way\
[0:02:59](https://youtu.be/KLdjHNGf9XM?t=179) interpersonal it's more the\
[0:03:00](https://youtu.be/KLdjHNGf9XM?t=180) interpersonal reaction where someone's\
[0:03:01](https://youtu.be/KLdjHNGf9XM?t=181) yeah\
[0:03:03](https://youtu.be/KLdjHNGf9XM?t=183) coming up against what if I ask you a\
[0:03:07](https://youtu.be/KLdjHNGf9XM?t=187) question do you find that there's a in\
[0:03:10](https://youtu.be/KLdjHNGf9XM?t=190) terms of males and females age groups\
[0:03:12](https://youtu.be/KLdjHNGf9XM?t=192) different demographics who seems to be\
[0:03:16](https://youtu.be/KLdjHNGf9XM?t=196) like let's say for example tense exhibit\
[0:03:18](https://youtu.be/KLdjHNGf9XM?t=198) than most insecurities or problems or\
[0:03:20](https://youtu.be/KLdjHNGf9XM?t=200) comments are there any specific classes\
[0:03:24](https://youtu.be/KLdjHNGf9XM?t=204) of people that you can say okay these\
[0:03:25](https://youtu.be/KLdjHNGf9XM?t=205) individuals keep coming up to think\
[0:03:34](https://youtu.be/KLdjHNGf9XM?t=214) about their sexuality or their gender or\
[0:03:36](https://youtu.be/KLdjHNGf9XM?t=216) their sexual expression or gender\
[0:03:38](https://youtu.be/KLdjHNGf9XM?t=218) identity yeah\
[0:03:43](https://youtu.be/KLdjHNGf9XM?t=223) theyõre we don't have\
[0:03:45](https://youtu.be/KLdjHNGf9XM?t=225) talking about but they have been dealing\
[0:03:48](https://youtu.be/KLdjHNGf9XM?t=228) with the front and center and sort of\
[0:03:49](https://youtu.be/KLdjHNGf9XM?t=229) being balanced\
[0:03:50](https://youtu.be/KLdjHNGf9XM?t=230) fivesome all around it\
[0:03:52](https://youtu.be/KLdjHNGf9XM?t=232) so in a lot of ways are people who are\
[0:03:54](https://youtu.be/KLdjHNGf9XM?t=234) queer or gender non-conforming or\
[0:03:57](https://youtu.be/KLdjHNGf9XM?t=237) transgender a lot of ways we regularly\
[0:04:04](https://youtu.be/KLdjHNGf9XM?t=244) challenge from family and other folks in\
[0:04:07](https://youtu.be/KLdjHNGf9XM?t=247) the world\
[0:04:09](https://youtu.be/KLdjHNGf9XM?t=249) challenged ourselves but that said I\
[0:04:13](https://youtu.be/KLdjHNGf9XM?t=253) really feel like one of the\
[0:04:15](https://youtu.be/KLdjHNGf9XM?t=255) misconceptions is that\
[0:04:18](https://youtu.be/KLdjHNGf9XM?t=258) different genders are extremely\
[0:04:19](https://youtu.be/KLdjHNGf9XM?t=259) different\
[0:04:22](https://youtu.be/KLdjHNGf9XM?t=262) research my stuff so there are tons of\
[0:04:28](https://youtu.be/KLdjHNGf9XM?t=268) I'm in you know\
[0:04:33](https://youtu.be/KLdjHNGf9XM?t=273) what kind of things today I mean you\
[0:04:35](https://youtu.be/KLdjHNGf9XM?t=275) talked about for example homosexual\
[0:04:37](https://youtu.be/KLdjHNGf9XM?t=277) community right are the challenges faced\
[0:04:39](https://youtu.be/KLdjHNGf9XM?t=279) by the homosexual community different\
[0:04:42](https://youtu.be/KLdjHNGf9XM?t=282) from those faced by straight people for\
[0:04:45](https://youtu.be/KLdjHNGf9XM?t=285) example what kind of challenge what are\
[0:04:46](https://youtu.be/KLdjHNGf9XM?t=286) the differences similarities in\
[0:04:47](https://youtu.be/KLdjHNGf9XM?t=287) differences between the two committees\
[0:04:52](https://youtu.be/KLdjHNGf9XM?t=292) but in other words there is not right so\
[0:04:55](https://youtu.be/KLdjHNGf9XM?t=295) everyone is dealing not everyone many\
[0:04:57](https://youtu.be/KLdjHNGf9XM?t=297) people are dealing with the nice thing\
[0:05:01](https://youtu.be/KLdjHNGf9XM?t=301) is that is that big theme then social me\
[0:05:04](https://youtu.be/KLdjHNGf9XM?t=304) is that something which I wouldn't even\
[0:05:06](https://youtu.be/KLdjHNGf9XM?t=306) say no okay as an example of I okay so\
[0:05:12](https://youtu.be/KLdjHNGf9XM?t=312) people regardless into sexual\
[0:05:14](https://youtu.be/KLdjHNGf9XM?t=314) orientation yes\
[0:05:17](https://youtu.be/KLdjHNGf9XM?t=317) you know we're dealing with similar\
[0:05:18](https://youtu.be/KLdjHNGf9XM?t=318) things sometimes the overal are straight\
[0:05:21](https://youtu.be/KLdjHNGf9XM?t=321) maybe we are dealing with you know\
[0:05:23](https://youtu.be/KLdjHNGf9XM?t=323) feeling like they can experiment less\
[0:05:24](https://youtu.be/KLdjHNGf9XM?t=324) sexually we're\
[0:05:27](https://youtu.be/KLdjHNGf9XM?t=327) are given in some regards people want\
[0:05:31](https://youtu.be/KLdjHNGf9XM?t=331) permission around being more exploratory\
[0:05:34](https://youtu.be/KLdjHNGf9XM?t=334) I was out of thought started to deject I\
[0:05:36](https://youtu.be/KLdjHNGf9XM?t=336) mean just for a simple biological\
[0:05:39](https://youtu.be/KLdjHNGf9XM?t=339) perspective that would not be the case\
[0:05:41](https://youtu.be/KLdjHNGf9XM?t=341) in the sense that obviously a man and a\
[0:05:43](https://youtu.be/KLdjHNGf9XM?t=343) man can't do as much as a man and a\
[0:05:45](https://youtu.be/KLdjHNGf9XM?t=345) woman can do I mean just by virtue of\
[0:05:50](https://youtu.be/KLdjHNGf9XM?t=350) the fact that there's more\
[0:05:52](https://youtu.be/KLdjHNGf9XM?t=352) I mean there are differentiated entry\
[0:05:54](https://youtu.be/KLdjHNGf9XM?t=354) point alike it's not right I mean I I'd\
[0:06:03](https://youtu.be/KLdjHNGf9XM?t=363) see it under present differently\
[0:06:07](https://youtu.be/KLdjHNGf9XM?t=367) you see it this way yeah you know if\
[0:06:10](https://youtu.be/KLdjHNGf9XM?t=370) because if sex is more than in this\
[0:06:13](https://youtu.be/KLdjHNGf9XM?t=373) invention or canal or a penis and anus\
[0:06:15](https://youtu.be/KLdjHNGf9XM?t=375) or penis and throat or whatever baby\
[0:06:17](https://youtu.be/KLdjHNGf9XM?t=377) right or because people are sexual and\
[0:06:22](https://youtu.be/KLdjHNGf9XM?t=382) soon\
[0:06:23](https://youtu.be/KLdjHNGf9XM?t=383) for example two people looking at the\
[0:06:26](https://youtu.be/KLdjHNGf9XM?t=386) same computer screen\
[0:06:28](https://youtu.be/KLdjHNGf9XM?t=388) would you consider that sex if they\
[0:06:30](https://youtu.be/KLdjHNGf9XM?t=390) masturbate into the same computer screen\
[0:06:32](https://youtu.be/KLdjHNGf9XM?t=392) if they want to cause sex that's better\
[0:06:34](https://youtu.be/KLdjHNGf9XM?t=394) okay so how would you define things well\
[0:06:38](https://youtu.be/KLdjHNGf9XM?t=398) so sex is a complicated word because it\
[0:06:40](https://youtu.be/KLdjHNGf9XM?t=400) has different meanings in terms of\
[0:06:43](https://youtu.be/KLdjHNGf9XM?t=403) characteristics okay and then there are\
[0:06:44](https://youtu.be/KLdjHNGf9XM?t=404) things that people do that are sexual\
[0:06:46](https://youtu.be/KLdjHNGf9XM?t=406) with each other that people may consider\
[0:06:48](https://youtu.be/KLdjHNGf9XM?t=408) sex people making solo sex or\
[0:06:50](https://youtu.be/KLdjHNGf9XM?t=410) masturbation sex I like to really let\
[0:06:52](https://youtu.be/KLdjHNGf9XM?t=412) people make those\
[0:06:54](https://youtu.be/KLdjHNGf9XM?t=414) quite possible this yourself you quite\
[0:06:57](https://youtu.be/KLdjHNGf9XM?t=417) postmodernist i know he you think\
[0:06:59](https://youtu.be/KLdjHNGf9XM?t=419) outside the box in a sense yeah I liked\
[0:07:02](https://youtu.be/KLdjHNGf9XM?t=422) it I just noticed that as I said one of\
[0:07:07](https://youtu.be/KLdjHNGf9XM?t=427) the biggest issues that I see\
[0:07:09](https://youtu.be/KLdjHNGf9XM?t=429) scripts are some ways to be sexually and\
[0:07:12](https://youtu.be/KLdjHNGf9XM?t=432) I don't yeah if I\
[0:07:15](https://youtu.be/KLdjHNGf9XM?t=435) you know suggesting that somebody really\
[0:07:18](https://youtu.be/KLdjHNGf9XM?t=438) should I mean there must be prominent\
[0:07:21](https://youtu.be/KLdjHNGf9XM?t=441) that you put in place I mean how would\
[0:07:23](https://youtu.be/KLdjHNGf9XM?t=443) you feel about be Kelly for example\
[0:07:25](https://youtu.be/KLdjHNGf9XM?t=445) questions so you'll notice if you study\
[0:07:28](https://youtu.be/KLdjHNGf9XM?t=448) is really taboo topics right you know\
[0:07:32](https://youtu.be/KLdjHNGf9XM?t=452) things that we this is a true der in the\
[0:07:39](https://youtu.be/KLdjHNGf9XM?t=459) u.s. there are some states which allow\
[0:07:41](https://youtu.be/KLdjHNGf9XM?t=461) this jelly study or even if you just\
[0:07:50](https://youtu.be/KLdjHNGf9XM?t=470) look at twenty eighteen persistent on\
[0:07:51](https://youtu.be/KLdjHNGf9XM?t=471) each hand yes\
[0:07:55](https://youtu.be/KLdjHNGf9XM?t=475) not yet fortunately a lot of people\
[0:07:59](https://youtu.be/KLdjHNGf9XM?t=479) that were trending towards greater\
[0:08:01](https://youtu.be/KLdjHNGf9XM?t=481) conscious actions so in that sense you\
[0:08:04](https://youtu.be/KLdjHNGf9XM?t=484) know one of the\
[0:08:07](https://youtu.be/KLdjHNGf9XM?t=487) at least his consent\
[0:08:10](https://youtu.be/KLdjHNGf9XM?t=490) about nonhumans living being\
[0:08:15](https://youtu.be/KLdjHNGf9XM?t=495) instead of non yeah what's your view on\
[0:08:17](https://youtu.be/KLdjHNGf9XM?t=497) that well one of the things among others\
[0:08:20](https://youtu.be/KLdjHNGf9XM?t=500) that we often talk about is\
[0:08:26](https://youtu.be/KLdjHNGf9XM?t=506) not some\
[0:08:28](https://youtu.be/KLdjHNGf9XM?t=508) with nonhumans here\
[0:08:30](https://youtu.be/KLdjHNGf9XM?t=510) \[Music]\
[0:08:35](https://youtu.be/KLdjHNGf9XM?t=515) it does come up and it comes up a lot\
[0:08:37](https://youtu.be/KLdjHNGf9XM?t=517) does it really so what what kind of\
[0:08:38](https://youtu.be/KLdjHNGf9XM?t=518) countries does it come up in come that's\
[0:08:39](https://youtu.be/KLdjHNGf9XM?t=519) quite well I usually might like to not\
[0:08:41](https://youtu.be/KLdjHNGf9XM?t=521) name certain countries okay about which\
[0:08:44](https://youtu.be/KLdjHNGf9XM?t=524) countries nope / yeah maybe Neil he\
[0:08:50](https://youtu.be/KLdjHNGf9XM?t=530) wants to know I mean you know I would\
[0:08:54](https://youtu.be/KLdjHNGf9XM?t=534) say if we were you know the cameras were\
[0:08:55](https://youtu.be/KLdjHNGf9XM?t=535) near what not I would but I just like my\
[0:08:57](https://youtu.be/KLdjHNGf9XM?t=537) I understand you don't incite anything\
[0:09:00](https://youtu.be/KLdjHNGf9XM?t=540) yeah yeah yeah no no problem\
[0:09:03](https://youtu.be/KLdjHNGf9XM?t=543) yeah yeah it comes up this is this is\
[0:09:08](https://youtu.be/KLdjHNGf9XM?t=548) the thing this is the question like for\
[0:09:12](https://youtu.be/KLdjHNGf9XM?t=552) my paradigm choose do you have a\
[0:09:15](https://youtu.be/KLdjHNGf9XM?t=555) question because I know it's obvious I'm\
[0:09:17](https://youtu.be/KLdjHNGf9XM?t=557) a Muslim right I'm a believer of\
[0:09:19](https://youtu.be/KLdjHNGf9XM?t=559) scripture scripture list if you like\
[0:09:20](https://youtu.be/KLdjHNGf9XM?t=560) traditionalist and it's not just Muslims\
[0:09:22](https://youtu.be/KLdjHNGf9XM?t=562) that have parameters that are finally\
[0:09:25](https://youtu.be/KLdjHNGf9XM?t=565) all very much defined by Scriptures it's\
[0:09:28](https://youtu.be/KLdjHNGf9XM?t=568) also Christian Jews all sort of\
[0:09:30](https://youtu.be/KLdjHNGf9XM?t=570) different like you were talking about\
[0:09:31](https://youtu.be/KLdjHNGf9XM?t=571) kind of I think you applied it in some\
[0:09:32](https://youtu.be/KLdjHNGf9XM?t=572) of what you were saying so obviously for\
[0:09:34](https://youtu.be/KLdjHNGf9XM?t=574) us it's a matter of looking at the text\
[0:09:36](https://youtu.be/KLdjHNGf9XM?t=576) and seeing okay well this is in\
[0:09:38](https://youtu.be/KLdjHNGf9XM?t=578) accordance with God's will and it isn't\
[0:09:40](https://youtu.be/KLdjHNGf9XM?t=580) according to protocol so it's very much\
[0:09:41](https://youtu.be/KLdjHNGf9XM?t=581) divine command theory if you like you\
[0:09:43](https://youtu.be/KLdjHNGf9XM?t=583) know you believe that the authority goes\
[0:09:45](https://youtu.be/KLdjHNGf9XM?t=585) to the text and therefore\
[0:09:46](https://youtu.be/KLdjHNGf9XM?t=586) we act in accordance to it right so it's\
[0:09:49](https://youtu.be/KLdjHNGf9XM?t=589) much more rigid if you like it's these\
[0:09:51](https://youtu.be/KLdjHNGf9XM?t=591) are the parameters right you can't go\
[0:09:53](https://youtu.be/KLdjHNGf9XM?t=593) for for example homosexuality and Islam\
[0:09:55](https://youtu.be/KLdjHNGf9XM?t=595) is not permissible you know obviously\
[0:09:58](https://youtu.be/KLdjHNGf9XM?t=598) Judaism in Australia it's not\
[0:10:00](https://youtu.be/KLdjHNGf9XM?t=600) permissible you can't have sex with\
[0:10:01](https://youtu.be/KLdjHNGf9XM?t=601) another man or a woman having sex with\
[0:10:05](https://youtu.be/KLdjHNGf9XM?t=605) another woman in fact\
[0:10:06](https://youtu.be/KLdjHNGf9XM?t=606) Islam wouldn't define a woman you know a\
[0:10:10](https://youtu.be/KLdjHNGf9XM?t=610) pleasure in another woman has even sex\
[0:10:12](https://youtu.be/KLdjHNGf9XM?t=612) frankly right because because we this\
[0:10:14](https://youtu.be/KLdjHNGf9XM?t=614) there's very key definitions for\
[0:10:17](https://youtu.be/KLdjHNGf9XM?t=617) instance sex would be seen as either\
[0:10:20](https://youtu.be/KLdjHNGf9XM?t=620) penetration from a vagina in a Varnado\
[0:10:23](https://youtu.be/KLdjHNGf9XM?t=623) sense all analysis these two things\
[0:10:25](https://youtu.be/KLdjHNGf9XM?t=625) would be\
[0:10:26](https://youtu.be/KLdjHNGf9XM?t=626) as a section Islam that wouldn't be seen\
[0:10:30](https://youtu.be/KLdjHNGf9XM?t=630) as sex enough would not it's something\
[0:10:34](https://youtu.be/KLdjHNGf9XM?t=634) extra something else but it's not sex in\
[0:10:37](https://youtu.be/KLdjHNGf9XM?t=637) the in the in the scripture in a strict\
[0:10:40](https://youtu.be/KLdjHNGf9XM?t=640) scriptural sense so yeah so from that\
[0:10:44](https://youtu.be/KLdjHNGf9XM?t=644) perspective we have very strict\
[0:10:46](https://youtu.be/KLdjHNGf9XM?t=646) guidelines and things like that but it\
[0:10:49](https://youtu.be/KLdjHNGf9XM?t=649) always but it is a no sex is not allowed\
[0:10:51](https://youtu.be/KLdjHNGf9XM?t=651) in Islam quite it's considered sex yeah\
[0:10:54](https://youtu.be/KLdjHNGf9XM?t=654) just sorry thank you for the\
[0:10:56](https://youtu.be/KLdjHNGf9XM?t=656) clarification it's not allowed whether\
[0:10:58](https://youtu.be/KLdjHNGf9XM?t=658) it's from man to man or man to woman by\
[0:11:00](https://youtu.be/KLdjHNGf9XM?t=660) a woman\
[0:11:02](https://youtu.be/KLdjHNGf9XM?t=662) now lesson won't remember that's not\
[0:11:04](https://youtu.be/KLdjHNGf9XM?t=664) what's the wrath that's very possible\
[0:11:05](https://youtu.be/KLdjHNGf9XM?t=665) happens all the time actually it's\
[0:11:07](https://youtu.be/KLdjHNGf9XM?t=667) actually I'm saying that in a lot of\
[0:11:10](https://youtu.be/KLdjHNGf9XM?t=670) those sex shops here it's one of the\
[0:11:12](https://youtu.be/KLdjHNGf9XM?t=672) most common classes that we teach about\
[0:11:15](https://youtu.be/KLdjHNGf9XM?t=675) golf\
[0:11:16](https://youtu.be/KLdjHNGf9XM?t=676) so women having anal sex with men\
[0:11:20](https://youtu.be/KLdjHNGf9XM?t=680) Bhavana t monster it's a bit unusual it\
[0:11:23](https://youtu.be/KLdjHNGf9XM?t=683) doesn't undermine lesbianism in a sense\
[0:11:25](https://youtu.be/KLdjHNGf9XM?t=685) right because if a woman is strapping on\
[0:11:27](https://youtu.be/KLdjHNGf9XM?t=687) sorry to say why she's doing that then\
[0:11:32](https://youtu.be/KLdjHNGf9XM?t=692) it doesn't that kind of in a sense under\
[0:11:34](https://youtu.be/KLdjHNGf9XM?t=694) - sexual lesbian at least like because\
[0:11:36](https://youtu.be/KLdjHNGf9XM?t=696) sexual lesbians do lashes you know kind\
[0:11:39](https://youtu.be/KLdjHNGf9XM?t=699) of being attracted to the female organs\
[0:11:42](https://youtu.be/KLdjHNGf9XM?t=702) in a post office even to male sexual\
[0:11:44](https://youtu.be/KLdjHNGf9XM?t=704) things but if you're if you're trying to\
[0:11:46](https://youtu.be/KLdjHNGf9XM?t=706) emulate no sexual organs and it would\
[0:11:48](https://youtu.be/KLdjHNGf9XM?t=708) kind of in price on how that you're\
[0:11:50](https://youtu.be/KLdjHNGf9XM?t=710) sexually attracted to them so maybe that\
[0:11:52](https://youtu.be/KLdjHNGf9XM?t=712) women that do that shouldn't they be\
[0:11:54](https://youtu.be/KLdjHNGf9XM?t=714) accused of some kind of bisexual that\
[0:11:56](https://youtu.be/KLdjHNGf9XM?t=716) way refusing it is it not it's not\
[0:11:58](https://youtu.be/KLdjHNGf9XM?t=718) viewable into available\
[0:12:09](https://youtu.be/KLdjHNGf9XM?t=729) I've been somewhere that the shape of a\
[0:12:11](https://youtu.be/KLdjHNGf9XM?t=731) penis there's a lot of you know I think\
[0:12:17](https://youtu.be/KLdjHNGf9XM?t=737) maybe assumptions and it built into that\
[0:12:19](https://youtu.be/KLdjHNGf9XM?t=739) and so what's your view on here's the\
[0:12:22](https://youtu.be/KLdjHNGf9XM?t=742) thing right anus has a gang of nerve\
[0:12:25](https://youtu.be/KLdjHNGf9XM?t=745) endings okay and so the \[ \_\_ ] me off\
[0:12:30](https://youtu.be/KLdjHNGf9XM?t=750) right the anus is a sensitive area\
[0:12:37](https://youtu.be/KLdjHNGf9XM?t=757) other people breaking so whether good\
[0:12:40](https://youtu.be/KLdjHNGf9XM?t=760) so another partner a partner who's male\
[0:12:45](https://youtu.be/KLdjHNGf9XM?t=765) transgender a person it's a partner who\
[0:12:47](https://youtu.be/KLdjHNGf9XM?t=767) they can't see and they don't know it's\
[0:12:49](https://youtu.be/KLdjHNGf9XM?t=769) a severe and woman are transgender\
[0:12:51](https://youtu.be/KLdjHNGf9XM?t=771) person stimulating my anus their anus\
[0:12:55](https://youtu.be/KLdjHNGf9XM?t=775) you can also question and this is\
[0:12:58](https://youtu.be/KLdjHNGf9XM?t=778) because I was looking at some reports\
[0:13:00](https://youtu.be/KLdjHNGf9XM?t=780) you useful for the UN is no so I was\
[0:13:03](https://youtu.be/KLdjHNGf9XM?t=783) looking at some report from the World\
[0:13:04](https://youtu.be/KLdjHNGf9XM?t=784) Health Organization and also we've got\
[0:13:07](https://youtu.be/KLdjHNGf9XM?t=787) in the UK cuz I'm from the UK probably\
[0:13:08](https://youtu.be/KLdjHNGf9XM?t=788) together Maxim right we've got some\
[0:13:11](https://youtu.be/KLdjHNGf9XM?t=791) reports written by the NHS acceptor and\
[0:13:14](https://youtu.be/KLdjHNGf9XM?t=794) what seems to be a common thing that is\
[0:13:16](https://youtu.be/KLdjHNGf9XM?t=796) said and we're not saying that\
[0:13:18](https://youtu.be/KLdjHNGf9XM?t=798) correlation equals causation any of that\
[0:13:19](https://youtu.be/KLdjHNGf9XM?t=799) but we're saying that one thing which is\
[0:13:21](https://youtu.be/KLdjHNGf9XM?t=801) commonly said about homosexuals they\
[0:13:23](https://youtu.be/KLdjHNGf9XM?t=803) they have a higher propensity to\
[0:13:27](https://youtu.be/KLdjHNGf9XM?t=807) sexually transmitted diseases in fact\
[0:13:29](https://youtu.be/KLdjHNGf9XM?t=809) there's some like the wh old since it's\
[0:13:31](https://youtu.be/KLdjHNGf9XM?t=811) like 13 times more likely to contract\
[0:13:33](https://youtu.be/KLdjHNGf9XM?t=813) aid 13 times more likely to contract\
[0:13:35](https://youtu.be/KLdjHNGf9XM?t=815) gonorrhea or whatever it may be right so\
[0:13:39](https://youtu.be/KLdjHNGf9XM?t=819) I guess what I'm asking is if we're if\
[0:13:42](https://youtu.be/KLdjHNGf9XM?t=822) we're doing the social analysis here of\
[0:13:44](https://youtu.be/KLdjHNGf9XM?t=824) of homosexual type sex or anal sex not\
[0:13:49](https://youtu.be/KLdjHNGf9XM?t=829) even just a man and a man to be a man a\
[0:13:50](https://youtu.be/KLdjHNGf9XM?t=830) woman even if we don't you know sex or\
[0:13:55](https://youtu.be/KLdjHNGf9XM?t=835) I'm calling I'm calling an anal sex for\
[0:13:58](https://youtu.be/KLdjHNGf9XM?t=838) now yeah but also specifically because\
[0:14:00](https://youtu.be/KLdjHNGf9XM?t=840) all statistics are specified from\
[0:14:02](https://youtu.be/KLdjHNGf9XM?t=842) sexuals right ok so those 2 to 6 times\
[0:14:06](https://youtu.be/KLdjHNGf9XM?t=846) just McCrory there's not about anal sex\
[0:14:08](https://youtu.be/KLdjHNGf9XM?t=848) about homosexuals yeah so could there be\
[0:14:11](https://youtu.be/KLdjHNGf9XM?t=851) a case that homosexual sex if we're\
[0:14:15](https://youtu.be/KLdjHNGf9XM?t=855) looking at a kind of an aggregate of\
[0:14:16](https://youtu.be/KLdjHNGf9XM?t=856) social pros and cons could be more\
[0:14:21](https://youtu.be/KLdjHNGf9XM?t=861) harmful than is producer but he just\
[0:14:36](https://youtu.be/KLdjHNGf9XM?t=876) won't face any sex this point of\
[0:14:38](https://youtu.be/KLdjHNGf9XM?t=878) homosexuals having more likelihood of\
[0:14:40](https://youtu.be/KLdjHNGf9XM?t=880) you see contracting those diseases is\
[0:14:44](https://youtu.be/KLdjHNGf9XM?t=884) that is that concern for it within\
[0:14:46](https://youtu.be/KLdjHNGf9XM?t=886) homosexual circles or\
[0:14:53](https://youtu.be/KLdjHNGf9XM?t=893) so yes I think that one of the things\
[0:14:55](https://youtu.be/KLdjHNGf9XM?t=895) that would be beneficial is to just\
[0:14:58](https://youtu.be/KLdjHNGf9XM?t=898) broaden our understanding of sex so\
[0:15:01](https://youtu.be/KLdjHNGf9XM?t=901) there's\
[0:15:01](https://youtu.be/KLdjHNGf9XM?t=901) hey sex is not homosexual sex there are\
[0:15:05](https://youtu.be/KLdjHNGf9XM?t=905) people who get together and do things\
[0:15:07](https://youtu.be/KLdjHNGf9XM?t=907) with their bodies that may\
[0:15:10](https://youtu.be/KLdjHNGf9XM?t=910) so there's not one type of\
[0:15:14](https://youtu.be/KLdjHNGf9XM?t=914) it's just people just proteins with\
[0:15:16](https://youtu.be/KLdjHNGf9XM?t=916) their bodies I feel good or that maybe\
[0:15:18](https://youtu.be/KLdjHNGf9XM?t=918) build\
[0:15:20](https://youtu.be/KLdjHNGf9XM?t=920) right\
[0:15:23](https://youtu.be/KLdjHNGf9XM?t=923) I guess your question is is when things\
[0:15:27](https://youtu.be/KLdjHNGf9XM?t=927) happen to certain communities are they\
[0:15:28](https://youtu.be/KLdjHNGf9XM?t=928) concerning\
[0:15:30](https://youtu.be/KLdjHNGf9XM?t=930) yeah I mean let's be frank I mean all\
[0:15:33](https://youtu.be/KLdjHNGf9XM?t=933) communities have to be somewhat\
[0:15:34](https://youtu.be/KLdjHNGf9XM?t=934) introspective right in the sense that\
[0:15:37](https://youtu.be/KLdjHNGf9XM?t=937) for example if there are diseases\
[0:15:40](https://youtu.be/KLdjHNGf9XM?t=940) related to certain race groups I don't\
[0:15:42](https://youtu.be/KLdjHNGf9XM?t=942) think it's racist to kind of clarify\
[0:15:44](https://youtu.be/KLdjHNGf9XM?t=944) that for example sub-saharan Africa we\
[0:15:46](https://youtu.be/KLdjHNGf9XM?t=946) have there's more likelihood of there\
[0:15:48](https://youtu.be/KLdjHNGf9XM?t=948) being AIDS it's not I'm not saying it's\
[0:15:49](https://youtu.be/KLdjHNGf9XM?t=949) for racial reason but when we start to\
[0:15:52](https://youtu.be/KLdjHNGf9XM?t=952) kind of look at these things objectively\
[0:15:54](https://youtu.be/KLdjHNGf9XM?t=954) scientifically if you like right you\
[0:15:56](https://youtu.be/KLdjHNGf9XM?t=956) know science can be very useful in these\
[0:15:58](https://youtu.be/KLdjHNGf9XM?t=958) things right all I'm asking is that if\
[0:16:01](https://youtu.be/KLdjHNGf9XM?t=961) if there is a spread of disease which is\
[0:16:03](https://youtu.be/KLdjHNGf9XM?t=963) exacerbated in a certain community\
[0:16:05](https://youtu.be/KLdjHNGf9XM?t=965) doesn't it make sense to question the\
[0:16:08](https://youtu.be/KLdjHNGf9XM?t=968) reasoning for that disease yeah so so\
[0:16:11](https://youtu.be/KLdjHNGf9XM?t=971) from that perspective going back to\
[0:16:13](https://youtu.be/KLdjHNGf9XM?t=973) because I think the paradigm you're\
[0:16:14](https://youtu.be/KLdjHNGf9XM?t=974) working from is so long as it feels good\
[0:16:15](https://youtu.be/KLdjHNGf9XM?t=975) it's it's okay it's permissible so long\
[0:16:22](https://youtu.be/KLdjHNGf9XM?t=982) as this consent and it feels good I mean\
[0:16:23](https://youtu.be/KLdjHNGf9XM?t=983) no one's maybe harming each other\
[0:16:25](https://youtu.be/KLdjHNGf9XM?t=985) ya know rape or anything like that right\
[0:16:28](https://youtu.be/KLdjHNGf9XM?t=988) so if that's kind of like a liberal\
[0:16:30](https://youtu.be/KLdjHNGf9XM?t=990) opposition\
[0:16:33](https://youtu.be/KLdjHNGf9XM?t=993) why not\
[0:16:40](https://youtu.be/KLdjHNGf9XM?t=1000) yeah I would I would consider a liberal\
[0:16:42](https://youtu.be/KLdjHNGf9XM?t=1002) only because it conforms to\
[0:16:44](https://youtu.be/KLdjHNGf9XM?t=1004) philosophical liberalism right so yeah\
[0:16:46](https://youtu.be/KLdjHNGf9XM?t=1006) so in the sense that you know you can do\
[0:16:48](https://youtu.be/KLdjHNGf9XM?t=1008) everyone so long as you don't harm\
[0:16:49](https://youtu.be/KLdjHNGf9XM?t=1009) anyone else right so but here what\
[0:16:52](https://youtu.be/KLdjHNGf9XM?t=1012) Antoine ask me more specifically is if\
[0:16:54](https://youtu.be/KLdjHNGf9XM?t=1014) we can identify a social harm ha yeah a\
[0:17:00](https://youtu.be/KLdjHNGf9XM?t=1020) social harm which might not be direct\
[0:17:02](https://youtu.be/KLdjHNGf9XM?t=1022) what might be indirect right I might be\
[0:17:07](https://youtu.be/KLdjHNGf9XM?t=1027) identified when looking at a broad scale\
[0:17:11](https://youtu.be/KLdjHNGf9XM?t=1031) kind of time period so isn't it isn't it\
[0:17:17](https://youtu.be/KLdjHNGf9XM?t=1037) important for us to kind of question the\
[0:17:19](https://youtu.be/KLdjHNGf9XM?t=1039) reasons why this is happening in a\
[0:17:25](https://youtu.be/KLdjHNGf9XM?t=1045) nutshell if we know that the spread of\
[0:17:28](https://youtu.be/KLdjHNGf9XM?t=1048) diseases is exacerbated yes\
[0:17:31](https://youtu.be/KLdjHNGf9XM?t=1051) if the certain kind of sexual experiment\
[0:17:33](https://youtu.be/KLdjHNGf9XM?t=1053) is done between men and men anal sex\
[0:17:37](https://youtu.be/KLdjHNGf9XM?t=1057) shouldn't be questioned having sex in\
[0:17:40](https://youtu.be/KLdjHNGf9XM?t=1060) this way\
[0:17:46](https://youtu.be/KLdjHNGf9XM?t=1066) okay let me put it this way what are you\
[0:17:50](https://youtu.be/KLdjHNGf9XM?t=1070) trying to convince me of that or use do\
[0:17:52](https://youtu.be/KLdjHNGf9XM?t=1072) you want to do you want to know my\
[0:17:54](https://youtu.be/KLdjHNGf9XM?t=1074) opinion what's what are you I think it's\
[0:17:58](https://youtu.be/KLdjHNGf9XM?t=1078) a little bit more into baiting I'm just\
[0:18:00](https://youtu.be/KLdjHNGf9XM?t=1080) trying to see usually people sit down\
[0:18:02](https://youtu.be/KLdjHNGf9XM?t=1082) and never questions about someone\
[0:18:03](https://youtu.be/KLdjHNGf9XM?t=1083) they're dating or whatever it is\
[0:18:06](https://youtu.be/KLdjHNGf9XM?t=1086) yes yes I know but I'm trying to make\
[0:18:08](https://youtu.be/KLdjHNGf9XM?t=1088) I'm trying to understand seems like\
[0:18:10](https://youtu.be/KLdjHNGf9XM?t=1090) you're trying to put him in a corner\
[0:18:11](https://youtu.be/KLdjHNGf9XM?t=1091) that's my impression yeah it's true\
[0:18:15](https://youtu.be/KLdjHNGf9XM?t=1095) because that's what you're doing you're\
[0:18:16](https://youtu.be/KLdjHNGf9XM?t=1096) kind of interrogating him you don't have\
[0:18:18](https://youtu.be/KLdjHNGf9XM?t=1098) a specific question I'm fine I will say\
[0:18:27](https://youtu.be/KLdjHNGf9XM?t=1107) this though let's make this your last\
[0:18:29](https://youtu.be/KLdjHNGf9XM?t=1109) push it because I'm going to here to a\
[0:18:30](https://youtu.be/KLdjHNGf9XM?t=1110) five and I like to see a lot of people\
[0:18:31](https://youtu.be/KLdjHNGf9XM?t=1111) so no problem yeah yeah but your last\
[0:18:34](https://youtu.be/KLdjHNGf9XM?t=1114) person yeah so what one wonking eyes\
[0:18:37](https://youtu.be/KLdjHNGf9XM?t=1117) this drug if you deal with person visit\
[0:18:42](https://youtu.be/KLdjHNGf9XM?t=1122) a question or a statement let's start\
[0:18:43](https://youtu.be/KLdjHNGf9XM?t=1123) there question okay my question is\
[0:18:47](https://youtu.be/KLdjHNGf9XM?t=1127) simply\
[0:18:49](https://youtu.be/KLdjHNGf9XM?t=1129) if we can identify that X practice\
[0:18:54](https://youtu.be/KLdjHNGf9XM?t=1134) whoever that practice may be is causing\
[0:18:58](https://youtu.be/KLdjHNGf9XM?t=1138) is having an effect on society which\
[0:19:03](https://youtu.be/KLdjHNGf9XM?t=1143) might be detrimental\
[0:19:07](https://youtu.be/KLdjHNGf9XM?t=1147) shouldn't we question banks practice\
[0:19:09](https://youtu.be/KLdjHNGf9XM?t=1149) sure so you're saying like if men great\
[0:19:12](https://youtu.be/KLdjHNGf9XM?t=1152) women all the time which happens all the\
[0:19:14](https://youtu.be/KLdjHNGf9XM?t=1154) time you're saying simply question men\
[0:19:17](https://youtu.be/KLdjHNGf9XM?t=1157) living\
[0:19:17](https://youtu.be/KLdjHNGf9XM?t=1157) I don't think anyone questions that I\
[0:19:19](https://youtu.be/KLdjHNGf9XM?t=1159) think everyone knows that I think that's\
[0:19:21](https://youtu.be/KLdjHNGf9XM?t=1161) a university accepted at 1-over you're\
[0:19:23](https://youtu.be/KLdjHNGf9XM?t=1163) saying if most people accept up that's a\
[0:19:26](https://youtu.be/KLdjHNGf9XM?t=1166) long thing okay so you're you're so the\
[0:19:30](https://youtu.be/KLdjHNGf9XM?t=1170) question is that people idea has to same\
[0:19:32](https://youtu.be/KLdjHNGf9XM?t=1172) when you just ask\
[0:19:32](https://youtu.be/KLdjHNGf9XM?t=1172) \[Music]\
[0:19:34](https://youtu.be/KLdjHNGf9XM?t=1174) let me give an example right you know\
[0:19:36](https://youtu.be/KLdjHNGf9XM?t=1176) you know you know in the UK right you\
[0:19:39](https://youtu.be/KLdjHNGf9XM?t=1179) know smoking cigarettes I don't know\
[0:19:41](https://youtu.be/KLdjHNGf9XM?t=1181) what the rules are here but inside this\
[0:19:42](https://youtu.be/KLdjHNGf9XM?t=1182) is quite a law I don't know if it exists\
[0:19:44](https://youtu.be/KLdjHNGf9XM?t=1184) in this country or not\
[0:19:45](https://youtu.be/KLdjHNGf9XM?t=1185) passive smoke so for example am I going\
[0:19:47](https://youtu.be/KLdjHNGf9XM?t=1187) to the fair we can't smoke in this\
[0:19:49](https://youtu.be/KLdjHNGf9XM?t=1189) inside are you caught in the park isn't\
[0:19:50](https://youtu.be/KLdjHNGf9XM?t=1190) really oh that's interesting\
[0:19:52](https://youtu.be/KLdjHNGf9XM?t=1192) no flash you can smoke outside but you\
[0:19:54](https://youtu.be/KLdjHNGf9XM?t=1194) can't smoke inside yeah so if you go\
[0:19:56](https://youtu.be/KLdjHNGf9XM?t=1196) into a restaurant like Starbucks you\
[0:19:57](https://youtu.be/KLdjHNGf9XM?t=1197) can't smoke inside the thing and the\
[0:19:59](https://youtu.be/KLdjHNGf9XM?t=1199) rationale behind that is well if you do\
[0:20:01](https://youtu.be/KLdjHNGf9XM?t=1201) if you smoke and driving someone else\
[0:20:03](https://youtu.be/KLdjHNGf9XM?t=1203) but when you're having sex\
[0:20:04](https://youtu.be/KLdjHNGf9XM?t=1204) someone is deciding if I have sex with\
[0:20:07](https://youtu.be/KLdjHNGf9XM?t=1207) someone walking by that's me deciding to\
[0:20:09](https://youtu.be/KLdjHNGf9XM?t=1209) have sex with no no no yeah but what I'm\
[0:20:11](https://youtu.be/KLdjHNGf9XM?t=1211) saying is this this is the imagine want\
[0:20:13](https://youtu.be/KLdjHNGf9XM?t=1213) to draw we've specially transmitted\
[0:20:15](https://youtu.be/KLdjHNGf9XM?t=1215) diseases not all of them are transmitted\
[0:20:17](https://youtu.be/KLdjHNGf9XM?t=1217) through sex right it can be through\
[0:20:23](https://youtu.be/KLdjHNGf9XM?t=1223) blood movement or even even gonorrhea or\
[0:20:27](https://youtu.be/KLdjHNGf9XM?t=1227) syphilis a lot of them can be\
[0:20:28](https://youtu.be/KLdjHNGf9XM?t=1228) transferred transferred from other than\
[0:20:30](https://youtu.be/KLdjHNGf9XM?t=1230) sex you can transfer their yeah from so\
[0:20:33](https://youtu.be/KLdjHNGf9XM?t=1233) for example a mother can transfer a in\

[0:20:39](https://youtu.be/KLdjHNGf9XM?t=1239) diseases\
