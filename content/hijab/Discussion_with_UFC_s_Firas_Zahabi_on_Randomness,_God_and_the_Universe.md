Firas Zahabi discusses randomness and how it applies to the universe and to God. He argues that randomness is an important part of the universe, and that without it, there would be no order or design. He also says that a higher power is responsible for creating and maintaining the universe.

**[00:00:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1Z3A6N5ck3c\&t=0)** , Firas Zahabi discusses randomness and how it can be used in various ways, including to explain the universe. He also discusses the idea of a thought experiment, in which he flips a coin and tells someone it has a 50% chance of landing on s or tails. When the person has a history of seeing that coin land on s or tails, it becomes more surprising when it does not follow that pattern.

*   \**[00:05:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1Z3A6N5ck3c\&t=300)* Discusses how the scientific method is a faith that the future will behave like the past, and that this faith is based on evidence. It goes on to say that some thinkers in history suggested that the earth could be going around the sun, and that this was overturned through the use of evidence.  also discusses how flawed patterns in induction indicate that a scientific fact is not actually a fact, and that history is replete with examples of this. David Hume, a philosopher, mentioned this point in his work, History of England.
*   **[00:10:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1Z3A6N5ck3c\&t=600)** Karl Popper created falsification as a way of trying to disprove theories that are too sweeping or too vague. Richard Dawkins and Lawrence Krauss are examples of scientists who have a low IQ. Laplace explained that there is nothing random about the way balls scatter on a billiard table.
*   \**[00:15:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1Z3A6N5ck3c\&t=900)* Discusses the idea that randomness is an illusion, and that everything in the universe has a pattern that can be calculated. Laplace and other physicists believe that if a person reaches a certain level of understanding, they can become a philosopher.
*   \**[00:20:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1Z3A6N5ck3c\&t=1200)* Discusses the concept of randomness and how it does not exist in the universe. It then goes on to discuss the implications of this concept on the atheism vs. theism debate. It concludes by discussing how randomness can be a negative factor in communication.
*   **[00:25:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1Z3A6N5ck3c\&t=1500)** A philosopher and founder of the UFC (Ultimate Fighting Championship) discusses randomness, the universe, and God. He argues that there is no randomness in the universe, only patterns and regularities. He also says that man is not a measure of all things and that there is an independent truth outside of man.
*   **[00:30:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1Z3A6N5ck3c\&t=1800)**  UFC commentator and grappling coach Firas Zahabi discusses randomness and the universe. He claims that there is no logical explanation for why things exist, and that randomness is a figment of our imagination. Zahabi also discusses the theories of Newton and Einstein, and how their theories were later disproved. He argues that philosophy is a way to look at the world and understand our ignorance. He finishes the video by saying that the highest mountain we've ever seen is not necessarily the highest mountain, and that determinism is always a risk when discussing the existence of a multiverse.
*   **[00:35:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1Z3A6N5ck3c\&t=2100)** Firas Zahabi discusses determinism and free will in Islam, and how determinism and free will are related to one's experience. He also discusses how determinism can be applied to everyday life situations.
*   **[00:40:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1Z3A6N5ck3c\&t=2400)** Firas Zahabi discusses the concept of "harmony," which he says can be found in both the Quran and Islamic philosophy. He goes on to say that any seeming contradictions in Islam are due to our limited understanding, and that once we understand the concept of submission, we can live in peace.
*   \**[00:45:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1Z3A6N5ck3c\&t=2700)* Discusses the idea of free will and determinism, and how they can seem to be in conflict. However, when looked at more closely, it becomes clear that both concepts are actually part of a larger, interconnected philosophy. In the end, the video encourages viewers to subscribe to Frost's channel, which will provide them with a variety of quality content on a variety of topics.
*   **[00:50:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1Z3A6N5ck3c\&t=3000)** In this discussion with UFC's Firas Zahabi, the two discuss the concept of randomness, God, and the universe. Zahabi argues that randomness is an intrinsic part of the universe, and that without it, there would be no order or design. He also discusses the idea that there must be a higher power behind all of this, and that this power is ultimately responsible for creating and maintaining the universe.

[0:00:02](https://youtu.be/1Z3A6N5ck3c?t=2) with Roz I be the mastermind fights her\
[0:00:05](https://youtu.be/1Z3A6N5ck3c?t=5) but also but also the logician right\
[0:00:08](https://youtu.be/1Z3A6N5ck3c?t=8) also the people don't know about this\
[0:00:09](https://youtu.be/1Z3A6N5ck3c?t=9) point is he is the man who has the\
[0:00:12](https://youtu.be/1Z3A6N5ck3c?t=12) ability a theoretical and conceptual\
[0:00:13](https://youtu.be/1Z3A6N5ck3c?t=13) knowledge of that philosophy and logic\
[0:00:17](https://youtu.be/1Z3A6N5ck3c?t=17) and these things so we're gonna actually\
[0:00:19](https://youtu.be/1Z3A6N5ck3c?t=19) discuss randomness is really very\
[0:00:22](https://youtu.be/1Z3A6N5ck3c?t=22) powerful thing we for those who don't\
[0:00:25](https://youtu.be/1Z3A6N5ck3c?t=25) know I I have a degree in philosophy as\
[0:00:27](https://youtu.be/1Z3A6N5ck3c?t=27) well I graduated cord in philosophy and\
[0:00:29](https://youtu.be/1Z3A6N5ck3c?t=29) this was many years ago and for over I\
[0:00:31](https://youtu.be/1Z3A6N5ck3c?t=31) would say 20 years I've been studying\
[0:00:33](https://youtu.be/1Z3A6N5ck3c?t=33) philosophy very very closely and you\
[0:00:36](https://youtu.be/1Z3A6N5ck3c?t=36) know I hear the modern-day conversations\
[0:00:38](https://youtu.be/1Z3A6N5ck3c?t=38) and whatnot and mean I might become\
[0:00:40](https://youtu.be/1Z3A6N5ck3c?t=40) friends we've had a lot of nice\
[0:00:42](https://youtu.be/1Z3A6N5ck3c?t=42) discussions as well and and there are so\
[0:00:44](https://youtu.be/1Z3A6N5ck3c?t=44) many great thinkers in history you know\
[0:00:46](https://youtu.be/1Z3A6N5ck3c?t=46) so many great thinkers and and really\
[0:00:48](https://youtu.be/1Z3A6N5ck3c?t=48) the knowledge is out there it's just a\
[0:00:50](https://youtu.be/1Z3A6N5ck3c?t=50) it's a very difficult tedious type of\
[0:00:52](https://youtu.be/1Z3A6N5ck3c?t=52) knowledge to get to because you have to\
[0:00:53](https://youtu.be/1Z3A6N5ck3c?t=53) read a lot of books to get to this type\
[0:00:55](https://youtu.be/1Z3A6N5ck3c?t=55) of knowledge and to try to encapsulate\
[0:00:57](https://youtu.be/1Z3A6N5ck3c?t=57) all this and and of course you can never\
[0:00:59](https://youtu.be/1Z3A6N5ck3c?t=59) have more than 1% of knowledge so today\
[0:01:01](https://youtu.be/1Z3A6N5ck3c?t=61) well what we want to talk about today is\
[0:01:03](https://youtu.be/1Z3A6N5ck3c?t=63) really a very very important Epis tamal\
[0:01:06](https://youtu.be/1Z3A6N5ck3c?t=66) a piston piston biological excuse me\
[0:01:10](https://youtu.be/1Z3A6N5ck3c?t=70) yeah idea that's so profound that we\
[0:01:16](https://youtu.be/1Z3A6N5ck3c?t=76) have to put it in a simple simple way\
[0:01:18](https://youtu.be/1Z3A6N5ck3c?t=78) for people to understand and this is\
[0:01:19](https://youtu.be/1Z3A6N5ck3c?t=79) actually very important to this course\
[0:01:21](https://youtu.be/1Z3A6N5ck3c?t=81) because like a lot of people now\
[0:01:22](https://youtu.be/1Z3A6N5ck3c?t=82) especially with like atheist and theist\
[0:01:23](https://youtu.be/1Z3A6N5ck3c?t=83) discourse they bring the idea of\
[0:01:26](https://youtu.be/1Z3A6N5ck3c?t=86) randomness so if you ask a lot of people\
[0:01:28](https://youtu.be/1Z3A6N5ck3c?t=88) now eight years to otherwise do how did\
[0:01:31](https://youtu.be/1Z3A6N5ck3c?t=91) the universe come into existence they'll\
[0:01:32](https://youtu.be/1Z3A6N5ck3c?t=92) say well the universe was a random\
[0:01:34](https://youtu.be/1Z3A6N5ck3c?t=94) generation it came we just came into\
[0:01:36](https://youtu.be/1Z3A6N5ck3c?t=96) existence by random general by way of\
[0:01:38](https://youtu.be/1Z3A6N5ck3c?t=98) random generation and and the\
[0:01:41](https://youtu.be/1Z3A6N5ck3c?t=101) fine-tuning that we see around us is\
[0:01:43](https://youtu.be/1Z3A6N5ck3c?t=103) also a random generation or if they\
[0:01:46](https://youtu.be/1Z3A6N5ck3c?t=106) don't go through that route they'll say\
[0:01:47](https://youtu.be/1Z3A6N5ck3c?t=107) well it's random and they'll use that\
[0:01:49](https://youtu.be/1Z3A6N5ck3c?t=109) and the vernacular it's used in the\
[0:01:51](https://youtu.be/1Z3A6N5ck3c?t=111) vernacular kind of like to to explain\
[0:01:54](https://youtu.be/1Z3A6N5ck3c?t=114) processes that can't be explained really\
[0:01:56](https://youtu.be/1Z3A6N5ck3c?t=116) right a common misconception is well we\
[0:02:01](https://youtu.be/1Z3A6N5ck3c?t=121) have to understand there are three\
[0:02:01](https://youtu.be/1Z3A6N5ck3c?t=121) fundamental ways to know something yeah\
[0:02:04](https://youtu.be/1Z3A6N5ck3c?t=124) and we do have the thing in the back or\
[0:02:06](https://youtu.be/1Z3A6N5ck3c?t=126) speaking noise so there's three ways to\
[0:02:08](https://youtu.be/1Z3A6N5ck3c?t=128) know something okay you know something\
[0:02:09](https://youtu.be/1Z3A6N5ck3c?t=129) I'll put in simplest terms possible\
[0:02:11](https://youtu.be/1Z3A6N5ck3c?t=131) you know something mathematically or\
[0:02:13](https://youtu.be/1Z3A6N5ck3c?t=133) logic we can know something\
[0:02:15](https://youtu.be/1Z3A6N5ck3c?t=135) scientifically or empirically okay we\
[0:02:17](https://youtu.be/1Z3A6N5ck3c?t=137) can know something intuitively okay so\
[0:02:19](https://youtu.be/1Z3A6N5ck3c?t=139) these are three basic ways now putting\
[0:02:21](https://youtu.be/1Z3A6N5ck3c?t=141) all that aside all the jargon I like to\
[0:02:24](https://youtu.be/1Z3A6N5ck3c?t=144) start with thought experiments because\
[0:02:25](https://youtu.be/1Z3A6N5ck3c?t=145) thought experiments make complicated\
[0:02:27](https://youtu.be/1Z3A6N5ck3c?t=147) under lessons as simple as possible okay\
[0:02:30](https://youtu.be/1Z3A6N5ck3c?t=150) so we were talking about it earlier\
[0:02:31](https://youtu.be/1Z3A6N5ck3c?t=151) today and Mohamed wanted to record it so\
[0:02:33](https://youtu.be/1Z3A6N5ck3c?t=153) I think it's a great idea let's record\
[0:02:35](https://youtu.be/1Z3A6N5ck3c?t=155) and share it so this question asks you\
[0:02:37](https://youtu.be/1Z3A6N5ck3c?t=157) before yeah so you already know the\
[0:02:38](https://youtu.be/1Z3A6N5ck3c?t=158) answer to it okay but the question was\
[0:02:41](https://youtu.be/1Z3A6N5ck3c?t=161) if I were to flip a coin mmm okay I'm\
[0:02:44](https://youtu.be/1Z3A6N5ck3c?t=164) gonna flip a coin what are the odds that\
[0:02:47](https://youtu.be/1Z3A6N5ck3c?t=167) lands on heads fifty percent is the odds\
[0:02:51](https://youtu.be/1Z3A6N5ck3c?t=171) it lands on heads yeah the actual actual\
[0:02:55](https://youtu.be/1Z3A6N5ck3c?t=175) answer okay if you want to know the\
[0:02:58](https://youtu.be/1Z3A6N5ck3c?t=178) truth in an expression I like to use\
[0:03:00](https://youtu.be/1Z3A6N5ck3c?t=180) this capital T not everyday truth but\
[0:03:03](https://youtu.be/1Z3A6N5ck3c?t=183) the truth the actual truth literally\
[0:03:05](https://youtu.be/1Z3A6N5ck3c?t=185) literally speaking the big t you know\
[0:03:07](https://youtu.be/1Z3A6N5ck3c?t=187) the actual truth reality the odds are 1\
[0:03:10](https://youtu.be/1Z3A6N5ck3c?t=190) and infinity mm-hmm and when we say\
[0:03:13](https://youtu.be/1Z3A6N5ck3c?t=193) these people are gonna be like doesn't\
[0:03:14](https://youtu.be/1Z3A6N5ck3c?t=194) make any sense it's a very normal\
[0:03:16](https://youtu.be/1Z3A6N5ck3c?t=196) reaction now the reason why it's 1 in\
[0:03:18](https://youtu.be/1Z3A6N5ck3c?t=198) infinity is a little bit complicated but\
[0:03:20](https://youtu.be/1Z3A6N5ck3c?t=200) the truth is 1 in infinity now the\
[0:03:23](https://youtu.be/1Z3A6N5ck3c?t=203) reason why we say it's 5050 is because\
[0:03:26](https://youtu.be/1Z3A6N5ck3c?t=206) of our prior experience with coins it\
[0:03:29](https://youtu.be/1Z3A6N5ck3c?t=209) has nothing to do with logic so for\
[0:03:31](https://youtu.be/1Z3A6N5ck3c?t=211) instance if I wiped your memory here's a\
[0:03:34](https://youtu.be/1Z3A6N5ck3c?t=214) thought experiment I wipe your memory\
[0:03:35](https://youtu.be/1Z3A6N5ck3c?t=215) you have all your intelligence you have\
[0:03:37](https://youtu.be/1Z3A6N5ck3c?t=217) all your faculties and I flip a coin in\
[0:03:40](https://youtu.be/1Z3A6N5ck3c?t=220) front of you but this time it's the\
[0:03:41](https://youtu.be/1Z3A6N5ck3c?t=221) first time you see a coin being flipped\
[0:03:43](https://youtu.be/1Z3A6N5ck3c?t=223) and the coin I flip it and it turns into\
[0:03:46](https://youtu.be/1Z3A6N5ck3c?t=226) a butterfly it wouldn't be more\
[0:03:48](https://youtu.be/1Z3A6N5ck3c?t=228) surprising that it turned into a\
[0:03:49](https://youtu.be/1Z3A6N5ck3c?t=229) butterfly\
[0:03:50](https://youtu.be/1Z3A6N5ck3c?t=230) then if it landed on heads that's right\
[0:03:52](https://youtu.be/1Z3A6N5ck3c?t=232) because you have no memory of the first\
[0:03:54](https://youtu.be/1Z3A6N5ck3c?t=234) thing I've first encounter with that\
[0:03:56](https://youtu.be/1Z3A6N5ck3c?t=236) first encounter like for essence a child\
[0:03:58](https://youtu.be/1Z3A6N5ck3c?t=238) who sees a flame for the first time\
[0:04:00](https://youtu.be/1Z3A6N5ck3c?t=240) right he has no idea what's gonna happen\
[0:04:02](https://youtu.be/1Z3A6N5ck3c?t=242) when he touches it hmm as a matter of\
[0:04:04](https://youtu.be/1Z3A6N5ck3c?t=244) fact you could tell him a thousand times\
[0:04:05](https://youtu.be/1Z3A6N5ck3c?t=245) what's gonna happen he still doesn't\
[0:04:07](https://youtu.be/1Z3A6N5ck3c?t=247) understand you but when he touches it\
[0:04:09](https://youtu.be/1Z3A6N5ck3c?t=249) now he has an experience he has a\
[0:04:11](https://youtu.be/1Z3A6N5ck3c?t=251) history with flames\
[0:04:13](https://youtu.be/1Z3A6N5ck3c?t=253) and this is a very profound point\
[0:04:16](https://youtu.be/1Z3A6N5ck3c?t=256) because science science this scientific\
[0:04:19](https://youtu.be/1Z3A6N5ck3c?t=259) method we have today is really the\
[0:04:22](https://youtu.be/1Z3A6N5ck3c?t=262) observations of patterns and\
[0:04:24](https://youtu.be/1Z3A6N5ck3c?t=264) regularities found in nature returns and\
[0:04:26](https://youtu.be/1Z3A6N5ck3c?t=266) regularities found in nature\
[0:04:28](https://youtu.be/1Z3A6N5ck3c?t=268) yeah these patterns and regularities\
[0:04:31](https://youtu.be/1Z3A6N5ck3c?t=271) found in nature is what we call the\
[0:04:35](https://youtu.be/1Z3A6N5ck3c?t=275) science science so for instance when I\
[0:04:39](https://youtu.be/1Z3A6N5ck3c?t=279) flipped that coin I do it enough times\
[0:04:41](https://youtu.be/1Z3A6N5ck3c?t=281) it lands on heads it lands on tails it\
[0:04:44](https://youtu.be/1Z3A6N5ck3c?t=284) lands on heads it lands on yours\
[0:04:45](https://youtu.be/1Z3A6N5ck3c?t=285) developing a history or Divali\
[0:04:46](https://youtu.be/1Z3A6N5ck3c?t=286) developing a you're noticing a pattern\
[0:04:49](https://youtu.be/1Z3A6N5ck3c?t=289) going on it never turned into a\
[0:04:51](https://youtu.be/1Z3A6N5ck3c?t=291) butterfly it never disappeared it always\
[0:04:54](https://youtu.be/1Z3A6N5ck3c?t=294) did the same thing it either landed on\
[0:04:55](https://youtu.be/1Z3A6N5ck3c?t=295) tails or I landed on the head 50% of the\
[0:04:58](https://youtu.be/1Z3A6N5ck3c?t=298) time now that you've had this history\
[0:05:00](https://youtu.be/1Z3A6N5ck3c?t=300) with coins you have this pattern that\
[0:05:02](https://youtu.be/1Z3A6N5ck3c?t=302) you figured out you say next time you\
[0:05:05](https://youtu.be/1Z3A6N5ck3c?t=305) flip it I predict that the future will\
[0:05:08](https://youtu.be/1Z3A6N5ck3c?t=308) behave like the past mmm this is a\
[0:05:11](https://youtu.be/1Z3A6N5ck3c?t=311) scientific method scientific method is a\
[0:05:13](https://youtu.be/1Z3A6N5ck3c?t=313) faith that the future will behave like\
[0:05:16](https://youtu.be/1Z3A6N5ck3c?t=316) the past it's a faith it's based on\
[0:05:18](https://youtu.be/1Z3A6N5ck3c?t=318) faith that's really profound a lot of\
[0:05:21](https://youtu.be/1Z3A6N5ck3c?t=321) people that talk about science right I\
[0:05:23](https://youtu.be/1Z3A6N5ck3c?t=323) mean I think that the antithesis of\
[0:05:26](https://youtu.be/1Z3A6N5ck3c?t=326) science is faith correct if you don't\
[0:05:29](https://youtu.be/1Z3A6N5ck3c?t=329) have faith correct science is the\
[0:05:31](https://youtu.be/1Z3A6N5ck3c?t=331) opposition of faith it's like this\
[0:05:32](https://youtu.be/1Z3A6N5ck3c?t=332) knowledge is pure knowledge and what\
[0:05:35](https://youtu.be/1Z3A6N5ck3c?t=335) you're saying is actually science does\
[0:05:37](https://youtu.be/1Z3A6N5ck3c?t=337) require some kind of faith in science is\
[0:05:39](https://youtu.be/1Z3A6N5ck3c?t=339) a type of faith no I'll give you an\
[0:05:41](https://youtu.be/1Z3A6N5ck3c?t=341) example for those of you were jumping\
[0:05:42](https://youtu.be/1Z3A6N5ck3c?t=342) out of your seats and are furious I mean\
[0:05:44](https://youtu.be/1Z3A6N5ck3c?t=344) how mad are lovers of science we love\
[0:05:46](https://youtu.be/1Z3A6N5ck3c?t=346) science it's just but it's just one way\
[0:05:48](https://youtu.be/1Z3A6N5ck3c?t=348) of knowing something it's not the\
[0:05:49](https://youtu.be/1Z3A6N5ck3c?t=349) absolute truth if you only use the\
[0:05:53](https://youtu.be/1Z3A6N5ck3c?t=353) scientific method you will not get to\
[0:05:55](https://youtu.be/1Z3A6N5ck3c?t=355) the capital T the truth okay like I tell\
[0:05:58](https://youtu.be/1Z3A6N5ck3c?t=358) them how much science is popular because\
[0:05:59](https://youtu.be/1Z3A6N5ck3c?t=359) it fills our bellies with food it put\
[0:06:02](https://youtu.be/1Z3A6N5ck3c?t=362) gold in our safes it allows us to\
[0:06:04](https://youtu.be/1Z3A6N5ck3c?t=364) conquer our enemies it's a very\
[0:06:06](https://youtu.be/1Z3A6N5ck3c?t=366) practical practice it's very practical\
[0:06:11](https://youtu.be/1Z3A6N5ck3c?t=371) yeah a method of going about a life and\
[0:06:14](https://youtu.be/1Z3A6N5ck3c?t=374) it's important that's what we love\
[0:06:15](https://youtu.be/1Z3A6N5ck3c?t=375) science yeah we love our smart phones we\
[0:06:17](https://youtu.be/1Z3A6N5ck3c?t=377) love our modern medicine we're not\
[0:06:19](https://youtu.be/1Z3A6N5ck3c?t=379) against that yeah well when it comes to\
[0:06:20](https://youtu.be/1Z3A6N5ck3c?t=380) capital truth mm-hmm we have to inquire\
[0:06:24](https://youtu.be/1Z3A6N5ck3c?t=384) in the other realms we have to use logic\
[0:06:26](https://youtu.be/1Z3A6N5ck3c?t=386) and intuition\
[0:06:27](https://youtu.be/1Z3A6N5ck3c?t=387) as well it's a more complete\
[0:06:29](https://youtu.be/1Z3A6N5ck3c?t=389) understanding of what reality is now if\
[0:06:32](https://youtu.be/1Z3A6N5ck3c?t=392) people are not interested in reality the\
[0:06:33](https://youtu.be/1Z3A6N5ck3c?t=393) capital truth just turn off this video\
[0:06:35](https://youtu.be/1Z3A6N5ck3c?t=395) and go watch Kim Kardashian video maybe\
[0:06:37](https://youtu.be/1Z3A6N5ck3c?t=397) there's something else you know go get a\
[0:06:40](https://youtu.be/1Z3A6N5ck3c?t=400) financier whatever but this is up this\
[0:06:41](https://youtu.be/1Z3A6N5ck3c?t=401) is for people who are interested in\
[0:06:42](https://youtu.be/1Z3A6N5ck3c?t=402) realities itself and philosophers over\
[0:06:44](https://youtu.be/1Z3A6N5ck3c?t=404) many many millennia have discussed what\
[0:06:48](https://youtu.be/1Z3A6N5ck3c?t=408) is reality and the fascinating topic for\
[0:06:51](https://youtu.be/1Z3A6N5ck3c?t=411) those who are interested Wow no what\
[0:06:54](https://youtu.be/1Z3A6N5ck3c?t=414) were we saying about randomness tipping\
[0:06:56](https://youtu.be/1Z3A6N5ck3c?t=416) the corner so we flip the coin yep we\
[0:06:59](https://youtu.be/1Z3A6N5ck3c?t=419) create a pattern irregularity then we\
[0:07:00](https://youtu.be/1Z3A6N5ck3c?t=420) develop a faith that this pattern\
[0:07:02](https://youtu.be/1Z3A6N5ck3c?t=422) irregularity will stay up and one very\
[0:07:04](https://youtu.be/1Z3A6N5ck3c?t=424) common example one classic example is\
[0:07:06](https://youtu.be/1Z3A6N5ck3c?t=426) Aristotle brilliant man one of the\
[0:07:08](https://youtu.be/1Z3A6N5ck3c?t=428) smartest men that ever lived\
[0:07:10](https://youtu.be/1Z3A6N5ck3c?t=430) yeah and he would see the Sun go around\
[0:07:12](https://youtu.be/1Z3A6N5ck3c?t=432) the earth every day mmm and his\
[0:07:13](https://youtu.be/1Z3A6N5ck3c?t=433) ancestors told him that the Sun goes\
[0:07:15](https://youtu.be/1Z3A6N5ck3c?t=435) around the earth in their lifetime and\
[0:07:17](https://youtu.be/1Z3A6N5ck3c?t=437) that their forefathers told them that\
[0:07:18](https://youtu.be/1Z3A6N5ck3c?t=438) the Sun goes around the earth and that\
[0:07:20](https://youtu.be/1Z3A6N5ck3c?t=440) was a scientific observation found in\
[0:07:23](https://youtu.be/1Z3A6N5ck3c?t=443) nature done by countless people he said\
[0:07:26](https://youtu.be/1Z3A6N5ck3c?t=446) look the Sun goes around the earth it's\
[0:07:28](https://youtu.be/1Z3A6N5ck3c?t=448) a fact fast forward many years later\
[0:07:33](https://youtu.be/1Z3A6N5ck3c?t=453) some philosophers and thinkers started\
[0:07:35](https://youtu.be/1Z3A6N5ck3c?t=455) saying no no no no no no wait a second\
[0:07:37](https://youtu.be/1Z3A6N5ck3c?t=457) we object we think it's the earth going\
[0:07:39](https://youtu.be/1Z3A6N5ck3c?t=459) around the Sun mmm turns out it's an\
[0:07:42](https://youtu.be/1Z3A6N5ck3c?t=462) optical illusion those thinkers were\
[0:07:44](https://youtu.be/1Z3A6N5ck3c?t=464) correct Galileo and the bunch so many\
[0:07:46](https://youtu.be/1Z3A6N5ck3c?t=466) there's actually many great thinkers in\
[0:07:47](https://youtu.be/1Z3A6N5ck3c?t=467) history who suggested that maybe the\
[0:07:50](https://youtu.be/1Z3A6N5ck3c?t=470) earth is going around the Sun it's the\
[0:07:51](https://youtu.be/1Z3A6N5ck3c?t=471) opposite there's an optical illusion\
[0:07:53](https://youtu.be/1Z3A6N5ck3c?t=473) regardless a scientific fact was\
[0:07:55](https://youtu.be/1Z3A6N5ck3c?t=475) overturned\
[0:07:55](https://youtu.be/1Z3A6N5ck3c?t=475) now scientific facts are overturned\
[0:07:58](https://youtu.be/1Z3A6N5ck3c?t=478) throughout history yeah why optical\
[0:08:02](https://youtu.be/1Z3A6N5ck3c?t=482) illusions faulty patterns we made a\
[0:08:04](https://youtu.be/1Z3A6N5ck3c?t=484) mistake we thought a pattern was such\
[0:08:05](https://youtu.be/1Z3A6N5ck3c?t=485) and it wasn't yeah like for instance we\
[0:08:07](https://youtu.be/1Z3A6N5ck3c?t=487) used to think that all flamingos are\
[0:08:09](https://youtu.be/1Z3A6N5ck3c?t=489) pink and then we went to Australia and\
[0:08:11](https://youtu.be/1Z3A6N5ck3c?t=491) we found black flamingos and we turned\
[0:08:13](https://youtu.be/1Z3A6N5ck3c?t=493) out hateful mingoes or pink because of\
[0:08:14](https://youtu.be/1Z3A6N5ck3c?t=494) the food that they eat another\
[0:08:16](https://youtu.be/1Z3A6N5ck3c?t=496) scientific fact overturned a scientific\
[0:08:19](https://youtu.be/1Z3A6N5ck3c?t=499) fact can never actually literally\
[0:08:20](https://youtu.be/1Z3A6N5ck3c?t=500) literally be a fact as people will\
[0:08:24](https://youtu.be/1Z3A6N5ck3c?t=504) commonly understand the word fact okay a\
[0:08:26](https://youtu.be/1Z3A6N5ck3c?t=506) fact is what the consensus is what\
[0:08:28](https://youtu.be/1Z3A6N5ck3c?t=508) experts today agree upon that is a\
[0:08:31](https://youtu.be/1Z3A6N5ck3c?t=511) scientific fact is that's the same as\
[0:08:32](https://youtu.be/1Z3A6N5ck3c?t=512) I'm not a medical fact yeah\
[0:08:34](https://youtu.be/1Z3A6N5ck3c?t=514) so the problem of induction comes into\
[0:08:36](https://youtu.be/1Z3A6N5ck3c?t=516) it yeah the problem induction so a fact\
[0:08:39](https://youtu.be/1Z3A6N5ck3c?t=519) in science is really a high\
[0:08:40](https://youtu.be/1Z3A6N5ck3c?t=520) Baathists a very agreed-upon hypothesis\
[0:08:44](https://youtu.be/1Z3A6N5ck3c?t=524) now this is not an attack on science\
[0:08:45](https://youtu.be/1Z3A6N5ck3c?t=525) again we love science ok nothing wrong\
[0:08:48](https://youtu.be/1Z3A6N5ck3c?t=528) with science Isis beautiful thing we're\
[0:08:50](https://youtu.be/1Z3A6N5ck3c?t=530) just being honest about science and what\
[0:08:52](https://youtu.be/1Z3A6N5ck3c?t=532) is arts what are its strengths and\
[0:08:54](https://youtu.be/1Z3A6N5ck3c?t=534) weaknesses yeah is science absolute\
[0:08:57](https://youtu.be/1Z3A6N5ck3c?t=537) meaning if I follow the scientific\
[0:08:58](https://youtu.be/1Z3A6N5ck3c?t=538) method I will know the reality of the\
[0:09:00](https://youtu.be/1Z3A6N5ck3c?t=540) world as it is what is your opinion on\
[0:09:02](https://youtu.be/1Z3A6N5ck3c?t=542) this well because of the important\
[0:09:04](https://youtu.be/1Z3A6N5ck3c?t=544) production so as you've outlined\
[0:09:07](https://youtu.be/1Z3A6N5ck3c?t=547) crackling in the pole of induction\
[0:09:08](https://youtu.be/1Z3A6N5ck3c?t=548) indicates that with the flamingo example\
[0:09:11](https://youtu.be/1Z3A6N5ck3c?t=551) I think David Hume used the Swan\
[0:09:12](https://youtu.be/1Z3A6N5ck3c?t=552) examples like is it's not right\
[0:09:14](https://youtu.be/1Z3A6N5ck3c?t=554) Swan swimming go yeah so the idea of\
[0:09:17](https://youtu.be/1Z3A6N5ck3c?t=557) like having all of the the sample group\
[0:09:20](https://youtu.be/1Z3A6N5ck3c?t=560) the sample group can't be fully\
[0:09:22](https://youtu.be/1Z3A6N5ck3c?t=562) represented and for that reason we\
[0:09:24](https://youtu.be/1Z3A6N5ck3c?t=564) cannot assume that everything can be\
[0:09:28](https://youtu.be/1Z3A6N5ck3c?t=568) analyzed or and generalized that's one\
[0:09:30](https://youtu.be/1Z3A6N5ck3c?t=570) thing and the other thing is that like\
[0:09:31](https://youtu.be/1Z3A6N5ck3c?t=571) you were saying kind of links into what\
[0:09:33](https://youtu.be/1Z3A6N5ck3c?t=573) you were saying David Hume also\
[0:09:34](https://youtu.be/1Z3A6N5ck3c?t=574) mentioned this point which is the idea\
[0:09:35](https://youtu.be/1Z3A6N5ck3c?t=575) of history repeating itself we have to\
[0:09:37](https://youtu.be/1Z3A6N5ck3c?t=577) have the faith in that that's a\
[0:09:39](https://youtu.be/1Z3A6N5ck3c?t=579) presupposition in all of science you\
[0:09:42](https://youtu.be/1Z3A6N5ck3c?t=582) always have to have that faith yeah and\
[0:09:43](https://youtu.be/1Z3A6N5ck3c?t=583) then David Hume was very open about his\
[0:09:45](https://youtu.be/1Z3A6N5ck3c?t=585) phenomenon philosophy said look\
[0:09:47](https://youtu.be/1Z3A6N5ck3c?t=587) science is the faith that the hist\
[0:09:49](https://youtu.be/1Z3A6N5ck3c?t=589) history will repeat itself the future\
[0:09:52](https://youtu.be/1Z3A6N5ck3c?t=592) will behave like the past if the future\
[0:09:54](https://youtu.be/1Z3A6N5ck3c?t=594) for whatever reason doesn't behave like\
[0:09:55](https://youtu.be/1Z3A6N5ck3c?t=595) the past you know and you know Karl\
[0:10:00](https://youtu.be/1Z3A6N5ck3c?t=600) Popper he did eat a beautiful experiment\
[0:10:01](https://youtu.be/1Z3A6N5ck3c?t=601) to try to dis to try to fix this issue\
[0:10:04](https://youtu.be/1Z3A6N5ck3c?t=604) okay maybe that maybe that we're\
[0:10:06](https://youtu.be/1Z3A6N5ck3c?t=606) sidetracking won't talk about randomness\
[0:10:07](https://youtu.be/1Z3A6N5ck3c?t=607) but we all know so Karl Popper created\
[0:10:10](https://youtu.be/1Z3A6N5ck3c?t=610) falsification for those of you out there\
[0:10:11](https://youtu.be/1Z3A6N5ck3c?t=611) were familiar with Karl Popper but even\
[0:10:13](https://youtu.be/1Z3A6N5ck3c?t=613) that doesn't get around the problem it\
[0:10:14](https://youtu.be/1Z3A6N5ck3c?t=614) makes it better it brings us closer to\
[0:10:16](https://youtu.be/1Z3A6N5ck3c?t=616) the truth but it doesn't get around the\
[0:10:17](https://youtu.be/1Z3A6N5ck3c?t=617) problem so science is not absolute okay\
[0:10:20](https://youtu.be/1Z3A6N5ck3c?t=620) so that's number one\
[0:10:21](https://youtu.be/1Z3A6N5ck3c?t=621) yeah do scientists like Richard Dawkins\
[0:10:23](https://youtu.be/1Z3A6N5ck3c?t=623) and Lawrence Krauss do they know this\
[0:10:25](https://youtu.be/1Z3A6N5ck3c?t=625) they know it the day in my opinion from\
[0:10:28](https://youtu.be/1Z3A6N5ck3c?t=628) hearing them talk they're there they\
[0:10:30](https://youtu.be/1Z3A6N5ck3c?t=630) don't understand adduction and intuition\
[0:10:32](https://youtu.be/1Z3A6N5ck3c?t=632) they don't understand other types of\
[0:10:33](https://youtu.be/1Z3A6N5ck3c?t=633) logic and I've heard them say very\
[0:10:35](https://youtu.be/1Z3A6N5ck3c?t=635) illogical things and then David\
[0:10:37](https://youtu.be/1Z3A6N5ck3c?t=637) Berlinski a philosopher a PhD when he\
[0:10:40](https://youtu.be/1Z3A6N5ck3c?t=640) commented on Richard Dawkins he says\
[0:10:41](https://youtu.be/1Z3A6N5ck3c?t=641) looking Richard Dawkins is a crummy\
[0:10:43](https://youtu.be/1Z3A6N5ck3c?t=643) philosopher to use his words and he even\
[0:10:45](https://youtu.be/1Z3A6N5ck3c?t=645) said he's a reptile of a human being\
[0:10:48](https://youtu.be/1Z3A6N5ck3c?t=648) devar olinsky's a PhD in mathematics and\
[0:10:51](https://youtu.be/1Z3A6N5ck3c?t=651) philosophy he understands logic and\
[0:10:53](https://youtu.be/1Z3A6N5ck3c?t=653) reason and he understands science very\
[0:10:55](https://youtu.be/1Z3A6N5ck3c?t=655) well yeah he's a he's a very learned man\
[0:10:57](https://youtu.be/1Z3A6N5ck3c?t=657) and I put Hold'em to be much more\
[0:10:59](https://youtu.be/1Z3A6N5ck3c?t=659) learner than a Richard Dawkins like Kant\
[0:11:01](https://youtu.be/1Z3A6N5ck3c?t=661) says and this is this is carrots worth\
[0:11:04](https://youtu.be/1Z3A6N5ck3c?t=664) not my words he says look Sciences are\
[0:11:06](https://youtu.be/1Z3A6N5ck3c?t=666) not necessarily smart they follow a\
[0:11:07](https://youtu.be/1Z3A6N5ck3c?t=667) formula they follow a method hmm yes\
[0:11:11](https://youtu.be/1Z3A6N5ck3c?t=671) they're smart to interpret the data etc\
[0:11:12](https://youtu.be/1Z3A6N5ck3c?t=672) the average physicists IQ is about 130\
[0:11:15](https://youtu.be/1Z3A6N5ck3c?t=675) yeah an average physic he was 130 now\
[0:11:18](https://youtu.be/1Z3A6N5ck3c?t=678) just average it's mono 130 is very high\
[0:11:22](https://youtu.be/1Z3A6N5ck3c?t=682) 132 is genius\
[0:11:24](https://youtu.be/1Z3A6N5ck3c?t=684) okay there's all right there's smart\
[0:11:26](https://youtu.be/1Z3A6N5ck3c?t=686) people but if we're talking about the\
[0:11:28](https://youtu.be/1Z3A6N5ck3c?t=688) Giants of intelligence okay there they\
[0:11:30](https://youtu.be/1Z3A6N5ck3c?t=690) were you know we have some people we\
[0:11:31](https://youtu.be/1Z3A6N5ck3c?t=691) estimate them by consensus and the\
[0:11:34](https://youtu.be/1Z3A6N5ck3c?t=694) psychologist was to me they're 200 or\
[0:11:36](https://youtu.be/1Z3A6N5ck3c?t=696) 170 or one think this is another world\
[0:11:38](https://youtu.be/1Z3A6N5ck3c?t=698) okay\
[0:11:38](https://youtu.be/1Z3A6N5ck3c?t=698) 140 is another world 150 is another\
[0:11:41](https://youtu.be/1Z3A6N5ck3c?t=701) world and there are people today alive\
[0:11:42](https://youtu.be/1Z3A6N5ck3c?t=702) and score 190 I mean this is another\
[0:11:45](https://youtu.be/1Z3A6N5ck3c?t=705) world of IQ but IQ is not necessarily\
[0:11:48](https://youtu.be/1Z3A6N5ck3c?t=708) fully IQ like I was talking to telling\
[0:11:52](https://youtu.be/1Z3A6N5ck3c?t=712) you today IQ would be like your\
[0:11:54](https://youtu.be/1Z3A6N5ck3c?t=714) athleticism hmm doesn't mean the best\
[0:11:55](https://youtu.be/1Z3A6N5ck3c?t=715) athlete is the best fighter or the best\
[0:11:57](https://youtu.be/1Z3A6N5ck3c?t=717) boxer he has the potential to be really\
[0:12:00](https://youtu.be/1Z3A6N5ck3c?t=720) good at the sport\
[0:12:01](https://youtu.be/1Z3A6N5ck3c?t=721) hmm but you could be a lesser athlete\
[0:12:03](https://youtu.be/1Z3A6N5ck3c?t=723) and have a better jiu-jitsu a wrestling\
[0:12:05](https://youtu.be/1Z3A6N5ck3c?t=725) ability than a better athlete it happens\
[0:12:06](https://youtu.be/1Z3A6N5ck3c?t=726) all the time\
[0:12:06](https://youtu.be/1Z3A6N5ck3c?t=726) okay so let's not put i q-- above all\
[0:12:09](https://youtu.be/1Z3A6N5ck3c?t=729) it's not it's a factor and many studies\
[0:12:11](https://youtu.be/1Z3A6N5ck3c?t=731) have proven that over and over again but\
[0:12:13](https://youtu.be/1Z3A6N5ck3c?t=733) I don't want to go into a tangent we're\
[0:12:15](https://youtu.be/1Z3A6N5ck3c?t=735) talking about random randomness I think\
[0:12:18](https://youtu.be/1Z3A6N5ck3c?t=738) is the most misunderstood concept in the\
[0:12:22](https://youtu.be/1Z3A6N5ck3c?t=742) history of Western science okay and a\
[0:12:25](https://youtu.be/1Z3A6N5ck3c?t=745) man by the name of Laplace I believe was\
[0:12:28](https://youtu.be/1Z3A6N5ck3c?t=748) Jean Pierre Laplace mm-hmm he was a\
[0:12:30](https://youtu.be/1Z3A6N5ck3c?t=750) physicist and a time of Sir Isaac Newton\
[0:12:32](https://youtu.be/1Z3A6N5ck3c?t=752) he was a successor to Sir Isaac Newton\
[0:12:34](https://youtu.be/1Z3A6N5ck3c?t=754) Sir Isaac Newton completely outshined\
[0:12:36](https://youtu.be/1Z3A6N5ck3c?t=756) him we all know that name Sir Isaac\
[0:12:38](https://youtu.be/1Z3A6N5ck3c?t=758) Newton the Laplace did some phenomenal\
[0:12:39](https://youtu.be/1Z3A6N5ck3c?t=759) work but he was just the scottie pippen\
[0:12:42](https://youtu.be/1Z3A6N5ck3c?t=762) of Michael Jordan you know Scottie\
[0:12:43](https://youtu.be/1Z3A6N5ck3c?t=763) Pippen was great yeah but Michael Jordan\
[0:12:45](https://youtu.be/1Z3A6N5ck3c?t=765) was just the greatest of all time right\
[0:12:47](https://youtu.be/1Z3A6N5ck3c?t=767) okay and we can argue that quite easily\
[0:12:50](https://youtu.be/1Z3A6N5ck3c?t=770) actually we can argue that Isaac Newton\
[0:12:53](https://youtu.be/1Z3A6N5ck3c?t=773) was the greatest scientist of all time\
[0:12:54](https://youtu.be/1Z3A6N5ck3c?t=774) scientists of all time not philosophers\
[0:12:56](https://youtu.be/1Z3A6N5ck3c?t=776) but scientists\
[0:12:57](https://youtu.be/1Z3A6N5ck3c?t=777) and Laplace was this outshine it just\
[0:13:00](https://youtu.be/1Z3A6N5ck3c?t=780) happened so happened to be okay and\
[0:13:01](https://youtu.be/1Z3A6N5ck3c?t=781) Laplace explained something so wonderful\
[0:13:03](https://youtu.be/1Z3A6N5ck3c?t=783) so so deep so profound that that it\
[0:13:08](https://youtu.be/1Z3A6N5ck3c?t=788) bears mentioning in this video he says\
[0:13:10](https://youtu.be/1Z3A6N5ck3c?t=790) look look at a billiard ball table look\
[0:13:11](https://youtu.be/1Z3A6N5ck3c?t=791) at the the balls on a pool table you\
[0:13:14](https://youtu.be/1Z3A6N5ck3c?t=794) guys say pool here yeah billiard balls\
[0:13:16](https://youtu.be/1Z3A6N5ck3c?t=796) yeah so I break the billiard balls yeah\
[0:13:19](https://youtu.be/1Z3A6N5ck3c?t=799) and there are two people watching the\
[0:13:22](https://youtu.be/1Z3A6N5ck3c?t=802) the break one is a physicist and one is\
[0:13:26](https://youtu.be/1Z3A6N5ck3c?t=806) everyday person and everyday person said\
[0:13:28](https://youtu.be/1Z3A6N5ck3c?t=808) look I'm gonna break it the balls are\
[0:13:30](https://youtu.be/1Z3A6N5ck3c?t=810) gonna scatter randomly the physicist is\
[0:13:32](https://youtu.be/1Z3A6N5ck3c?t=812) gonna say no mm-hmm tell me how you're\
[0:13:34](https://youtu.be/1Z3A6N5ck3c?t=814) gonna hit it that what angle that what\
[0:13:36](https://youtu.be/1Z3A6N5ck3c?t=816) force and I'll tell you where every ball\
[0:13:37](https://youtu.be/1Z3A6N5ck3c?t=817) is gonna be there's nothing random about\
[0:13:39](https://youtu.be/1Z3A6N5ck3c?t=819) this and when you tell them all I'm\
[0:13:42](https://youtu.be/1Z3A6N5ck3c?t=822) gonna hit it this hard at this angle\
[0:13:44](https://youtu.be/1Z3A6N5ck3c?t=824) he'll take that table Laplace will take\
[0:13:47](https://youtu.be/1Z3A6N5ck3c?t=827) that table the physicists will take that\
[0:13:49](https://youtu.be/1Z3A6N5ck3c?t=829) table he'll turn it to a mathematical\
[0:13:50](https://youtu.be/1Z3A6N5ck3c?t=830) equation hmm and then he will tell you\
[0:13:53](https://youtu.be/1Z3A6N5ck3c?t=833) where every single ball is gonna be on\
[0:13:55](https://youtu.be/1Z3A6N5ck3c?t=835) the table and with perfect accuracy\
[0:13:57](https://youtu.be/1Z3A6N5ck3c?t=837) except with a tiny error with a tiny\
[0:14:00](https://youtu.be/1Z3A6N5ck3c?t=840) he'll be off by a very small margin and\
[0:14:02](https://youtu.be/1Z3A6N5ck3c?t=842) Laplace says I'll be off by a very small\
[0:14:05](https://youtu.be/1Z3A6N5ck3c?t=845) margin only because I have to round up\
[0:14:08](https://youtu.be/1Z3A6N5ck3c?t=848) the numbers I have to round off the\
[0:14:10](https://youtu.be/1Z3A6N5ck3c?t=850) numbers hmm he says I don't have a\
[0:14:12](https://youtu.be/1Z3A6N5ck3c?t=852) divine calculator if I had a divine\
[0:14:14](https://youtu.be/1Z3A6N5ck3c?t=854) calculator and I didn't round out with\
[0:14:16](https://youtu.be/1Z3A6N5ck3c?t=856) perfect I would tell you exactly to the\
[0:14:20](https://youtu.be/1Z3A6N5ck3c?t=860) smallest degree exactly where each ball\
[0:14:22](https://youtu.be/1Z3A6N5ck3c?t=862) is gonna land now why he's gonna\
[0:14:24](https://youtu.be/1Z3A6N5ck3c?t=864) calculate the friction of the table is\
[0:14:25](https://youtu.be/1Z3A6N5ck3c?t=865) gonna calculate the ball the weight of\
[0:14:27](https://youtu.be/1Z3A6N5ck3c?t=867) the ball he's gonna calculate the angle\
[0:14:28](https://youtu.be/1Z3A6N5ck3c?t=868) he's gonna calculate the density of the\
[0:14:30](https://youtu.be/1Z3A6N5ck3c?t=870) pool bands the bands he's gonna\
[0:14:32](https://youtu.be/1Z3A6N5ck3c?t=872) calculate everything and turn into\
[0:14:33](https://youtu.be/1Z3A6N5ck3c?t=873) mathematics mm-hmm and those mathematics\
[0:14:36](https://youtu.be/1Z3A6N5ck3c?t=876) are sure there's nothing unsure and\
[0:14:39](https://youtu.be/1Z3A6N5ck3c?t=879) Laplace says gives me an atom in your\
[0:14:42](https://youtu.be/1Z3A6N5ck3c?t=882) hand give me its coordinates in its\
[0:14:44](https://youtu.be/1Z3A6N5ck3c?t=884) velocity hmm and I'll tell you where\
[0:14:46](https://youtu.be/1Z3A6N5ck3c?t=886) it's gonna be in five years from now now\
[0:14:49](https://youtu.be/1Z3A6N5ck3c?t=889) many of you might be like oh this makes\
[0:14:50](https://youtu.be/1Z3A6N5ck3c?t=890) no sense it's perfectly sensible if you\
[0:14:53](https://youtu.be/1Z3A6N5ck3c?t=893) understand physics\
[0:14:55](https://youtu.be/1Z3A6N5ck3c?t=895) you understand that he is saying\
[0:14:56](https://youtu.be/1Z3A6N5ck3c?t=896) something 100% true hmm so what you're\
[0:15:00](https://youtu.be/1Z3A6N5ck3c?t=900) saying here is that randomness is just\
[0:15:03](https://youtu.be/1Z3A6N5ck3c?t=903) an excuse for people to describe\
[0:15:05](https://youtu.be/1Z3A6N5ck3c?t=905) something which they can't just what\
[0:15:07](https://youtu.be/1Z3A6N5ck3c?t=907) they can't explain when something is too\
[0:15:09](https://youtu.be/1Z3A6N5ck3c?t=909) chaotic for us meaning we cannot compute\
[0:15:11](https://youtu.be/1Z3A6N5ck3c?t=911) all the factors we use an expression\
[0:15:14](https://youtu.be/1Z3A6N5ck3c?t=914) saying randomness you know how they say\
[0:15:16](https://youtu.be/1Z3A6N5ck3c?t=916) well when somebody says randomness what\
[0:15:19](https://youtu.be/1Z3A6N5ck3c?t=919) they're really saying is look I am NOT\
[0:15:21](https://youtu.be/1Z3A6N5ck3c?t=921) able to compute all this information I\
[0:15:23](https://youtu.be/1Z3A6N5ck3c?t=923) have lost track of all the factors the\
[0:15:26](https://youtu.be/1Z3A6N5ck3c?t=926) way I expressed that as I say the word\
[0:15:28](https://youtu.be/1Z3A6N5ck3c?t=928) randomness Laplace said when God sees\
[0:15:32](https://youtu.be/1Z3A6N5ck3c?t=932) the world he doesn't see any randomness\
[0:15:33](https://youtu.be/1Z3A6N5ck3c?t=933) obviously yeah God sees the future past\
[0:15:36](https://youtu.be/1Z3A6N5ck3c?t=936) and present at once he knows every\
[0:15:38](https://youtu.be/1Z3A6N5ck3c?t=938) single and he was saying this because if\
[0:15:41](https://youtu.be/1Z3A6N5ck3c?t=941) you understand the divine mind obviously\
[0:15:44](https://youtu.be/1Z3A6N5ck3c?t=944) nothing is random there would be no\
[0:15:46](https://youtu.be/1Z3A6N5ck3c?t=946) randomness so randomness is a personal\
[0:15:47](https://youtu.be/1Z3A6N5ck3c?t=947) experience and a reflection of our\
[0:15:50](https://youtu.be/1Z3A6N5ck3c?t=950) ignorance so for instance two people are\
[0:15:55](https://youtu.be/1Z3A6N5ck3c?t=955) watching the pool balls be hit yes one\
[0:15:59](https://youtu.be/1Z3A6N5ck3c?t=959) of them is a physicist he's telling you\
[0:16:00](https://youtu.be/1Z3A6N5ck3c?t=960) look the ball is gonna land right here\
[0:16:02](https://youtu.be/1Z3A6N5ck3c?t=962) yes the layman is telling you know it's\
[0:16:04](https://youtu.be/1Z3A6N5ck3c?t=964) gonna randomly scatter all over which\
[0:16:07](https://youtu.be/1Z3A6N5ck3c?t=967) one is correct the physicist is correct\
[0:16:09](https://youtu.be/1Z3A6N5ck3c?t=969) hmm the layman is incorrect but he\
[0:16:14](https://youtu.be/1Z3A6N5ck3c?t=974) believes there's a randomness to the to\
[0:16:15](https://youtu.be/1Z3A6N5ck3c?t=975) the brain only because they don't\
[0:16:16](https://youtu.be/1Z3A6N5ck3c?t=976) understand the patent only because of\
[0:16:18](https://youtu.be/1Z3A6N5ck3c?t=978) ignorance so anytime we see we say\
[0:16:21](https://youtu.be/1Z3A6N5ck3c?t=981) random this you don't understand the fan\
[0:16:22](https://youtu.be/1Z3A6N5ck3c?t=982) see I believe that certain things happen\
[0:16:25](https://youtu.be/1Z3A6N5ck3c?t=985) in the universe yes but not at random I\
[0:16:27](https://youtu.be/1Z3A6N5ck3c?t=987) don't accept randomness randomness is\
[0:16:30](https://youtu.be/1Z3A6N5ck3c?t=990) just you throwing in the towel saying\
[0:16:31](https://youtu.be/1Z3A6N5ck3c?t=991) look I cannot compute where randomness\
[0:16:35](https://youtu.be/1Z3A6N5ck3c?t=995) is an illusion it's a figment of the\
[0:16:37](https://youtu.be/1Z3A6N5ck3c?t=997) imagination not according to me\
[0:16:39](https://youtu.be/1Z3A6N5ck3c?t=999) according to Laplace and physicists who\
[0:16:42](https://youtu.be/1Z3A6N5ck3c?t=1002) turn philosophers I believe if you could\
[0:16:44](https://youtu.be/1Z3A6N5ck3c?t=1004) reach a certain level of reflection on\
[0:16:46](https://youtu.be/1Z3A6N5ck3c?t=1006) physics that you become a philosopher\
[0:16:47](https://youtu.be/1Z3A6N5ck3c?t=1007) that's what a PhD is supposed to be you\
[0:16:51](https://youtu.be/1Z3A6N5ck3c?t=1011) reach this level where now you're not\
[0:16:52](https://youtu.be/1Z3A6N5ck3c?t=1012) just thinking about the particulars you\
[0:16:53](https://youtu.be/1Z3A6N5ck3c?t=1013) are thinking about what we call the\
[0:16:55](https://youtu.be/1Z3A6N5ck3c?t=1015) universals long story short there is no\
[0:16:58](https://youtu.be/1Z3A6N5ck3c?t=1018) such thing as randomness if there is if\
[0:17:00](https://youtu.be/1Z3A6N5ck3c?t=1020) it's natural selection by means of\
[0:17:04](https://youtu.be/1Z3A6N5ck3c?t=1024) random mutation I disagree if you tell\
[0:17:07](https://youtu.be/1Z3A6N5ck3c?t=1027) me it's natural selection by by means of\
[0:17:09](https://youtu.be/1Z3A6N5ck3c?t=1029) mutation I possibly agree if you can\
[0:17:11](https://youtu.be/1Z3A6N5ck3c?t=1031) prove me that but randomness I cannot\
[0:17:13](https://youtu.be/1Z3A6N5ck3c?t=1033) agree so this brings us to what would a\
[0:17:19](https://youtu.be/1Z3A6N5ck3c?t=1039) random world really look like we go back\
[0:17:22](https://youtu.be/1Z3A6N5ck3c?t=1042) to the coin experience okay this isn't\
[0:17:24](https://youtu.be/1Z3A6N5ck3c?t=1044) this is interesting yeah so what you're\
[0:17:26](https://youtu.be/1Z3A6N5ck3c?t=1046) saying here just to kind of summarize\
[0:17:27](https://youtu.be/1Z3A6N5ck3c?t=1047) some time if I've got this right what\
[0:17:29](https://youtu.be/1Z3A6N5ck3c?t=1049) you're saying here is that with the\
[0:17:31](https://youtu.be/1Z3A6N5ck3c?t=1051) whole pool example that if a layman saw\
[0:17:36](https://youtu.be/1Z3A6N5ck3c?t=1056) what was going on right they would see\
[0:17:38](https://youtu.be/1Z3A6N5ck3c?t=1058) that they would see that as seemingly a\
[0:17:39](https://youtu.be/1Z3A6N5ck3c?t=1059) random experiment right because they're\
[0:17:42](https://youtu.be/1Z3A6N5ck3c?t=1062) just seeing things moving around in a\
[0:17:45](https://youtu.be/1Z3A6N5ck3c?t=1065) haphazard way and they're computing that\
[0:17:47](https://youtu.be/1Z3A6N5ck3c?t=1067) as something they can't comprehend or\
[0:17:49](https://youtu.be/1Z3A6N5ck3c?t=1069) otherwise wouldn't be able to anticipate\
[0:17:51](https://youtu.be/1Z3A6N5ck3c?t=1071) in a normal situation and so they've\
[0:17:53](https://youtu.be/1Z3A6N5ck3c?t=1073) labeled that as random they labeled an\
[0:17:56](https://youtu.be/1Z3A6N5ck3c?t=1076) onion but what you're saying is now if\
[0:18:00](https://youtu.be/1Z3A6N5ck3c?t=1080) you think about it everything does have\
[0:18:02](https://youtu.be/1Z3A6N5ck3c?t=1082) a measurement and has a pattern and just\
[0:18:05](https://youtu.be/1Z3A6N5ck3c?t=1085) because we don't understand that\
[0:18:06](https://youtu.be/1Z3A6N5ck3c?t=1086) measurement or that pattern all that law\
[0:18:07](https://youtu.be/1Z3A6N5ck3c?t=1087) you could even say it doesn't mean that\
[0:18:09](https://youtu.be/1Z3A6N5ck3c?t=1089) that would be random is that I could say\
[0:18:11](https://youtu.be/1Z3A6N5ck3c?t=1091) you could understand it but you're not\
[0:18:13](https://youtu.be/1Z3A6N5ck3c?t=1093) able to compute it you'll have a divine\
[0:18:14](https://youtu.be/1Z3A6N5ck3c?t=1094) calculator but you're not able to make\
[0:18:16](https://youtu.be/1Z3A6N5ck3c?t=1096) the equations yeah because they're too\
[0:18:19](https://youtu.be/1Z3A6N5ck3c?t=1099) complicated there's too many things to\
[0:18:20](https://youtu.be/1Z3A6N5ck3c?t=1100) factor in yeah you might understand the\
[0:18:23](https://youtu.be/1Z3A6N5ck3c?t=1103) laws of physics thoroughly but there's\
[0:18:25](https://youtu.be/1Z3A6N5ck3c?t=1105) just too much information for you to\
[0:18:26](https://youtu.be/1Z3A6N5ck3c?t=1106) compute yeah so if I make the universe\
[0:18:29](https://youtu.be/1Z3A6N5ck3c?t=1109) into a billiard ball table now it's\
[0:18:31](https://youtu.be/1Z3A6N5ck3c?t=1111) controllable and now you can compute\
[0:18:33](https://youtu.be/1Z3A6N5ck3c?t=1113) yeah now Laplace was saying is look all\
[0:18:37](https://youtu.be/1Z3A6N5ck3c?t=1117) the chemicals in your brain the chemical\
[0:18:39](https://youtu.be/1Z3A6N5ck3c?t=1119) reactions are in thoughts these are all\
[0:18:41](https://youtu.be/1Z3A6N5ck3c?t=1121) little billiard balls so to speak it's\
[0:18:43](https://youtu.be/1Z3A6N5ck3c?t=1123) an expression we use\
[0:18:44](https://youtu.be/1Z3A6N5ck3c?t=1124) yeah it's matter pushing on matter we\
[0:18:47](https://youtu.be/1Z3A6N5ck3c?t=1127) say in physics they say in physics that\
[0:18:49](https://youtu.be/1Z3A6N5ck3c?t=1129) the cause of line is complete what does\
[0:18:51](https://youtu.be/1Z3A6N5ck3c?t=1131) that mean that the cause of line is\
[0:18:53](https://youtu.be/1Z3A6N5ck3c?t=1133) complete meaning that everything that\
[0:18:55](https://youtu.be/1Z3A6N5ck3c?t=1135) happens in physics everything happens in\
[0:18:57](https://youtu.be/1Z3A6N5ck3c?t=1137) the world you were living in today was\
[0:19:00](https://youtu.be/1Z3A6N5ck3c?t=1140) little tiny billiard balls so to speak\
[0:19:02](https://youtu.be/1Z3A6N5ck3c?t=1142) hitting one well this is an expression\
[0:19:04](https://youtu.be/1Z3A6N5ck3c?t=1144) okay we use okay is to say that there's\
[0:19:07](https://youtu.be/1Z3A6N5ck3c?t=1147) an interesting opinion yes it's to say\
[0:19:10](https://youtu.be/1Z3A6N5ck3c?t=1150) that the dominoes let's say you have a\
[0:19:12](https://youtu.be/1Z3A6N5ck3c?t=1152) hundred dominoes right and yeah you\
[0:19:14](https://youtu.be/1Z3A6N5ck3c?t=1154) number the dominoes one to a hundred yes\
[0:19:16](https://youtu.be/1Z3A6N5ck3c?t=1156) and then you saw a gap you\
[0:19:17](https://youtu.be/1Z3A6N5ck3c?t=1157) a gap so nominal 55 56 57 is missing and\
[0:19:22](https://youtu.be/1Z3A6N5ck3c?t=1162) you knock down them in a1 and hits\
[0:19:24](https://youtu.be/1Z3A6N5ck3c?t=1164) Domino 54 yeah and then Domino 58 58\
[0:19:29](https://youtu.be/1Z3A6N5ck3c?t=1169) falls over and there was a gap hmm\
[0:19:31](https://youtu.be/1Z3A6N5ck3c?t=1171) they're saying there's no such gap the\
[0:19:34](https://youtu.be/1Z3A6N5ck3c?t=1174) dominoes are perfect we can compute\
[0:19:35](https://youtu.be/1Z3A6N5ck3c?t=1175) there's nothing there's nothing\
[0:19:36](https://youtu.be/1Z3A6N5ck3c?t=1176) mysterious about what's going on physics\
[0:19:39](https://youtu.be/1Z3A6N5ck3c?t=1179) is there we can read the situation\
[0:19:41](https://youtu.be/1Z3A6N5ck3c?t=1181) clearly there is this Laplace was saying\
[0:19:43](https://youtu.be/1Z3A6N5ck3c?t=1183) there is no randomness whatsoever the\
[0:19:48](https://youtu.be/1Z3A6N5ck3c?t=1188) the the dominoes are there we can\
[0:19:50](https://youtu.be/1Z3A6N5ck3c?t=1190) calculate them the reason we cannot\
[0:19:52](https://youtu.be/1Z3A6N5ck3c?t=1192) calculate them we cannot calculate the\
[0:19:54](https://youtu.be/1Z3A6N5ck3c?t=1194) weather or what not is because it's too\
[0:19:56](https://youtu.be/1Z3A6N5ck3c?t=1196) complex for us to compute all the\
[0:19:58](https://youtu.be/1Z3A6N5ck3c?t=1198) factors hmm hypothetically theoretically\
[0:20:01](https://youtu.be/1Z3A6N5ck3c?t=1201) it is 100% possible hmm so so you're\
[0:20:06](https://youtu.be/1Z3A6N5ck3c?t=1206) asking about the world if it was\
[0:20:08](https://youtu.be/1Z3A6N5ck3c?t=1208) actually ready to actually ran right\
[0:20:10](https://youtu.be/1Z3A6N5ck3c?t=1210) yeah so and I flipped that coin yeah one\
[0:20:16](https://youtu.be/1Z3A6N5ck3c?t=1216) time we would turn into a butterfly\
[0:20:17](https://youtu.be/1Z3A6N5ck3c?t=1217) one time we would turn into a bird one\
[0:20:19](https://youtu.be/1Z3A6N5ck3c?t=1219) time we would turn into an ice cube one\
[0:20:21](https://youtu.be/1Z3A6N5ck3c?t=1221) time it would vanish it would act\
[0:20:23](https://youtu.be/1Z3A6N5ck3c?t=1223) randomly completely haphazardly that\
[0:20:27](https://youtu.be/1Z3A6N5ck3c?t=1227) would be true randomness the fact that\
[0:20:29](https://youtu.be/1Z3A6N5ck3c?t=1229) it lands on you know there they make\
[0:20:31](https://youtu.be/1Z3A6N5ck3c?t=1231) little robots you know that to prove\
[0:20:32](https://youtu.be/1Z3A6N5ck3c?t=1232) this I sent you this video once upon a\
[0:20:35](https://youtu.be/1Z3A6N5ck3c?t=1235) time I don't know if you remember\
[0:20:35](https://youtu.be/1Z3A6N5ck3c?t=1235) there's actual robots that can flip a\
[0:20:38](https://youtu.be/1Z3A6N5ck3c?t=1238) coin with 100% accuracy did you know\
[0:20:41](https://youtu.be/1Z3A6N5ck3c?t=1241) whether they flip and what happens they\
[0:20:43](https://youtu.be/1Z3A6N5ck3c?t=1243) flip a coin and you could set a robot to\
[0:20:46](https://youtu.be/1Z3A6N5ck3c?t=1246) flip the coin two heads or tails and\
[0:20:47](https://youtu.be/1Z3A6N5ck3c?t=1247) it'll flip it 30 40 times in the air and\
[0:20:50](https://youtu.be/1Z3A6N5ck3c?t=1250) they know the the machine knows how much\
[0:20:53](https://youtu.be/1Z3A6N5ck3c?t=1253) the coin weighs it knows the dog and it\
[0:20:55](https://youtu.be/1Z3A6N5ck3c?t=1255) knows how to bring it it throws the coin\
[0:20:57](https://youtu.be/1Z3A6N5ck3c?t=1257) in the air and the coin will land on\
[0:20:59](https://youtu.be/1Z3A6N5ck3c?t=1259) heads 100 percent of the time not 99.9\
[0:21:02](https://youtu.be/1Z3A6N5ck3c?t=1262) these machines exist it was to prove the\
[0:21:05](https://youtu.be/1Z3A6N5ck3c?t=1265) laplacian theory hmm then look these\
[0:21:08](https://youtu.be/1Z3A6N5ck3c?t=1268) robots are flipping coins and these\
[0:21:10](https://youtu.be/1Z3A6N5ck3c?t=1270) coins are landing on heads not 99.9 mm\
[0:21:13](https://youtu.be/1Z3A6N5ck3c?t=1273) 100% of the time 100% Wow\
[0:21:16](https://youtu.be/1Z3A6N5ck3c?t=1276) now what does this mean this means what\
[0:21:18](https://youtu.be/1Z3A6N5ck3c?t=1278) are the implications of this\
[0:21:20](https://youtu.be/1Z3A6N5ck3c?t=1280) implications are huge yeah the\
[0:21:23](https://youtu.be/1Z3A6N5ck3c?t=1283) implications are that randomness does\
[0:21:25](https://youtu.be/1Z3A6N5ck3c?t=1285) not exist it is a figment of your\
[0:21:27](https://youtu.be/1Z3A6N5ck3c?t=1287) imagination so what instead exists well\
[0:21:30](https://youtu.be/1Z3A6N5ck3c?t=1290) order what is the opposite of randomness\
[0:21:32](https://youtu.be/1Z3A6N5ck3c?t=1292) order you Tom Porter okay\
[0:21:34](https://youtu.be/1Z3A6N5ck3c?t=1294) there's nothing but order so you're\
[0:21:36](https://youtu.be/1Z3A6N5ck3c?t=1296) saying that there are laws that are\
[0:21:38](https://youtu.be/1Z3A6N5ck3c?t=1298) ordered and predetermined look as stated\
[0:21:41](https://youtu.be/1Z3A6N5ck3c?t=1301) in the universe look every pattern in\
[0:21:45](https://youtu.be/1Z3A6N5ck3c?t=1305) the world every scientific law I'm\
[0:21:52](https://youtu.be/1Z3A6N5ck3c?t=1312) asking this question can you put science\
[0:21:53](https://youtu.be/1Z3A6N5ck3c?t=1313) in a test-tube\
[0:21:54](https://youtu.be/1Z3A6N5ck3c?t=1314) no you cannot put science in a test-tube\
[0:21:56](https://youtu.be/1Z3A6N5ck3c?t=1316) science is not a thing a material thing\
[0:21:59](https://youtu.be/1Z3A6N5ck3c?t=1319) right it's something a construct of the\
[0:22:01](https://youtu.be/1Z3A6N5ck3c?t=1321) mind when you look at the universe and\
[0:22:03](https://youtu.be/1Z3A6N5ck3c?t=1323) you talk about science you're talking\
[0:22:05](https://youtu.be/1Z3A6N5ck3c?t=1325) about an activity inside your mind yeah\
[0:22:07](https://youtu.be/1Z3A6N5ck3c?t=1327) you were talking about because you\
[0:22:08](https://youtu.be/1Z3A6N5ck3c?t=1328) cannot weigh science you cannot hold\
[0:22:10](https://youtu.be/1Z3A6N5ck3c?t=1330) science you cannot scientifically test\
[0:22:13](https://youtu.be/1Z3A6N5ck3c?t=1333) science the the the the meta scientific\
[0:22:15](https://youtu.be/1Z3A6N5ck3c?t=1335) method we cannot scientifically test it\
[0:22:17](https://youtu.be/1Z3A6N5ck3c?t=1337) it is a mental construct it's a type of\
[0:22:19](https://youtu.be/1Z3A6N5ck3c?t=1339) thinking hmm when you say science you\
[0:22:22](https://youtu.be/1Z3A6N5ck3c?t=1342) are admitting to order you're saying\
[0:22:25](https://youtu.be/1Z3A6N5ck3c?t=1345) look I see an order if you said I don't\
[0:22:28](https://youtu.be/1Z3A6N5ck3c?t=1348) believe in science you would be saying I\
[0:22:29](https://youtu.be/1Z3A6N5ck3c?t=1349) don't see an order I see no patterns and\
[0:22:32](https://youtu.be/1Z3A6N5ck3c?t=1352) I see no regularities in nature\
[0:22:34](https://youtu.be/1Z3A6N5ck3c?t=1354) I see pure randomness now if me and you\
[0:22:36](https://youtu.be/1Z3A6N5ck3c?t=1356) lived in a universe that every time you\
[0:22:39](https://youtu.be/1Z3A6N5ck3c?t=1359) push the brake in your car the car will\
[0:22:42](https://youtu.be/1Z3A6N5ck3c?t=1362) do anything but brake will do a random\
[0:22:44](https://youtu.be/1Z3A6N5ck3c?t=1364) activity and every time you say a word\
[0:22:46](https://youtu.be/1Z3A6N5ck3c?t=1366) that word would come out completely\
[0:22:47](https://youtu.be/1Z3A6N5ck3c?t=1367) different than the time before and\
[0:22:48](https://youtu.be/1Z3A6N5ck3c?t=1368) everything was random you would say look\
[0:22:50](https://youtu.be/1Z3A6N5ck3c?t=1370) I see no sign you wouldn't know nothing\
[0:22:52](https://youtu.be/1Z3A6N5ck3c?t=1372) about science yeah that would be a truly\
[0:22:54](https://youtu.be/1Z3A6N5ck3c?t=1374) unscientific world you have a concept of\
[0:22:57](https://youtu.be/1Z3A6N5ck3c?t=1377) science\
[0:22:58](https://youtu.be/1Z3A6N5ck3c?t=1378) could you imagine a world like this no\
[0:23:00](https://youtu.be/1Z3A6N5ck3c?t=1380) it's a little bit of the Alice in\
[0:23:02](https://youtu.be/1Z3A6N5ck3c?t=1382) Wonderland\
[0:23:02](https://youtu.be/1Z3A6N5ck3c?t=1382) okay no yeah things are popping in and\
[0:23:05](https://youtu.be/1Z3A6N5ck3c?t=1385) out of existence and said they're trying\
[0:23:07](https://youtu.be/1Z3A6N5ck3c?t=1387) to create some type of random this true\
[0:23:09](https://youtu.be/1Z3A6N5ck3c?t=1389) randomness in that story it's a bit of a\
[0:23:11](https://youtu.be/1Z3A6N5ck3c?t=1391) little bit of random there is some there\
[0:23:16](https://youtu.be/1Z3A6N5ck3c?t=1396) is something special to Alice in\
[0:23:18](https://youtu.be/1Z3A6N5ck3c?t=1398) Wonderland a story for another day\
[0:23:19](https://youtu.be/1Z3A6N5ck3c?t=1399) yeah could you picture a truly random\
[0:23:22](https://youtu.be/1Z3A6N5ck3c?t=1402) world where things pop in and out of\
[0:23:24](https://youtu.be/1Z3A6N5ck3c?t=1404) existence\
[0:23:25](https://youtu.be/1Z3A6N5ck3c?t=1405) like for instance when they discovered\
[0:23:26](https://youtu.be/1Z3A6N5ck3c?t=1406) the quantum world and they reported it\
[0:23:28](https://youtu.be/1Z3A6N5ck3c?t=1408) to Einstein he famously said telling\
[0:23:35](https://youtu.be/1Z3A6N5ck3c?t=1415) them look it seems random but it is not\
[0:23:38](https://youtu.be/1Z3A6N5ck3c?t=1418) once we learn more about quantum physics\
[0:23:40](https://youtu.be/1Z3A6N5ck3c?t=1420) it won't you're seeing something so\
[0:23:42](https://youtu.be/1Z3A6N5ck3c?t=1422) preposterous God doesn't play dice with\
[0:23:45](https://youtu.be/1Z3A6N5ck3c?t=1425) the universe there is no dice in the\
[0:23:47](https://youtu.be/1Z3A6N5ck3c?t=1427) universe the dice is just a reflection\
[0:23:50](https://youtu.be/1Z3A6N5ck3c?t=1430) of your ignorance now if I roll a dice\
[0:23:52](https://youtu.be/1Z3A6N5ck3c?t=1432) that's a great example if you told me\
[0:23:56](https://youtu.be/1Z3A6N5ck3c?t=1436) exactly at what force and how you\
[0:23:59](https://youtu.be/1Z3A6N5ck3c?t=1439) started with it if I had all the\
[0:24:00](https://youtu.be/1Z3A6N5ck3c?t=1440) information I turned it to math I could\
[0:24:02](https://youtu.be/1Z3A6N5ck3c?t=1442) tell you exactly how the dice mmm is\
[0:24:04](https://youtu.be/1Z3A6N5ck3c?t=1444) going to land there is no randomness so\
[0:24:07](https://youtu.be/1Z3A6N5ck3c?t=1447) how does this link to the whole fee ism\
[0:24:09](https://youtu.be/1Z3A6N5ck3c?t=1449) atheism theism debate well this is this\
[0:24:12](https://youtu.be/1Z3A6N5ck3c?t=1452) is the nucleus of the matter right\
[0:24:16](https://youtu.be/1Z3A6N5ck3c?t=1456) picture me a random world before we\
[0:24:20](https://youtu.be/1Z3A6N5ck3c?t=1460) answer that question picture me around\
[0:24:21](https://youtu.be/1Z3A6N5ck3c?t=1461) so it would be one that you describe one\
[0:24:23](https://youtu.be/1Z3A6N5ck3c?t=1463) so one maybe well that doesn't even\
[0:24:25](https://youtu.be/1Z3A6N5ck3c?t=1465) exist a one does it doesn't exist yeah\
[0:24:26](https://youtu.be/1Z3A6N5ck3c?t=1466) picture one try so maybe things are just\
[0:24:28](https://youtu.be/1Z3A6N5ck3c?t=1468) popping in and out of existence\
[0:24:30](https://youtu.be/1Z3A6N5ck3c?t=1470) okay give me an example like you say so\
[0:24:33](https://youtu.be/1Z3A6N5ck3c?t=1473) if for example it's hard to envision\
[0:24:35](https://youtu.be/1Z3A6N5ck3c?t=1475) yeah it's just something which things\
[0:24:38](https://youtu.be/1Z3A6N5ck3c?t=1478) are moving all the time just it's very\
[0:24:40](https://youtu.be/1Z3A6N5ck3c?t=1480) here there will be no like even be able\
[0:24:43](https://youtu.be/1Z3A6N5ck3c?t=1483) to talk in a truly weird there would be\
[0:24:45](https://youtu.be/1Z3A6N5ck3c?t=1485) no conversation because patterns and\
[0:24:48](https://youtu.be/1Z3A6N5ck3c?t=1488) regularities languages patterns and\
[0:24:50](https://youtu.be/1Z3A6N5ck3c?t=1490) regularities everything is patterns and\
[0:24:52](https://youtu.be/1Z3A6N5ck3c?t=1492) regularities your whole existence you\
[0:24:55](https://youtu.be/1Z3A6N5ck3c?t=1495) would go mad if you didn't have patterns\
[0:24:56](https://youtu.be/1Z3A6N5ck3c?t=1496) and regularities these patterns and\
[0:24:59](https://youtu.be/1Z3A6N5ck3c?t=1499) regularities are the opposite of\
[0:25:00](https://youtu.be/1Z3A6N5ck3c?t=1500) randomness when they say the world came\
[0:25:03](https://youtu.be/1Z3A6N5ck3c?t=1503) to be that becomes the now we're\
[0:25:08](https://youtu.be/1Z3A6N5ck3c?t=1508) starting to deduce now a creative\
[0:25:09](https://youtu.be/1Z3A6N5ck3c?t=1509) deduction when the world became to be\
[0:25:11](https://youtu.be/1Z3A6N5ck3c?t=1511) they say look there are so many\
[0:25:12](https://youtu.be/1Z3A6N5ck3c?t=1512) universes that this one landed the way\
[0:25:14](https://youtu.be/1Z3A6N5ck3c?t=1514) it is yeah at random they say this\
[0:25:20](https://youtu.be/1Z3A6N5ck3c?t=1520) universe didn't land that random it\
[0:25:23](https://youtu.be/1Z3A6N5ck3c?t=1523) landed exactly precisely because of\
[0:25:27](https://youtu.be/1Z3A6N5ck3c?t=1527) patterns and regularities\
[0:25:30](https://youtu.be/1Z3A6N5ck3c?t=1530) this entails heavily god it doesn't tell\
[0:25:34](https://youtu.be/1Z3A6N5ck3c?t=1534) god it basically says look god created\
[0:25:36](https://youtu.be/1Z3A6N5ck3c?t=1536) order in the universe this is what is\
[0:25:38](https://youtu.be/1Z3A6N5ck3c?t=1538) known as top down not bottom up bottom\
[0:25:40](https://youtu.be/1Z3A6N5ck3c?t=1540) up is by trial and error top down is by\
[0:25:43](https://youtu.be/1Z3A6N5ck3c?t=1543) design\
[0:25:43](https://youtu.be/1Z3A6N5ck3c?t=1543) now I don't hold the same views as the\
[0:25:46](https://youtu.be/1Z3A6N5ck3c?t=1546) mainstream design believers okay maybe\
[0:25:50](https://youtu.be/1Z3A6N5ck3c?t=1550) should not have used that word because\
[0:25:52](https://youtu.be/1Z3A6N5ck3c?t=1552) people don't associate me with the\
[0:25:54](https://youtu.be/1Z3A6N5ck3c?t=1554) people who the way I see if you look at\
[0:25:59](https://youtu.be/1Z3A6N5ck3c?t=1559) the Quran Francis is some beautiful\
[0:26:01](https://youtu.be/1Z3A6N5ck3c?t=1561) verses it's a beautiful beautiful verses\
[0:26:03](https://youtu.be/1Z3A6N5ck3c?t=1563) that I don't know an Arabic and I wish I\
[0:26:04](https://youtu.be/1Z3A6N5ck3c?t=1564) could do them justice and tell you them\
[0:26:06](https://youtu.be/1Z3A6N5ck3c?t=1566) properly but God says the night and the\
[0:26:08](https://youtu.be/1Z3A6N5ck3c?t=1568) day the pattern of night and day that's\
[0:26:11](https://youtu.be/1Z3A6N5ck3c?t=1571) a sign for those who think that pattern\
[0:26:14](https://youtu.be/1Z3A6N5ck3c?t=1574) the Sun if it was random\
[0:26:16](https://youtu.be/1Z3A6N5ck3c?t=1576) it would blink in and out of existence\
[0:26:17](https://youtu.be/1Z3A6N5ck3c?t=1577) of a change change temperature it would\
[0:26:19](https://youtu.be/1Z3A6N5ck3c?t=1579) change color it would do all sorts of\
[0:26:21](https://youtu.be/1Z3A6N5ck3c?t=1581) great things it's not it follows an\
[0:26:23](https://youtu.be/1Z3A6N5ck3c?t=1583) exact measurement francis exactly the\
[0:26:26](https://youtu.be/1Z3A6N5ck3c?t=1586) quran says this measurement shows will\
[0:26:28](https://youtu.be/1Z3A6N5ck3c?t=1588) cover we husband that the Sun and the\
[0:26:30](https://youtu.be/1Z3A6N5ck3c?t=1590) moon for an exact measure measure really\
[0:26:33](https://youtu.be/1Z3A6N5ck3c?t=1593) yeah to say it's to say it's random is\
[0:26:38](https://youtu.be/1Z3A6N5ck3c?t=1598) to make yourself the center of the\
[0:26:39](https://youtu.be/1Z3A6N5ck3c?t=1599) universe Wow yeah because you're seeing\
[0:26:43](https://youtu.be/1Z3A6N5ck3c?t=1603) the world through your own eyes and\
[0:26:46](https://youtu.be/1Z3A6N5ck3c?t=1606) you're being soft centered you're making\
[0:26:49](https://youtu.be/1Z3A6N5ck3c?t=1609) the world all about me I'm the center of\
[0:26:51](https://youtu.be/1Z3A6N5ck3c?t=1611) my universe it's a type of egoism the\
[0:26:56](https://youtu.be/1Z3A6N5ck3c?t=1616) world\
[0:26:56](https://youtu.be/1Z3A6N5ck3c?t=1616) I'm the measure of all things like they\
[0:26:58](https://youtu.be/1Z3A6N5ck3c?t=1618) were there was the the surface they say\
[0:27:00](https://youtu.be/1Z3A6N5ck3c?t=1620) manage the measure of all things mmm\
[0:27:02](https://youtu.be/1Z3A6N5ck3c?t=1622) this in Islam is the polar opposite of\
[0:27:04](https://youtu.be/1Z3A6N5ck3c?t=1624) his love hmm\
[0:27:05](https://youtu.be/1Z3A6N5ck3c?t=1625) I would tell you man is not a measure of\
[0:27:07](https://youtu.be/1Z3A6N5ck3c?t=1627) all things the truth is above man\
[0:27:10](https://youtu.be/1Z3A6N5ck3c?t=1630) so I mean Socrates had a great dialogue\
[0:27:13](https://youtu.be/1Z3A6N5ck3c?t=1633) in the book of Gorgas with the Sophos\
[0:27:15](https://youtu.be/1Z3A6N5ck3c?t=1635) and he kind of shut them down you kind\
[0:27:16](https://youtu.be/1Z3A6N5ck3c?t=1636) of give them in my opinion the deathblow\
[0:27:18](https://youtu.be/1Z3A6N5ck3c?t=1638) man is not to measure all things there\
[0:27:20](https://youtu.be/1Z3A6N5ck3c?t=1640) is an independent truth outside of man\
[0:27:22](https://youtu.be/1Z3A6N5ck3c?t=1642) agree to it or not as yeah so Socrates\
[0:27:26](https://youtu.be/1Z3A6N5ck3c?t=1646) does it beautifully in the book of\
[0:27:27](https://youtu.be/1Z3A6N5ck3c?t=1647) Gorgas I won't go to it maybe later if\
[0:27:29](https://youtu.be/1Z3A6N5ck3c?t=1649) we have times and this would be a\
[0:27:31](https://youtu.be/1Z3A6N5ck3c?t=1651) tangent okay\
[0:27:32](https://youtu.be/1Z3A6N5ck3c?t=1652) but mm-hmm there is no randomness there\
[0:27:36](https://youtu.be/1Z3A6N5ck3c?t=1656) are only patterns and regularities these\
[0:27:38](https://youtu.be/1Z3A6N5ck3c?t=1658) patterns and regularities are not\
[0:27:41](https://youtu.be/1Z3A6N5ck3c?t=1661) are not logical in any way hmm they're\
[0:27:49](https://youtu.be/1Z3A6N5ck3c?t=1669) not necessary in any way they're not\
[0:27:51](https://youtu.be/1Z3A6N5ck3c?t=1671) necessary in any way there's no logical\
[0:27:53](https://youtu.be/1Z3A6N5ck3c?t=1673) reason for them to exist in the way they\
[0:27:55](https://youtu.be/1Z3A6N5ck3c?t=1675) do there is no logical reason for them\
[0:27:57](https://youtu.be/1Z3A6N5ck3c?t=1677) to exist whatsoever logical reason yeah\
[0:28:00](https://youtu.be/1Z3A6N5ck3c?t=1680) when I flip the coin in front of your\
[0:28:01](https://youtu.be/1Z3A6N5ck3c?t=1681) eyes you would know before you've ever\
[0:28:03](https://youtu.be/1Z3A6N5ck3c?t=1683) experienced one you wouldn't know you\
[0:28:04](https://youtu.be/1Z3A6N5ck3c?t=1684) said I realized yeah I've deduced we\
[0:28:07](https://youtu.be/1Z3A6N5ck3c?t=1687) don't reduce the our experiences we\
[0:28:10](https://youtu.be/1Z3A6N5ck3c?t=1690) discover our experiences mm-hmm it's a\
[0:28:14](https://youtu.be/1Z3A6N5ck3c?t=1694) bit complicated it's a bit sticky but if\
[0:28:16](https://youtu.be/1Z3A6N5ck3c?t=1696) you meditate on you think about it\
[0:28:18](https://youtu.be/1Z3A6N5ck3c?t=1698) you'll realize there's no such thing as\
[0:28:19](https://youtu.be/1Z3A6N5ck3c?t=1699) randomness and the only thing left is\
[0:28:21](https://youtu.be/1Z3A6N5ck3c?t=1701) order yeah when you look at science\
[0:28:24](https://youtu.be/1Z3A6N5ck3c?t=1704) science is not out there\
[0:28:26](https://youtu.be/1Z3A6N5ck3c?t=1706) science is an internal experience you\
[0:28:29](https://youtu.be/1Z3A6N5ck3c?t=1709) are noticing these patterns and\
[0:28:30](https://youtu.be/1Z3A6N5ck3c?t=1710) regularities now a scientists will say\
[0:28:32](https://youtu.be/1Z3A6N5ck3c?t=1712) no no look there were so many earths out\
[0:28:34](https://youtu.be/1Z3A6N5ck3c?t=1714) there at random he'll throw that word in\
[0:28:38](https://youtu.be/1Z3A6N5ck3c?t=1718) and one of them so happened to be close\
[0:28:40](https://youtu.be/1Z3A6N5ck3c?t=1720) enough to the Sun it didn't burn but\
[0:28:42](https://youtu.be/1Z3A6N5ck3c?t=1722) close enough that it didn't freeze far\
[0:28:44](https://youtu.be/1Z3A6N5ck3c?t=1724) enough away that had been in vertical\
[0:28:45](https://youtu.be/1Z3A6N5ck3c?t=1725) something and freeze I will agree that\
[0:28:48](https://youtu.be/1Z3A6N5ck3c?t=1728) there are maybe many earths mmm\
[0:28:50](https://youtu.be/1Z3A6N5ck3c?t=1730) somewhere too close somewhere too far\
[0:28:52](https://youtu.be/1Z3A6N5ck3c?t=1732) and one of them was the Goldilocks right\
[0:28:54](https://youtu.be/1Z3A6N5ck3c?t=1734) the right amount but I won't agree that\
[0:28:57](https://youtu.be/1Z3A6N5ck3c?t=1737) it was random I will agree like Leibniz\
[0:29:00](https://youtu.be/1Z3A6N5ck3c?t=1740) would say again none of these ideas are\
[0:29:02](https://youtu.be/1Z3A6N5ck3c?t=1742) mine okay I don't want to think any\
[0:29:02](https://youtu.be/1Z3A6N5ck3c?t=1742) please don't don't if you're agree with\
[0:29:04](https://youtu.be/1Z3A6N5ck3c?t=1744) me don't give me any credit and you\
[0:29:05](https://youtu.be/1Z3A6N5ck3c?t=1745) disagree with me please no you're\
[0:29:07](https://youtu.be/1Z3A6N5ck3c?t=1747) disagreeing with the Giants of\
[0:29:08](https://youtu.be/1Z3A6N5ck3c?t=1748) philosophy and science liveness will\
[0:29:11](https://youtu.be/1Z3A6N5ck3c?t=1751) tell you this is Leibniz was is often in\
[0:29:13](https://youtu.be/1Z3A6N5ck3c?t=1753) the top five of the greatest IQs of all\
[0:29:16](https://youtu.be/1Z3A6N5ck3c?t=1756) time and all the lists are the consensus\
[0:29:17](https://youtu.be/1Z3A6N5ck3c?t=1757) he's the man who invented who discovered\
[0:29:21](https://youtu.be/1Z3A6N5ck3c?t=1761) excuse me a calculus and the binary code\
[0:29:25](https://youtu.be/1Z3A6N5ck3c?t=1765) your computer this phone it's all\
[0:29:26](https://youtu.be/1Z3A6N5ck3c?t=1766) working because of lightness okay and\
[0:29:28](https://youtu.be/1Z3A6N5ck3c?t=1768) he's a brilliant really human being\
[0:29:29](https://youtu.be/1Z3A6N5ck3c?t=1769) brilliant philosopher we'll talk about\
[0:29:31](https://youtu.be/1Z3A6N5ck3c?t=1771) him many times in their discussions he\
[0:29:34](https://youtu.be/1Z3A6N5ck3c?t=1774) said look this world is the perfect\
[0:29:36](https://youtu.be/1Z3A6N5ck3c?t=1776) world why I won't get into it completely\
[0:29:39](https://youtu.be/1Z3A6N5ck3c?t=1779) but he's saying look there could not\
[0:29:41](https://youtu.be/1Z3A6N5ck3c?t=1781) have been that this world was made this\
[0:29:43](https://youtu.be/1Z3A6N5ck3c?t=1783) way it was contingent and he was a\
[0:29:46](https://youtu.be/1Z3A6N5ck3c?t=1786) theist he had a great argument for the\
[0:29:49](https://youtu.be/1Z3A6N5ck3c?t=1789) khadija yes its contingent but because\
[0:29:52](https://youtu.be/1Z3A6N5ck3c?t=1792) God made it this way it's the purpose\
[0:29:54](https://youtu.be/1Z3A6N5ck3c?t=1794) there wasn't a rat not a random effect\
[0:29:56](https://youtu.be/1Z3A6N5ck3c?t=1796) hmm these patterns and regularities are\
[0:29:59](https://youtu.be/1Z3A6N5ck3c?t=1799) not random they're illogical hmm they're\
[0:30:04](https://youtu.be/1Z3A6N5ck3c?t=1804) completely illogical hmm there is no\
[0:30:06](https://youtu.be/1Z3A6N5ck3c?t=1806) logic to them there's no logical way of\
[0:30:08](https://youtu.be/1Z3A6N5ck3c?t=1808) explaining why they exist even there is\
[0:30:11](https://youtu.be/1Z3A6N5ck3c?t=1811) no that's a better way to say it\
[0:30:12](https://youtu.be/1Z3A6N5ck3c?t=1812) maybe Allah his own logic for how it\
[0:30:14](https://youtu.be/1Z3A6N5ck3c?t=1814) created the world but there is no way of\
[0:30:18](https://youtu.be/1Z3A6N5ck3c?t=1818) deducing them logically it's impossible\
[0:30:20](https://youtu.be/1Z3A6N5ck3c?t=1820) hmm randomness is a figment of your\
[0:30:23](https://youtu.be/1Z3A6N5ck3c?t=1823) imagination because if I increase your\
[0:30:24](https://youtu.be/1Z3A6N5ck3c?t=1824) knowledge randomness will disappear so\
[0:30:26](https://youtu.be/1Z3A6N5ck3c?t=1826) the most worthwhile explanation is to\
[0:30:29](https://youtu.be/1Z3A6N5ck3c?t=1829) say that this universe had these laws\
[0:30:34](https://youtu.be/1Z3A6N5ck3c?t=1834) placed within them by a higher\
[0:30:37](https://youtu.be/1Z3A6N5ck3c?t=1837) metaphysical agency these laws don't\
[0:30:39](https://youtu.be/1Z3A6N5ck3c?t=1839) exist their patterns and regularities\
[0:30:40](https://youtu.be/1Z3A6N5ck3c?t=1840) and we project laws these laws are just\
[0:30:45](https://youtu.be/1Z3A6N5ck3c?t=1845) our way of talking about our just our\
[0:30:47](https://youtu.be/1Z3A6N5ck3c?t=1847) way of bookmarking the patterns all\
[0:30:49](https://youtu.be/1Z3A6N5ck3c?t=1849) right all right yeah but the pansy I'll\
[0:30:52](https://youtu.be/1Z3A6N5ck3c?t=1852) give you for instance\
[0:30:53](https://youtu.be/1Z3A6N5ck3c?t=1853) Isaac Newton one of the brilliant most\
[0:30:55](https://youtu.be/1Z3A6N5ck3c?t=1855) brilliant man in history he said look\
[0:30:56](https://youtu.be/1Z3A6N5ck3c?t=1856) here the three laws of motions hmm I've\
[0:30:58](https://youtu.be/1Z3A6N5ck3c?t=1858) discovered them hmm turns out they're\
[0:31:01](https://youtu.be/1Z3A6N5ck3c?t=1861) wrong did you guys know that well yeah\
[0:31:03](https://youtu.be/1Z3A6N5ck3c?t=1863) his theories on gravity were wrong he\
[0:31:05](https://youtu.be/1Z3A6N5ck3c?t=1865) thought gravity was a pulling force yeah\
[0:31:07](https://youtu.be/1Z3A6N5ck3c?t=1867) gravity is a pushing force Einstein and\
[0:31:09](https://youtu.be/1Z3A6N5ck3c?t=1869) one day we'll discuss how Einstein\
[0:31:11](https://youtu.be/1Z3A6N5ck3c?t=1871) figured that out with a thought\
[0:31:12](https://youtu.be/1Z3A6N5ck3c?t=1872) experiment we're doing a thought\
[0:31:14](https://youtu.be/1Z3A6N5ck3c?t=1874) experiment\
[0:31:15](https://youtu.be/1Z3A6N5ck3c?t=1875) Einstein one of the great kings of\
[0:31:16](https://youtu.be/1Z3A6N5ck3c?t=1876) thought experiments how he figured out\
[0:31:19](https://youtu.be/1Z3A6N5ck3c?t=1879) is a beautiful story how he figured out\
[0:31:20](https://youtu.be/1Z3A6N5ck3c?t=1880) that gravity is a pushing force not a\
[0:31:22](https://youtu.be/1Z3A6N5ck3c?t=1882) pulling force he outdid Isaac Newton hmm\
[0:31:26](https://youtu.be/1Z3A6N5ck3c?t=1886) when they asked him how do you feel to\
[0:31:28](https://youtu.be/1Z3A6N5ck3c?t=1888) have done Isaac Newton you know he's he\
[0:31:30](https://youtu.be/1Z3A6N5ck3c?t=1890) giving beautiful answer he said if I see\
[0:31:32](https://youtu.be/1Z3A6N5ck3c?t=1892) farce because I stand on the shoulders\
[0:31:33](https://youtu.be/1Z3A6N5ck3c?t=1893) of giants meaning Sir Isaac Newton's\
[0:31:36](https://youtu.be/1Z3A6N5ck3c?t=1896) work made pave the way for my work\
[0:31:38](https://youtu.be/1Z3A6N5ck3c?t=1898) because Isaac Newton was wrong about\
[0:31:41](https://youtu.be/1Z3A6N5ck3c?t=1901) gravity we still used as physicists\
[0:31:44](https://youtu.be/1Z3A6N5ck3c?t=1904) still use the three laws of motion\
[0:31:46](https://youtu.be/1Z3A6N5ck3c?t=1906) because they're so useful however\
[0:31:47](https://youtu.be/1Z3A6N5ck3c?t=1907) they're not fundamentally true another\
[0:31:49](https://youtu.be/1Z3A6N5ck3c?t=1909) scientific fact that we had to revisit\
[0:31:51](https://youtu.be/1Z3A6N5ck3c?t=1911) nothing wrong with it I praise the man\
[0:31:53](https://youtu.be/1Z3A6N5ck3c?t=1913) he was a brilliant man\
[0:31:54](https://youtu.be/1Z3A6N5ck3c?t=1914) hmm however these laws of physics were\
[0:31:57](https://youtu.be/1Z3A6N5ck3c?t=1917) just bookmarks yeah for patterns\
[0:31:59](https://youtu.be/1Z3A6N5ck3c?t=1919) irregularities however is explanations\
[0:32:02](https://youtu.be/1Z3A6N5ck3c?t=1922) for pattern irregularity\
[0:32:02](https://youtu.be/1Z3A6N5ck3c?t=1922) were wrong they were they were\
[0:32:04](https://youtu.be/1Z3A6N5ck3c?t=1924) illusionary Einstein figured out the\
[0:32:06](https://youtu.be/1Z3A6N5ck3c?t=1926) true cause the the seemingly truth it's\
[0:32:12](https://youtu.be/1Z3A6N5ck3c?t=1932) kind of like the the Sun going around\
[0:32:14](https://youtu.be/1Z3A6N5ck3c?t=1934) the earth hmm there wasn't there was an\
[0:32:16](https://youtu.be/1Z3A6N5ck3c?t=1936) illusion there and then Einstein proved\
[0:32:18](https://youtu.be/1Z3A6N5ck3c?t=1938) it okay he proved it with a thought\
[0:32:19](https://youtu.be/1Z3A6N5ck3c?t=1939) experiment he said what of the Sun\
[0:32:20](https://youtu.be/1Z3A6N5ck3c?t=1940) disappears science try and prove\
[0:32:23](https://youtu.be/1Z3A6N5ck3c?t=1943) something exactly exactly so these are\
[0:32:25](https://youtu.be/1Z3A6N5ck3c?t=1945) the laws of physics are just bookmarks\
[0:32:27](https://youtu.be/1Z3A6N5ck3c?t=1947) they're just our way of saying look here\
[0:32:30](https://youtu.be/1Z3A6N5ck3c?t=1950) these patterns let's give it a name\
[0:32:32](https://youtu.be/1Z3A6N5ck3c?t=1952) let's give it a label they also they\
[0:32:35](https://youtu.be/1Z3A6N5ck3c?t=1955) indicate the existence of a higher\
[0:32:37](https://youtu.be/1Z3A6N5ck3c?t=1957) metaphysical being absolutely it's the\
[0:32:39](https://youtu.be/1Z3A6N5ck3c?t=1959) greatest egocentric it's the greatest\
[0:32:42](https://youtu.be/1Z3A6N5ck3c?t=1962) egotistical statement to say something\
[0:32:45](https://youtu.be/1Z3A6N5ck3c?t=1965) as random well why because you're saying\
[0:32:48](https://youtu.be/1Z3A6N5ck3c?t=1968) that the world is us how I see it and\
[0:32:51](https://youtu.be/1Z3A6N5ck3c?t=1971) because my ignorance is here the world's\
[0:32:54](https://youtu.be/1Z3A6N5ck3c?t=1974) here that cannot see any further a great\
[0:32:56](https://youtu.be/1Z3A6N5ck3c?t=1976) question I want to ask you is the\
[0:32:58](https://youtu.be/1Z3A6N5ck3c?t=1978) highest mountain you've ever seen this\
[0:33:00](https://youtu.be/1Z3A6N5ck3c?t=1980) is a great question I'm forgetting about\
[0:33:02](https://youtu.be/1Z3A6N5ck3c?t=1982) who said it's such a beautiful question\
[0:33:03](https://youtu.be/1Z3A6N5ck3c?t=1983) is the highest mountain you've ever seen\
[0:33:05](https://youtu.be/1Z3A6N5ck3c?t=1985) comedy job the highest mountain that\
[0:33:08](https://youtu.be/1Z3A6N5ck3c?t=1988) exists no how do you feel that you can\
[0:33:13](https://youtu.be/1Z3A6N5ck3c?t=1993) imagine possibly you know that your\
[0:33:14](https://youtu.be/1Z3A6N5ck3c?t=1994) experiences are not the end-all be-all\
[0:33:16](https://youtu.be/1Z3A6N5ck3c?t=1996) it's a very humble answer yeah to say\
[0:33:18](https://youtu.be/1Z3A6N5ck3c?t=1998) you know what maybe not but the man who\
[0:33:20](https://youtu.be/1Z3A6N5ck3c?t=2000) says the highest mountain I've seen is\
[0:33:22](https://youtu.be/1Z3A6N5ck3c?t=2002) the highest mountain there is mm-hmm\
[0:33:24](https://youtu.be/1Z3A6N5ck3c?t=2004) he's taking an egocentric position he's\
[0:33:26](https://youtu.be/1Z3A6N5ck3c?t=2006) saying I'm the measure of truth that's a\
[0:33:29](https://youtu.be/1Z3A6N5ck3c?t=2009) really it is it is a beautiful way when\
[0:33:32](https://youtu.be/1Z3A6N5ck3c?t=2012) somebody tells you something is random\
[0:33:33](https://youtu.be/1Z3A6N5ck3c?t=2013) and they refuse to let go of randomness\
[0:33:35](https://youtu.be/1Z3A6N5ck3c?t=2015) they're telling you look don't tell me\
[0:33:36](https://youtu.be/1Z3A6N5ck3c?t=2016) I'm ignorant it's a personal issue and\
[0:33:39](https://youtu.be/1Z3A6N5ck3c?t=2019) philosophy why people don't like\
[0:33:40](https://youtu.be/1Z3A6N5ck3c?t=2020) philosophy and I remember reading one of\
[0:33:42](https://youtu.be/1Z3A6N5ck3c?t=2022) my textbooks he was saying look\
[0:33:43](https://youtu.be/1Z3A6N5ck3c?t=2023) philosophy is you looking in the mirror\
[0:33:45](https://youtu.be/1Z3A6N5ck3c?t=2025) and he was saying if you don't want to\
[0:33:48](https://youtu.be/1Z3A6N5ck3c?t=2028) know that you're ugly\
[0:33:49](https://youtu.be/1Z3A6N5ck3c?t=2029) don't go look in the river don't go look\
[0:33:52](https://youtu.be/1Z3A6N5ck3c?t=2032) in the river that's how people used to\
[0:33:53](https://youtu.be/1Z3A6N5ck3c?t=2033) see the reflections if you want to\
[0:33:56](https://youtu.be/1Z3A6N5ck3c?t=2036) believe you're beautiful don't look in\
[0:33:57](https://youtu.be/1Z3A6N5ck3c?t=2037) the river because when you look in the\
[0:33:58](https://youtu.be/1Z3A6N5ck3c?t=2038) river you can see your reflection in\
[0:33:59](https://youtu.be/1Z3A6N5ck3c?t=2039) philosophy when you study philosophy you\
[0:34:02](https://youtu.be/1Z3A6N5ck3c?t=2042) realize how little you know no I start\
[0:34:04](https://youtu.be/1Z3A6N5ck3c?t=2044) as sorry Socrates said it so well\
[0:34:06](https://youtu.be/1Z3A6N5ck3c?t=2046) knowledge is to know the extent of your\
[0:34:07](https://youtu.be/1Z3A6N5ck3c?t=2047) own ignorance\
[0:34:08](https://youtu.be/1Z3A6N5ck3c?t=2048) randomness is a reflection of my\
[0:34:10](https://youtu.be/1Z3A6N5ck3c?t=2050) ignorance I know that randomness when I\
[0:34:12](https://youtu.be/1Z3A6N5ck3c?t=2052) see something around this I know it's\
[0:34:13](https://youtu.be/1Z3A6N5ck3c?t=2053) not the truth capital T\
[0:34:15](https://youtu.be/1Z3A6N5ck3c?t=2055) it's my level the highest mountain that\
[0:34:17](https://youtu.be/1Z3A6N5ck3c?t=2057) I've seen is not necessarily the highest\
[0:34:19](https://youtu.be/1Z3A6N5ck3c?t=2059) mountain you know the highest mountain\
[0:34:20](https://youtu.be/1Z3A6N5ck3c?t=2060) we have observed as a human species on\
[0:34:22](https://youtu.be/1Z3A6N5ck3c?t=2062) Mars hmm it's bigger than the state of\
[0:34:24](https://youtu.be/1Z3A6N5ck3c?t=2064) Texas so if you stood on the highest\
[0:34:27](https://youtu.be/1Z3A6N5ck3c?t=2067) mountain earth EC proclaim this to be\
[0:34:29](https://youtu.be/1Z3A6N5ck3c?t=2069) the highest mountain you'd be wrong we\
[0:34:30](https://youtu.be/1Z3A6N5ck3c?t=2070) know of a higher much higher mountain\
[0:34:32](https://youtu.be/1Z3A6N5ck3c?t=2072) they say that mountain so high if you\
[0:34:33](https://youtu.be/1Z3A6N5ck3c?t=2073) were standing on it you wouldn't even\
[0:34:35](https://youtu.be/1Z3A6N5ck3c?t=2075) know you're on the mountain hmm so\
[0:34:38](https://youtu.be/1Z3A6N5ck3c?t=2078) randomness is it is a figment of your\
[0:34:39](https://youtu.be/1Z3A6N5ck3c?t=2079) imagination all we know is Gorder and\
[0:34:41](https://youtu.be/1Z3A6N5ck3c?t=2081) the story about the multiverse would\
[0:34:43](https://youtu.be/1Z3A6N5ck3c?t=2083) still not escape the problem you know\
[0:34:45](https://youtu.be/1Z3A6N5ck3c?t=2085) some people say oh there's a multiverse\
[0:34:47](https://youtu.be/1Z3A6N5ck3c?t=2087) hmm you should still have not understood\
[0:34:51](https://youtu.be/1Z3A6N5ck3c?t=2091) determinism determinism if there was a\
[0:34:54](https://youtu.be/1Z3A6N5ck3c?t=2094) multiverse then there is one multiverse\
[0:34:57](https://youtu.be/1Z3A6N5ck3c?t=2097) it would never change you you never\
[0:34:59](https://youtu.be/1Z3A6N5ck3c?t=2099) escape determinism we will do a video\
[0:35:01](https://youtu.be/1Z3A6N5ck3c?t=2101) I'm sure when they order determinism\
[0:35:03](https://youtu.be/1Z3A6N5ck3c?t=2103) yeah determinism in philosophy is the\
[0:35:06](https://youtu.be/1Z3A6N5ck3c?t=2106) one thing we all agree on I don't care\
[0:35:08](https://youtu.be/1Z3A6N5ck3c?t=2108) who you are\
[0:35:08](https://youtu.be/1Z3A6N5ck3c?t=2108) atheists theists a logician we all agree\
[0:35:11](https://youtu.be/1Z3A6N5ck3c?t=2111) on the term is in philosophy we say you\
[0:35:13](https://youtu.be/1Z3A6N5ck3c?t=2113) either agree with determinism or you\
[0:35:15](https://youtu.be/1Z3A6N5ck3c?t=2115) don't understand it that's the two\
[0:35:17](https://youtu.be/1Z3A6N5ck3c?t=2117) positions when I would go to school some\
[0:35:21](https://youtu.be/1Z3A6N5ck3c?t=2121) people would be upset with determinism\
[0:35:22](https://youtu.be/1Z3A6N5ck3c?t=2122) that there's no randomness except people\
[0:35:24](https://youtu.be/1Z3A6N5ck3c?t=2124) would be furious they don't understand\
[0:35:27](https://youtu.be/1Z3A6N5ck3c?t=2127) they would fail the teacher will give\
[0:35:29](https://youtu.be/1Z3A6N5ck3c?t=2129) you a zero you didn't understand hmm\
[0:35:31](https://youtu.be/1Z3A6N5ck3c?t=2131) determinism is a very important topic in\
[0:35:34](https://youtu.be/1Z3A6N5ck3c?t=2134) Islam people Muslims my knowledge we are\
[0:35:36](https://youtu.be/1Z3A6N5ck3c?t=2136) hard determinist in Islam it's hard core\
[0:35:39](https://youtu.be/1Z3A6N5ck3c?t=2139) determines we have that balance between\
[0:35:40](https://youtu.be/1Z3A6N5ck3c?t=2140) free will and determinism it\
[0:35:42](https://youtu.be/1Z3A6N5ck3c?t=2142) it's what Hegel would call an apparent\
[0:35:44](https://youtu.be/1Z3A6N5ck3c?t=2144) contradiction man you know I mean I will\
[0:35:47](https://youtu.be/1Z3A6N5ck3c?t=2147) talk about anything you want yeah listen\
[0:35:49](https://youtu.be/1Z3A6N5ck3c?t=2149) determinism even when you move your own\
[0:35:52](https://youtu.be/1Z3A6N5ck3c?t=2152) hands physics will explain how you move\
[0:35:54](https://youtu.be/1Z3A6N5ck3c?t=2154) your own hand remember we said the cause\
[0:35:56](https://youtu.be/1Z3A6N5ck3c?t=2156) of line is complete physics tells us\
[0:35:58](https://youtu.be/1Z3A6N5ck3c?t=2158) that every action in the history of the\
[0:36:00](https://youtu.be/1Z3A6N5ck3c?t=2160) world is due to two things your genetics\
[0:36:03](https://youtu.be/1Z3A6N5ck3c?t=2163) and your environment about the mind\
[0:36:06](https://youtu.be/1Z3A6N5ck3c?t=2166) we'll get to that after mmm it's a very\
[0:36:09](https://youtu.be/1Z3A6N5ck3c?t=2169) interesting question very interesting\
[0:36:10](https://youtu.be/1Z3A6N5ck3c?t=2170) but to keep things super simple\
[0:36:13](https://youtu.be/1Z3A6N5ck3c?t=2173) if I observe every behavior you've ever\
[0:36:16](https://youtu.be/1Z3A6N5ck3c?t=2176) done every action it's a result of two\
[0:36:19](https://youtu.be/1Z3A6N5ck3c?t=2179) things your genetics and your\
[0:36:22](https://youtu.be/1Z3A6N5ck3c?t=2182) environment so for instance keep it\
[0:36:24](https://youtu.be/1Z3A6N5ck3c?t=2184) really simple here as simple as possible\
[0:36:27](https://youtu.be/1Z3A6N5ck3c?t=2187) you go in a restaurant there are two\
[0:36:29](https://youtu.be/1Z3A6N5ck3c?t=2189) flavors hmm vanilla or chocolate go\
[0:36:32](https://youtu.be/1Z3A6N5ck3c?t=2192) ahead choose choose the flavor vanilla\
[0:36:44](https://youtu.be/1Z3A6N5ck3c?t=2204) or chocolate right I've been vanilla\
[0:36:47](https://youtu.be/1Z3A6N5ck3c?t=2207) okay why did you choose vanilla two\
[0:36:51](https://youtu.be/1Z3A6N5ck3c?t=2211) choices and I chose one okay you just\
[0:36:54](https://youtu.be/1Z3A6N5ck3c?t=2214) tell you there's an explanation\
[0:36:56](https://youtu.be/1Z3A6N5ck3c?t=2216) you chose vanilla because your taste\
[0:36:58](https://youtu.be/1Z3A6N5ck3c?t=2218) buds hmm\
[0:36:59](https://youtu.be/1Z3A6N5ck3c?t=2219) they have a chemical reaction that's\
[0:37:02](https://youtu.be/1Z3A6N5ck3c?t=2222) more pleasurable then when your taste\
[0:37:06](https://youtu.be/1Z3A6N5ck3c?t=2226) buds touch chocolate yeah and they're\
[0:37:08](https://youtu.be/1Z3A6N5ck3c?t=2228) this way because of your genetics and\
[0:37:09](https://youtu.be/1Z3A6N5ck3c?t=2229) your genetics you didn't choose them mmm\
[0:37:11](https://youtu.be/1Z3A6N5ck3c?t=2231) hence you didn't choose vanilla your\
[0:37:14](https://youtu.be/1Z3A6N5ck3c?t=2234) genetics chose for you because you\
[0:37:15](https://youtu.be/1Z3A6N5ck3c?t=2235) always follow your greatest desire and\
[0:37:17](https://youtu.be/1Z3A6N5ck3c?t=2237) you have no choice in the matter every\
[0:37:19](https://youtu.be/1Z3A6N5ck3c?t=2239) human being always follows their\
[0:37:20](https://youtu.be/1Z3A6N5ck3c?t=2240) greatest desire and they don't choose\
[0:37:21](https://youtu.be/1Z3A6N5ck3c?t=2241) what their greatest desire is now maybe\
[0:37:25](https://youtu.be/1Z3A6N5ck3c?t=2245) you were to chose strawberry but your\
[0:37:26](https://youtu.be/1Z3A6N5ck3c?t=2246) environment only allows you to choices\
[0:37:28](https://youtu.be/1Z3A6N5ck3c?t=2248) right and now we trace back the choice\
[0:37:32](https://youtu.be/1Z3A6N5ck3c?t=2252) to environment it's always nature or\
[0:37:34](https://youtu.be/1Z3A6N5ck3c?t=2254) nurture nature or nature and then in\
[0:37:37](https://youtu.be/1Z3A6N5ck3c?t=2257) science and in philosophy we have\
[0:37:39](https://youtu.be/1Z3A6N5ck3c?t=2259) something called epiphenomenalism\
[0:37:40](https://youtu.be/1Z3A6N5ck3c?t=2260) epiphenomenalism means that because of\
[0:37:43](https://youtu.be/1Z3A6N5ck3c?t=2263) determinism this little example I gave\
[0:37:45](https://youtu.be/1Z3A6N5ck3c?t=2265) you because of Laplace the billiard ball\
[0:37:47](https://youtu.be/1Z3A6N5ck3c?t=2267) theory because everything is pushing\
[0:37:50](https://youtu.be/1Z3A6N5ck3c?t=2270) everything else physics is a causal\
[0:37:51](https://youtu.be/1Z3A6N5ck3c?t=2271) chain yeah and your genetics were given\
[0:37:54](https://youtu.be/1Z3A6N5ck3c?t=2274) to you because of your parents you\
[0:37:55](https://youtu.be/1Z3A6N5ck3c?t=2275) didn't choose your parents and so on and\
[0:37:56](https://youtu.be/1Z3A6N5ck3c?t=2276) so forth and you were born in this\
[0:37:58](https://youtu.be/1Z3A6N5ck3c?t=2278) country and this is your environment you\
[0:37:59](https://youtu.be/1Z3A6N5ck3c?t=2279) didn't choose your environment all these\
[0:38:01](https://youtu.be/1Z3A6N5ck3c?t=2281) things are out of your control and your\
[0:38:02](https://youtu.be/1Z3A6N5ck3c?t=2282) behavior is based on these two things\
[0:38:04](https://youtu.be/1Z3A6N5ck3c?t=2284) and these two things are out of your\
[0:38:05](https://youtu.be/1Z3A6N5ck3c?t=2285) control therefore your behavior is out\
[0:38:06](https://youtu.be/1Z3A6N5ck3c?t=2286) of your control yeah yet in\
[0:38:11](https://youtu.be/1Z3A6N5ck3c?t=2291) epiphenomenalism they tell you when you\
[0:38:13](https://youtu.be/1Z3A6N5ck3c?t=2293) reach for a glass of water mmm\
[0:38:14](https://youtu.be/1Z3A6N5ck3c?t=2294) they say your your desire to reach for a\
[0:38:17](https://youtu.be/1Z3A6N5ck3c?t=2297) glass your your your your will you know\
[0:38:19](https://youtu.be/1Z3A6N5ck3c?t=2299) your your free will the thing you're\
[0:38:21](https://youtu.be/1Z3A6N5ck3c?t=2301) telling me about for you when you reach\
[0:38:23](https://youtu.be/1Z3A6N5ck3c?t=2303) for it was irrelevant we knew you were\
[0:38:24](https://youtu.be/1Z3A6N5ck3c?t=2304) gonna reach for that glass of water\
[0:38:26](https://youtu.be/1Z3A6N5ck3c?t=2306) we could calculate we could look into\
[0:38:27](https://youtu.be/1Z3A6N5ck3c?t=2307) your mind and calculate all those\
[0:38:30](https://youtu.be/1Z3A6N5ck3c?t=2310) billiard balls we can know your genetics\
[0:38:32](https://youtu.be/1Z3A6N5ck3c?t=2312) one day we'll compute your genetics well\
[0:38:34](https://youtu.be/1Z3A6N5ck3c?t=2314) say Muhammad ejobs gonna walk in this\
[0:38:36](https://youtu.be/1Z3A6N5ck3c?t=2316) restaurant at 5 o'clock he's gonna sit\
[0:38:38](https://youtu.be/1Z3A6N5ck3c?t=2318) here he's gonna ask for a different\
[0:38:39](https://youtu.be/1Z3A6N5ck3c?t=2319) flavor we're gonna tell him knowing he's\
[0:38:41](https://youtu.be/1Z3A6N5ck3c?t=2321) gonna end up choosing vanilla we could\
[0:38:43](https://youtu.be/1Z3A6N5ck3c?t=2323) predict everything hmm and it would be\
[0:38:46](https://youtu.be/1Z3A6N5ck3c?t=2326) right now where does that leave free\
[0:38:50](https://youtu.be/1Z3A6N5ck3c?t=2330) will because I've net said let's use me\
[0:38:52](https://youtu.be/1Z3A6N5ck3c?t=2332) Leibniz said that contradicts my\
[0:38:54](https://youtu.be/1Z3A6N5ck3c?t=2334) experience I'm not this robot hmm\
[0:38:57](https://youtu.be/1Z3A6N5ck3c?t=2337) because it would be basically you're a\
[0:38:59](https://youtu.be/1Z3A6N5ck3c?t=2339) robot or that life is a rollercoaster\
[0:39:01](https://youtu.be/1Z3A6N5ck3c?t=2341) kind of thing you're on the track\
[0:39:03](https://youtu.be/1Z3A6N5ck3c?t=2343) yeah but what what physics is saying is\
[0:39:06](https://youtu.be/1Z3A6N5ck3c?t=2346) look how many job you are exactly like a\
[0:39:08](https://youtu.be/1Z3A6N5ck3c?t=2348) robot if we know your algorithm we know\
[0:39:11](https://youtu.be/1Z3A6N5ck3c?t=2351) exactly what decisions you will make\
[0:39:13](https://youtu.be/1Z3A6N5ck3c?t=2353) anything we would say is randomness is\
[0:39:16](https://youtu.be/1Z3A6N5ck3c?t=2356) really a truly a limit of our thought\
[0:39:17](https://youtu.be/1Z3A6N5ck3c?t=2357) ability to think to compute if we had a\
[0:39:21](https://youtu.be/1Z3A6N5ck3c?t=2361) divine calculator we would know exactly\
[0:39:24](https://youtu.be/1Z3A6N5ck3c?t=2364) everything okay but when I sit down I\
[0:39:28](https://youtu.be/1Z3A6N5ck3c?t=2368) feel like I'm having a choice now how do\
[0:39:31](https://youtu.be/1Z3A6N5ck3c?t=2371) I know that I feel like I having a\
[0:39:33](https://youtu.be/1Z3A6N5ck3c?t=2373) choice what method am I using am I using\
[0:39:35](https://youtu.be/1Z3A6N5ck3c?t=2375) a scientific method a logical method\
[0:39:37](https://youtu.be/1Z3A6N5ck3c?t=2377) meeting mathematics or am i using\
[0:39:39](https://youtu.be/1Z3A6N5ck3c?t=2379) intuition tuition intuition I feel like\
[0:39:44](https://youtu.be/1Z3A6N5ck3c?t=2384) this story you just gave me is BS I\
[0:39:47](https://youtu.be/1Z3A6N5ck3c?t=2387) don't believe this robot theory right\
[0:39:49](https://youtu.be/1Z3A6N5ck3c?t=2389) you know what I chose vanilla all right\
[0:39:52](https://youtu.be/1Z3A6N5ck3c?t=2392) and my intuition is just as true or if\
[0:39:54](https://youtu.be/1Z3A6N5ck3c?t=2394) not it's actually more - I'm more\
[0:39:56](https://youtu.be/1Z3A6N5ck3c?t=2396) confident because I'm feeling it\
[0:39:58](https://youtu.be/1Z3A6N5ck3c?t=2398) directly all your science is an\
[0:40:00](https://youtu.be/1Z3A6N5ck3c?t=2400) interpretation of patterns and\
[0:40:01](https://youtu.be/1Z3A6N5ck3c?t=2401) regularities you have a faith based\
[0:40:02](https://youtu.be/1Z3A6N5ck3c?t=2402) system system that did the history the\
[0:40:05](https://youtu.be/1Z3A6N5ck3c?t=2405) future will behave like the past mmm how\
[0:40:10](https://youtu.be/1Z3A6N5ck3c?t=2410) did lime let's melt these two together\
[0:40:11](https://youtu.be/1Z3A6N5ck3c?t=2411) he said look Hegel would say that's an\
[0:40:14](https://youtu.be/1Z3A6N5ck3c?t=2414) apparent contradiction when things seem\
[0:40:15](https://youtu.be/1Z3A6N5ck3c?t=2415) they cannot be reconciled but they can\
[0:40:17](https://youtu.be/1Z3A6N5ck3c?t=2417) be it seems it cannot be reconciled\
[0:40:20](https://youtu.be/1Z3A6N5ck3c?t=2420) whether it can be but they can't be so\
[0:40:22](https://youtu.be/1Z3A6N5ck3c?t=2422) liveness of course life that comes to\
[0:40:24](https://youtu.be/1Z3A6N5ck3c?t=2424) the rescue in quite often in the history\
[0:40:26](https://youtu.be/1Z3A6N5ck3c?t=2426) and philosophy many great thinkers did I\
[0:40:27](https://youtu.be/1Z3A6N5ck3c?t=2427) don't want to just give liveness as a as\
[0:40:29](https://youtu.be/1Z3A6N5ck3c?t=2429) an example Leibniz coined it beautifully\
[0:40:31](https://youtu.be/1Z3A6N5ck3c?t=2431) and I always like to quote the person\
[0:40:32](https://youtu.be/1Z3A6N5ck3c?t=2432) who coined it very beautifully because\
[0:40:35](https://youtu.be/1Z3A6N5ck3c?t=2435) you know in in\
[0:40:36](https://youtu.be/1Z3A6N5ck3c?t=2436) in Islam we say you're determined the\
[0:40:40](https://youtu.be/1Z3A6N5ck3c?t=2440) Sahaba even asked the Prophet if we're\
[0:40:41](https://youtu.be/1Z3A6N5ck3c?t=2441) determined why salon it was Sammy said\
[0:40:43](https://youtu.be/1Z3A6N5ck3c?t=2443) I'm a little do you know dude I make\
[0:40:46](https://youtu.be/1Z3A6N5ck3c?t=2446) action man asked him should I tie my\
[0:40:48](https://youtu.be/1Z3A6N5ck3c?t=2448) camel or shares-a-lot take care of it\

[0:41:04](https://youtu.be/1Z3A6N5ck3c?t=2464) together at all they're just\
[0:41:05](https://youtu.be/1Z3A6N5ck3c?t=2465) synchronized they're operating\
[0:41:07](https://youtu.be/1Z3A6N5ck3c?t=2467) independently but they're synchronized\
[0:41:08](https://youtu.be/1Z3A6N5ck3c?t=2468) hmm okay so these two trains if you\
[0:41:13](https://youtu.be/1Z3A6N5ck3c?t=2473) looked at from bird's-eye view you think\
[0:41:14](https://youtu.be/1Z3A6N5ck3c?t=2474) they're connected you get closer to them\
[0:41:17](https://youtu.be/1Z3A6N5ck3c?t=2477) and you see no they're not connected\

[0:41:33](https://youtu.be/1Z3A6N5ck3c?t=2493) your your consciousness is not part of\
[0:41:35](https://youtu.be/1Z3A6N5ck3c?t=2495) the machine hmm\
[0:41:37](https://youtu.be/1Z3A6N5ck3c?t=2497) remember we talked about in another\
[0:41:40](https://youtu.be/1Z3A6N5ck3c?t=2500) video about if I walked around in your\
[0:41:42](https://youtu.be/1Z3A6N5ck3c?t=2502) brain I would see all the mission\
[0:41:43](https://youtu.be/1Z3A6N5ck3c?t=2503) machinery of your brain but I wouldn't\
[0:41:45](https://youtu.be/1Z3A6N5ck3c?t=2505) see your consciousness I wouldn't see\
[0:41:46](https://youtu.be/1Z3A6N5ck3c?t=2506) your first-person experience\
[0:41:47](https://youtu.be/1Z3A6N5ck3c?t=2507) yeah I wouldn't see all the thoughts you\
[0:41:49](https://youtu.be/1Z3A6N5ck3c?t=2509) have I wouldn't see that what it is to\
[0:41:51](https://youtu.be/1Z3A6N5ck3c?t=2511) be you that's you only know what\
[0:41:52](https://youtu.be/1Z3A6N5ck3c?t=2512) intuitively we don't know that\
[0:41:53](https://youtu.be/1Z3A6N5ck3c?t=2513) scientifically hmm he said look that\
[0:41:55](https://youtu.be/1Z3A6N5ck3c?t=2515) intuition the part of mine that spirit\
[0:41:58](https://youtu.be/1Z3A6N5ck3c?t=2518) that consciousness that immaterial part\
[0:42:01](https://youtu.be/1Z3A6N5ck3c?t=2521) of me that metaphysical part of me isn't\
[0:42:03](https://youtu.be/1Z3A6N5ck3c?t=2523) harmony my arm is moving and my will\
[0:42:06](https://youtu.be/1Z3A6N5ck3c?t=2526) which is not moving my arm they're just\
[0:42:08](https://youtu.be/1Z3A6N5ck3c?t=2528) in harmony they're anomaly and I bring\
[0:42:11](https://youtu.be/1Z3A6N5ck3c?t=2531) that water and I drink it hmm or they\
[0:42:14](https://youtu.be/1Z3A6N5ck3c?t=2534) eat that ice cream or whatever you did\
[0:42:15](https://youtu.be/1Z3A6N5ck3c?t=2535) hmm he says that harmony we asked him oh\
[0:42:18](https://youtu.be/1Z3A6N5ck3c?t=2538) how does his harmony come about he says\
[0:42:19](https://youtu.be/1Z3A6N5ck3c?t=2539) God God basically saying to you took the\
[0:42:23](https://youtu.be/1Z3A6N5ck3c?t=2543) greatest pool shot in history okay\
[0:42:27](https://youtu.be/1Z3A6N5ck3c?t=2547) everything is harmony now in Quran and\
[0:42:29](https://youtu.be/1Z3A6N5ck3c?t=2549) Islam this is perfect because anything\
[0:42:32](https://youtu.be/1Z3A6N5ck3c?t=2552) outside the will of Allah yeah but at\
[0:42:34](https://youtu.be/1Z3A6N5ck3c?t=2554) same time there is the the whole idea of\
[0:42:36](https://youtu.be/1Z3A6N5ck3c?t=2556) freewill as well\
[0:42:36](https://youtu.be/1Z3A6N5ck3c?t=2556) there's idea freewill yes but there's\
[0:42:40](https://youtu.be/1Z3A6N5ck3c?t=2560) there's a condition\
[0:42:41](https://youtu.be/1Z3A6N5ck3c?t=2561) yes if I go to shoot you and then you\
[0:42:44](https://youtu.be/1Z3A6N5ck3c?t=2564) can jams yes a cutter Allah yeah\
[0:42:46](https://youtu.be/1Z3A6N5ck3c?t=2566) my will was to kill you yes but Allah\
[0:42:49](https://youtu.be/1Z3A6N5ck3c?t=2569) didn't will it there wasn't the harmony\
[0:42:51](https://youtu.be/1Z3A6N5ck3c?t=2571) mmm but yet still no contradiction yeah\
[0:42:54](https://youtu.be/1Z3A6N5ck3c?t=2574) contradictions cannot exist yes that's\
[0:42:56](https://youtu.be/1Z3A6N5ck3c?t=2576) how we know truth exists people say our\
[0:42:58](https://youtu.be/1Z3A6N5ck3c?t=2578) truth is relative know if truth was\
[0:43:00](https://youtu.be/1Z3A6N5ck3c?t=2580) relative contradictions would exist we\
[0:43:02](https://youtu.be/1Z3A6N5ck3c?t=2582) know contradictions do not an\
[0:43:04](https://youtu.be/1Z3A6N5ck3c?t=2584) interesting refutation of relative\
[0:43:06](https://youtu.be/1Z3A6N5ck3c?t=2586) absolute listen and one day we'll do a\
[0:43:08](https://youtu.be/1Z3A6N5ck3c?t=2588) video on just the book of gory gets from\

[0:45:53](https://youtu.be/1Z3A6N5ck3c?t=2753) unlike me man\
[0:45:55](https://youtu.be/1Z3A6N5ck3c?t=2755) so she said that she was going to the\
[0:45:58](https://youtu.be/1Z3A6N5ck3c?t=2758) madhouse she went to she was committed\
[0:45:59](https://youtu.be/1Z3A6N5ck3c?t=2759) mmm because her life was just shed\
[0:46:02](https://youtu.be/1Z3A6N5ck3c?t=2762) depression and then one day she said she\
[0:46:04](https://youtu.be/1Z3A6N5ck3c?t=2764) had an epiphany she writes books now\

[0:46:13](https://youtu.be/1Z3A6N5ck3c?t=2773) the conclusion that you know what\
[0:46:14](https://youtu.be/1Z3A6N5ck3c?t=2774) there's God's business and there's my\
[0:46:15](https://youtu.be/1Z3A6N5ck3c?t=2775) business and I'm never gonna object to\
[0:46:17](https://youtu.be/1Z3A6N5ck3c?t=2777) God's business again yeah so she went\
[0:46:19](https://youtu.be/1Z3A6N5ck3c?t=2779) back home and she saw her kids socks on\
[0:46:21](https://youtu.be/1Z3A6N5ck3c?t=2781) the floor she says she for years she\
[0:46:23](https://youtu.be/1Z3A6N5ck3c?t=2783) fought with them to pick up their socks\
[0:46:25](https://youtu.be/1Z3A6N5ck3c?t=2785) now she said you know what I'm just\
[0:46:26](https://youtu.be/1Z3A6N5ck3c?t=2786) gonna pick it up and if her daughter\
[0:46:28](https://youtu.be/1Z3A6N5ck3c?t=2788) gave her bad news it wouldn't it wasn't\

[0:46:39](https://youtu.be/1Z3A6N5ck3c?t=2799) grandson once upon a time was dying in\
[0:46:41](https://youtu.be/1Z3A6N5ck3c?t=2801) her arms and she didn't let the fact\
[0:46:43](https://youtu.be/1Z3A6N5ck3c?t=2803) that he's dying spoiled it she said look\
[0:46:45](https://youtu.be/1Z3A6N5ck3c?t=2805) if he lives or dies that's God's\
[0:46:46](https://youtu.be/1Z3A6N5ck3c?t=2806) business the part the medics are doing\
[0:46:48](https://youtu.be/1Z3A6N5ck3c?t=2808) what they can't can do\

[0:47:08](https://youtu.be/1Z3A6N5ck3c?t=2828) is a plan there's a plan but there was a\
[0:47:10](https://youtu.be/1Z3A6N5ck3c?t=2830) submission on her part yeah she yielded\

[0:47:25](https://youtu.be/1Z3A6N5ck3c?t=2845) I will not interpret as a calamity\
[0:47:26](https://youtu.be/1Z3A6N5ck3c?t=2846) I refuse to it's your bet you did this\
[0:47:29](https://youtu.be/1Z3A6N5ck3c?t=2849) it's out of my control so this is it\
[0:47:31](https://youtu.be/1Z3A6N5ck3c?t=2851) whatever is in your control do it be in\
[0:47:33](https://youtu.be/1Z3A6N5ck3c?t=2853) harmony\
[0:47:34](https://youtu.be/1Z3A6N5ck3c?t=2854) whatever is out of your control don't\
[0:47:36](https://youtu.be/1Z3A6N5ck3c?t=2856) say you like it or you dislike be in\
[0:47:38](https://youtu.be/1Z3A6N5ck3c?t=2858) harmony with it and accept it this is\
[0:47:40](https://youtu.be/1Z3A6N5ck3c?t=2860) what I understand from what I've\
[0:47:41](https://youtu.be/1Z3A6N5ck3c?t=2861) understood myself and understood it you\
[0:47:43](https://youtu.be/1Z3A6N5ck3c?t=2863) know again I'm very beginning this makes\
[0:47:46](https://youtu.be/1Z3A6N5ck3c?t=2866) why I would say it's the name Islam is\
[0:47:49](https://youtu.be/1Z3A6N5ck3c?t=2869) one maybe one reason it makes sense its\
[0:47:51](https://youtu.be/1Z3A6N5ck3c?t=2871) submission to the will there must be a\
[0:47:53](https://youtu.be/1Z3A6N5ck3c?t=2873) synchrony a yielding a yielding I should\
[0:47:55](https://youtu.be/1Z3A6N5ck3c?t=2875) say a yielding and again this is very\
[0:47:57](https://youtu.be/1Z3A6N5ck3c?t=2877) complicated topics and I think that that\
[0:48:00](https://youtu.be/1Z3A6N5ck3c?t=2880) last pool example is I think both\
[0:48:02](https://youtu.be/1Z3A6N5ck3c?t=2882) examples lightness examples after you\
[0:48:04](https://youtu.be/1Z3A6N5ck3c?t=2884) think about them you might not have\
[0:48:06](https://youtu.be/1Z3A6N5ck3c?t=2886) understood them straight away but if you\
[0:48:07](https://youtu.be/1Z3A6N5ck3c?t=2887) think about them with a little bit of\
[0:48:08](https://youtu.be/1Z3A6N5ck3c?t=2888) thought and kind of live mature and\
[0:48:11](https://youtu.be/1Z3A6N5ck3c?t=2891) ferment in your mind a little bit I\
[0:48:12](https://youtu.be/1Z3A6N5ck3c?t=2892) think it will actually have a real\
[0:48:14](https://youtu.be/1Z3A6N5ck3c?t=2894) resonating effect on you so do you think\
[0:48:16](https://youtu.be/1Z3A6N5ck3c?t=2896) about it's really interesting how to put\
[0:48:18](https://youtu.be/1Z3A6N5ck3c?t=2898) the two things together kind of like\
[0:48:19](https://youtu.be/1Z3A6N5ck3c?t=2899) free will and determinism and how it can\
[0:48:22](https://youtu.be/1Z3A6N5ck3c?t=2902) seem like a contradiction when you do\
[0:48:24](https://youtu.be/1Z3A6N5ck3c?t=2904) put them together it can become very\
[0:48:25](https://youtu.be/1Z3A6N5ck3c?t=2905) very powerful but if you object to any\
[0:48:29](https://youtu.be/1Z3A6N5ck3c?t=2909) of these ideas show us one instance of\
[0:48:32](https://youtu.be/1Z3A6N5ck3c?t=2912) true randomness oh yeah somebody can\
[0:48:37](https://youtu.be/1Z3A6N5ck3c?t=2917) show one example of actual randomness of\
[0:48:39](https://youtu.be/1Z3A6N5ck3c?t=2919) actual randomly earth that's not a\
[0:48:41](https://youtu.be/1Z3A6N5ck3c?t=2921) reflection of our ignorance nobody in\
[0:48:43](https://youtu.be/1Z3A6N5ck3c?t=2923) history has done it so far maybe\
[0:48:45](https://youtu.be/1Z3A6N5ck3c?t=2925) somebody out there will mmm who knows\
[0:48:47](https://youtu.be/1Z3A6N5ck3c?t=2927) I personally visit it's logically\
[0:48:49](https://youtu.be/1Z3A6N5ck3c?t=2929) impossible yeah but again I've made\
[0:48:52](https://youtu.be/1Z3A6N5ck3c?t=2932) mistakes in the past and I'm sure yeah\
