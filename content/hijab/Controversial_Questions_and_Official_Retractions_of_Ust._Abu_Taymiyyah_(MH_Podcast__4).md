<a onclick="modifyYTiframeseektime('148')">0:02:28</a> comes with a lot of rewards as well  
<a onclick="modifyYTiframeseektime('150')">0:02:30</a> as the messenger sallallahu alaihi with  
<a onclick="modifyYTiframeseektime('151')">0:02:31</a> some said men died  
<a onclick="modifyYTiframeseektime('154')">0:02:34</a> canada  
<a onclick="modifyYTiframeseektime('157')">0:02:37</a> okay whoever calls the guidance for him  
<a onclick="modifyYTiframeseektime('159')">0:02:39</a> is the reward of everyone that follows  
<a onclick="modifyYTiframeseektime('161')">0:02:41</a> him up on that guidance  
<a onclick="modifyYTiframeseektime('162')">0:02:42</a> and he won't take anything away from him  
<a onclick="modifyYTiframeseektime('164')">0:02:44</a> and then look what he also said

<a onclick="modifyYTiframeseektime('180')">0:03:00</a> okay so it can work both ways  
<a onclick="modifyYTiframeseektime('183')">0:03:03</a> you can maybe even call it a  
<a onclick="modifyYTiframeseektime('184')">0:03:04</a> double-edged sword right so he requires  
<a onclick="modifyYTiframeseektime('187')">0:03:07</a> time it requires patience  
<a onclick="modifyYTiframeseektime('195')">0:03:15</a> we shouldn't try to be kind of like  
<a onclick="modifyYTiframeseektime('196')">0:03:16</a> hasty and wanting to be out  
<a onclick="modifyYTiframeseektime('199')">0:03:19</a> i remember also the shaykh of

<a onclick="modifyYTiframeseektime('205')">0:03:25</a> take the knowledge  
<a onclick="modifyYTiframeseektime('206')">0:03:26</a> and to pour it into your mouth the same  
<a onclick="modifyYTiframeseektime('209')">0:03:29</a> way

<a onclick="modifyYTiframeseektime('215')">0:03:35</a> then i would have done that but the only  
<a onclick="modifyYTiframeseektime('217')">0:03:37</a> way you're going to attain knowledge is  
<a onclick="modifyYTiframeseektime('219')">0:03:39</a> by the scraping of the knees and the  
<a onclick="modifyYTiframeseektime('220')">0:03:40</a> scraping of

<a onclick="modifyYTiframeseektime('300')">0:05:00</a> going to be chasing the impossible  
<a onclick="modifyYTiframeseektime('306')">0:05:06</a> okay you want to become honored you want  
<a onclick="modifyYTiframeseektime('310')">0:05:10</a> a high position

<a onclick="modifyYTiframeseektime('314')">0:05:14</a> gives the example of somebody who's  
<a onclick="modifyYTiframeseektime('316')">0:05:16</a> ready to risk his life  
<a onclick="modifyYTiframeseektime('318')">0:05:18</a> he dives into the sea to get the pearls  
<a onclick="modifyYTiframeseektime('320')">0:05:20</a> from under the sea right  
<a onclick="modifyYTiframeseektime('322')">0:05:22</a> what kind of risk would we be willing to  
<a onclick="modifyYTiframeseektime('324')">0:05:24</a> take to do something like that  
<a onclick="modifyYTiframeseektime('326')">0:05:26</a> so uh it's my yemen like  
<a onclick="modifyYTiframeseektime('329')">0:05:29</a> i remember when i first got to medina uh  
<a onclick="modifyYTiframeseektime('333')">0:05:33</a> a brother called sheikh abdul razakh who  
<a onclick="modifyYTiframeseektime('336')">0:05:36</a> i benefited from  
<a onclick="modifyYTiframeseektime('338')">0:05:38</a> in the hambury he took me into the dorms  
<a onclick="modifyYTiframeseektime('342')">0:05:42</a> and he said to me about him you're going  
<a onclick="modifyYTiframeseektime('344')">0:05:44</a> to struggle with these dorms  
<a onclick="modifyYTiframeseektime('346')">0:05:46</a> huh and i said to him we got running  
<a onclick="modifyYTiframeseektime('349')">0:05:49</a> water  
<a onclick="modifyYTiframeseektime('351')">0:05:51</a> we got running electricity we didn't  
<a onclick="modifyYTiframeseektime('352')">0:05:52</a> even have that here man  
<a onclick="modifyYTiframeseektime('354')">0:05:54</a> okay so sometimes you know going out  
<a onclick="modifyYTiframeseektime('357')">0:05:57</a> being in places like egypt mauritania  
<a onclick="modifyYTiframeseektime('360')">0:06:00</a> but yemen obviously now there's a lot of  
<a onclick="modifyYTiframeseektime('361')">0:06:01</a> issues in yemen  
<a onclick="modifyYTiframeseektime('363')">0:06:03</a> you're gonna have to put a lot of effort  
<a onclick="modifyYTiframeseektime('364')">0:06:04</a> in okay  
<a onclick="modifyYTiframeseektime('366')">0:06:06</a> and that which we come out with is  
<a onclick="modifyYTiframeseektime('368')">0:06:08</a> absolutely nothing  
<a onclick="modifyYTiframeseektime('370')">0:06:10</a> to uh what the self came out with  
<a onclick="modifyYTiframeseektime('373')">0:06:13</a> having gone through all of the  
<a onclick="modifyYTiframeseektime('375')">0:06:15</a> difficulties but anyways this is a  
<a onclick="modifyYTiframeseektime('378')">0:06:18</a> i don't want to prolong it but i've got  
<a onclick="modifyYTiframeseektime('380')">0:06:20</a> a video on my youtube channel it's  
<a onclick="modifyYTiframeseektime('381')">0:06:21</a> called he drank his urine  
<a onclick="modifyYTiframeseektime('383')">0:06:23</a> six times this was the case of some of  
<a onclick="modifyYTiframeseektime('386')">0:06:26</a> the people of the past they would drink  
<a onclick="modifyYTiframeseektime('387')">0:06:27</a> their urine because they would  
<a onclick="modifyYTiframeseektime('389')">0:06:29</a> out of what you call it uh necessity  
<a onclick="modifyYTiframeseektime('392')">0:06:32</a> because they're walking in the desert  
<a onclick="modifyYTiframeseektime('394')">0:06:34</a> they don't have no water they don't have  
<a onclick="modifyYTiframeseektime('395')">0:06:35</a> anything  
<a onclick="modifyYTiframeseektime('399')">0:06:39</a> so that's that's very subhanallah  
<a onclick="modifyYTiframeseektime('401')">0:06:41</a> motivating i think a lot of people will  
<a onclick="modifyYTiframeseektime('402')">0:06:42</a> take a lot of benefit in gems from that  
<a onclick="modifyYTiframeseektime('405')">0:06:45</a> especially those who live in you know  
<a onclick="modifyYTiframeseektime('407')">0:06:47</a> modern day  
<a onclick="modifyYTiframeseektime('408')">0:06:48</a> societies where everything is fast  
<a onclick="modifyYTiframeseektime('410')">0:06:50</a> everything is quick everything is  
<a onclick="modifyYTiframeseektime('411')">0:06:51</a> accessible  
<a onclick="modifyYTiframeseektime('413')">0:06:53</a> um and so for that that's very  
<a onclick="modifyYTiframeseektime('415')">0:06:55</a> insightful i want to move on to now is  
<a onclick="modifyYTiframeseektime('418')">0:06:58</a> perhaps on a lot of people's mind in  
<a onclick="modifyYTiframeseektime('420')">0:07:00</a> many ways  
<a onclick="modifyYTiframeseektime('421')">0:07:01</a> could be since the elephant in the room  
<a onclick="modifyYTiframeseektime('422')">0:07:02</a> which is  
<a onclick="modifyYTiframeseektime('424')">0:07:04</a> there's a lot of kind of um refutations  
<a onclick="modifyYTiframeseektime('428')">0:07:08</a> you want to call it that you're involved  
<a onclick="modifyYTiframeseektime('430')">0:07:10</a> in or that you are associated with  
<a onclick="modifyYTiframeseektime('432')">0:07:12</a> maybe not directly involved in yourself  
<a onclick="modifyYTiframeseektime('435')">0:07:15</a> um  
<a onclick="modifyYTiframeseektime('436')">0:07:16</a> some time ago you came speaks corner  
<a onclick="modifyYTiframeseektime('438')">0:07:18</a> there was some kind of drama between you  
<a onclick="modifyYTiframeseektime('440')">0:07:20</a> and  
<a onclick="modifyYTiframeseektime('440')">0:07:20</a> oshid and um it was surrounding the case  
<a onclick="modifyYTiframeseektime('443')">0:07:23</a> of  
<a onclick="modifyYTiframeseektime('445')">0:07:25</a> haddad and a particular video  
<a onclick="modifyYTiframeseektime('448')">0:07:28</a> that came out basically the shiite he  
<a onclick="modifyYTiframeseektime('451')">0:07:31</a> went to a  
<a onclick="modifyYTiframeseektime('452')">0:07:32</a> that that man put out which is that he  
<a onclick="modifyYTiframeseektime('454')">0:07:34</a> went to a place where he was discussing  
<a onclick="modifyYTiframeseektime('456')">0:07:36</a> with the shia and stuff like that and  
<a onclick="modifyYTiframeseektime('457')">0:07:37</a> then  
<a onclick="modifyYTiframeseektime('458')">0:07:38</a> you know from that there was all kinds  
<a onclick="modifyYTiframeseektime('460')">0:07:40</a> of conclusions that were made on his  
<a onclick="modifyYTiframeseektime('461')">0:07:41</a> character  
<a onclick="modifyYTiframeseektime('462')">0:07:42</a> do i just want to ask you a direct  
<a onclick="modifyYTiframeseektime('464')">0:07:44</a> question do were you involved in that  
<a onclick="modifyYTiframeseektime('465')">0:07:45</a> were you part of the  
<a onclick="modifyYTiframeseektime('467')">0:07:47</a> um the backing that dalman had for that  
<a onclick="modifyYTiframeseektime('470')">0:07:50</a> video do you agree with that do you  
<a onclick="modifyYTiframeseektime('471')">0:07:51</a> endorse that  
<a onclick="modifyYTiframeseektime('472')">0:07:52</a> do you think that that was something  
<a onclick="modifyYTiframeseektime('474')">0:07:54</a> which is uh fair  
<a onclick="modifyYTiframeseektime('476')">0:07:56</a> that was said about or do you think that  
<a onclick="modifyYTiframeseektime('479')">0:07:59</a> that's something that maybe shouldn't  
<a onclick="modifyYTiframeseektime('481')">0:08:01</a> have been done  
<a onclick="modifyYTiframeseektime('483')">0:08:03</a> so there's a number of things that we  
<a onclick="modifyYTiframeseektime('484')">0:08:04</a> can actually mention with regards to  
<a onclick="modifyYTiframeseektime('486')">0:08:06</a> that right  
<a onclick="modifyYTiframeseektime('487')">0:08:07</a> um because you asked a couple of  
<a onclick="modifyYTiframeseektime('489')">0:08:09</a> questions as well  
<a onclick="modifyYTiframeseektime('490')">0:08:10</a> did they or did he have the backing of  
<a onclick="modifyYTiframeseektime('492')">0:08:12</a> myself before he made the video  
<a onclick="modifyYTiframeseektime('494')">0:08:14</a> okay or was it just after and so on and  
<a onclick="modifyYTiframeseektime('497')">0:08:17</a> so forth right  
<a onclick="modifyYTiframeseektime('499')">0:08:19</a> um firstly um  
<a onclick="modifyYTiframeseektime('502')">0:08:22</a> i personally didn't know about the video  
<a onclick="modifyYTiframeseektime('504')">0:08:24</a> till after it came up  
<a onclick="modifyYTiframeseektime('506')">0:08:26</a> i was hearing about a video that's going  
<a onclick="modifyYTiframeseektime('507')">0:08:27</a> to be released  
<a onclick="modifyYTiframeseektime('509')">0:08:29</a> okay did i know about it beforehand and  
<a onclick="modifyYTiframeseektime('512')">0:08:32</a> that is  
<a onclick="modifyYTiframeseektime('512')">0:08:32</a> that's not correct and i know now  
<a onclick="modifyYTiframeseektime('514')">0:08:34</a> obviously um  
<a onclick="modifyYTiframeseektime('516')">0:08:36</a> because of a video that went out between  
<a onclick="modifyYTiframeseektime('518')">0:08:38</a> him and sajid i didn't even know they  
<a onclick="modifyYTiframeseektime('520')">0:08:40</a> were making that video  
<a onclick="modifyYTiframeseektime('521')">0:08:41</a> but it comes across there that the team  
<a onclick="modifyYTiframeseektime('524')">0:08:44</a> was this  
<a onclick="modifyYTiframeseektime('525')">0:08:45</a> was it was consulted and um  
<a onclick="modifyYTiframeseektime('528')">0:08:48</a> and also my name was mentioned uh in  
<a onclick="modifyYTiframeseektime('530')">0:08:50</a> good light by both of the brothers  
<a onclick="modifyYTiframeseektime('532')">0:08:52</a> so one could easily think that i kind of  
<a onclick="modifyYTiframeseektime('536')">0:08:56</a> authorized it  
<a onclick="modifyYTiframeseektime('537')">0:08:57</a> which i didn't okay um  
<a onclick="modifyYTiframeseektime('541')">0:09:01</a> but there is mistakes that i did and i'm  
<a onclick="modifyYTiframeseektime('543')">0:09:03</a> not just gonna like throw somebody under  
<a onclick="modifyYTiframeseektime('545')">0:09:05</a> the bus and kind of free myself and just  
<a onclick="modifyYTiframeseektime('547')">0:09:07</a> you know run away from the situation  
<a onclick="modifyYTiframeseektime('550')">0:09:10</a> uh there is mistakes that i did  
<a onclick="modifyYTiframeseektime('554')">0:09:14</a> that i really really really regret and i  
<a onclick="modifyYTiframeseektime('558')">0:09:18</a> began to think more about it  
<a onclick="modifyYTiframeseektime('560')">0:09:20</a> when i got to medina because when there  
<a onclick="modifyYTiframeseektime('562')">0:09:22</a> is  
<a onclick="modifyYTiframeseektime('563')">0:09:23</a> um a lot of battles taking place and  
<a onclick="modifyYTiframeseektime('565')">0:09:25</a> you're on the ground  
<a onclick="modifyYTiframeseektime('566')">0:09:26</a> it's like a war zone right and sometimes  
<a onclick="modifyYTiframeseektime('568')">0:09:28</a> it doesn't really allow you to  
<a onclick="modifyYTiframeseektime('570')">0:09:30</a> just think outside of the box but when  
<a onclick="modifyYTiframeseektime('573')">0:09:33</a> you kind of like  
<a onclick="modifyYTiframeseektime('574')">0:09:34</a> just step out it allows you to look at  
<a onclick="modifyYTiframeseektime('576')">0:09:36</a> things in a better perspective  
<a onclick="modifyYTiframeseektime('578')">0:09:38</a> okay so um and of course that incident  
<a onclick="modifyYTiframeseektime('582')">0:09:42</a> with adnan oshida happened just before  
<a onclick="modifyYTiframeseektime('584')">0:09:44</a> i went to medina like i wasn't planning  
<a onclick="modifyYTiframeseektime('586')">0:09:46</a> to go to hyde park

<a onclick="modifyYTiframeseektime('622')">0:10:22</a> i just really just started thinking

<a onclick="modifyYTiframeseektime('676')">0:11:16</a> and there's no need for me to mention  
<a onclick="modifyYTiframeseektime('677')">0:11:17</a> now because and my journey is

<a onclick="modifyYTiframeseektime('699')">0:11:39</a> becoming inflated right  
<a onclick="modifyYTiframeseektime('702')">0:11:42</a> so he said this to him i want to meet

<a onclick="modifyYTiframeseektime('748')">0:12:28</a> you know every now and again it would  
<a onclick="modifyYTiframeseektime('750')">0:12:30</a> just come back to life again  
<a onclick="modifyYTiframeseektime('752')">0:12:32</a> like in the haram being in the haram

<a onclick="modifyYTiframeseektime('769')">0:12:49</a> medina is like a central point for  
<a onclick="modifyYTiframeseektime('771')">0:12:51</a> muslims to come right

<a onclick="modifyYTiframeseektime('855')">0:14:15</a> i think about it for a moment i don't  
<a onclick="modifyYTiframeseektime('858')">0:14:18</a> think any of us

<a onclick="modifyYTiframeseektime('889')">0:14:49</a> knowledge is too vast  
<a onclick="modifyYTiframeseektime('892')">0:14:52</a> but in terms of  
<a onclick="modifyYTiframeseektime('905')">0:15:05</a> and you're not carrying the burden of  
<a onclick="modifyYTiframeseektime('906')">0:15:06</a> having taken lives

<a onclick="modifyYTiframeseektime('914')">0:15:14</a> of the people  
<a onclick="modifyYTiframeseektime('918')">0:15:18</a> and you've managed to refrain your  
<a onclick="modifyYTiframeseektime('920')">0:15:20</a> tongue from the  
<a onclick="modifyYTiframeseektime('922')">0:15:22</a> you know the uh the honor of people  
<a onclick="modifyYTiframeseektime('923')">0:15:23</a> right lazy

<a onclick="modifyYTiframeseektime('929')">0:15:29</a> congregation of the muslims  
<a onclick="modifyYTiframeseektime('931')">0:15:31</a> then do so he could have told talk to  
<a onclick="modifyYTiframeseektime('934')">0:15:34</a> him about anything  
<a onclick="modifyYTiframeseektime('936')">0:15:36</a> look what he's actually advising him  
<a onclick="modifyYTiframeseektime('938')">0:15:38</a> about okay  
<a onclick="modifyYTiframeseektime('941')">0:15:41</a> and that's not a lie man it really  
<a onclick="modifyYTiframeseektime('943')">0:15:43</a> really isn't a light matter  
<a onclick="modifyYTiframeseektime('945')">0:15:45</a> and so you're studying at the same time  
<a onclick="modifyYTiframeseektime('949')">0:15:49</a> you know the evidence is about  
<a onclick="modifyYTiframeseektime('950')">0:15:50</a> volume about oppression having said  
<a onclick="modifyYTiframeseektime('953')">0:15:53</a> something that you shouldn't have said  
<a onclick="modifyYTiframeseektime('955')">0:15:55</a> because just because somebody is wrong  
<a onclick="modifyYTiframeseektime('958')">0:15:58</a> in something  
<a onclick="modifyYTiframeseektime('959')">0:15:59</a> it doesn't justify you now to start  
<a onclick="modifyYTiframeseektime('961')">0:16:01</a> pinning up against him everything else  
<a onclick="modifyYTiframeseektime('964')">0:16:04</a> okay refutations are part of our  
<a onclick="modifyYTiframeseektime('966')">0:16:06</a> religion okay  
<a onclick="modifyYTiframeseektime('968')">0:16:08</a> it's something that the sharia uh  
<a onclick="modifyYTiframeseektime('971')">0:16:11</a> calls to is something that is mentioned  
<a onclick="modifyYTiframeseektime('973')">0:16:13</a> in a hadith there's something that the  
<a onclick="modifyYTiframeseektime('974')">0:16:14</a> messenger  
<a onclick="modifyYTiframeseektime('975')">0:16:15</a> wasn't done the companion has done it  
<a onclick="modifyYTiframeseektime('976')">0:16:16</a> those who came after them they ordered  
<a onclick="modifyYTiframeseektime('978')">0:16:18</a> it  
<a onclick="modifyYTiframeseektime('978')">0:16:18</a> okay and even ibrutinib  
<a onclick="modifyYTiframeseektime('982')">0:16:22</a> he mentions some very very very powerful  
<a onclick="modifyYTiframeseektime('984')">0:16:24</a> statements he says  
<a onclick="modifyYTiframeseektime('991')">0:16:31</a> the coolest innovation their scholars  
<a onclick="modifyYTiframeseektime('995')">0:16:35</a> are more dangerous upon the ummah than  
<a onclick="modifyYTiframeseektime('998')">0:16:38</a> the people of the  
<a onclick="modifyYTiframeseektime('998')">0:16:38</a> noob the people who sin then he then  
<a onclick="modifyYTiframeseektime('1001')">0:16:41</a> says  
<a onclick="modifyYTiframeseektime('1008')">0:16:48</a> this is the messenger commanded to kill  
<a onclick="modifyYTiframeseektime('1011')">0:16:51</a> the khawaris the kharagis that's how  
<a onclick="modifyYTiframeseektime('1012')">0:16:52</a> they translate right  
<a onclick="modifyYTiframeseektime('1014')">0:16:54</a> or is there any other word that you guys  
<a onclick="modifyYTiframeseektime('1016')">0:16:56</a> use  
<a onclick="modifyYTiframeseektime('1018')">0:16:58</a> uh he commanded that they are killed but  
<a onclick="modifyYTiframeseektime('1020')">0:17:00</a> he said not to kill  
<a onclick="modifyYTiframeseektime('1022')">0:17:02</a> the oppressive  
<a onclick="modifyYTiframeseektime('1036')">0:17:16</a> is calling the people to innovation  
<a onclick="modifyYTiframeseektime('1039')">0:17:19</a> okay  
<a onclick="modifyYTiframeseektime('1043')">0:17:23</a> it is a must that his situation is  
<a onclick="modifyYTiframeseektime('1046')">0:17:26</a> clarified to the people  
<a onclick="modifyYTiframeseektime('1047')">0:17:27</a> okay and then he goes on to say well  
<a onclick="modifyYTiframeseektime('1053')">0:17:33</a> removing his harms is more  
<a onclick="modifyYTiframeseektime('1057')">0:17:37</a> better more greater okay  
<a onclick="modifyYTiframeseektime('1060')">0:17:40</a> then removing the harm of a highway  
<a onclick="modifyYTiframeseektime('1063')">0:17:43</a> bandit  
<a onclick="modifyYTiframeseektime('1065')">0:17:45</a> okay like for example muhammad let's be  
<a onclick="modifyYTiframeseektime('1068')">0:17:48</a> honest here if you see a pedophile  
<a onclick="modifyYTiframeseektime('1071')">0:17:51</a> who's going to do something to our kids  
<a onclick="modifyYTiframeseektime('1073')">0:17:53</a> right  
<a onclick="modifyYTiframeseektime('1074')">0:17:54</a> you're going to want the people from him  
<a onclick="modifyYTiframeseektime('1076')">0:17:56</a> right am i wrong saying that  
<a onclick="modifyYTiframeseektime('1079')">0:17:59</a> and this is something related to  
<a onclick="modifyYTiframeseektime('1082')">0:18:02</a> um the integrity of our loved ones and  
<a onclick="modifyYTiframeseektime('1085')">0:18:05</a> whatever have you and likewise if  
<a onclick="modifyYTiframeseektime('1087')">0:18:07</a> someone's going to steal something from  
<a onclick="modifyYTiframeseektime('1088')">0:18:08</a> you you're going to warn that person  
<a onclick="modifyYTiframeseektime('1090')">0:18:10</a> and adeen the religion of allah is far  
<a onclick="modifyYTiframeseektime('1093')">0:18:13</a> greater than this  
<a onclick="modifyYTiframeseektime('1094')">0:18:14</a> having said that having said that  
<a onclick="modifyYTiframeseektime('1098')">0:18:18</a> when rebuking it requires a lot of  
<a onclick="modifyYTiframeseektime('1100')">0:18:20</a> hikmah okay  
<a onclick="modifyYTiframeseektime('1102')">0:18:22</a> and this is exactly what i'm allowed to  
<a onclick="modifyYTiframeseektime('1104')">0:18:24</a> mention it goes  
<a onclick="modifyYTiframeseektime('1112')">0:18:32</a> it is to do that which is appropriate  
<a onclick="modifyYTiframeseektime('1114')">0:18:34</a> befitting okay  
<a onclick="modifyYTiframeseektime('1116')">0:18:36</a> in a manner that is befitting and also  
<a onclick="modifyYTiframeseektime('1118')">0:18:38</a> that time has to be befitting us all  
<a onclick="modifyYTiframeseektime('1120')">0:18:40</a> and they mention three pillars first  
<a onclick="modifyYTiframeseektime('1123')">0:18:43</a> pillar that he mentions  
<a onclick="modifyYTiframeseektime('1125')">0:18:45</a> he has to be done with knowledge and  
<a onclick="modifyYTiframeseektime('1127')">0:18:47</a> then he also mentions  
<a onclick="modifyYTiframeseektime('1130')">0:18:50</a> and then he mentions the three opposites  
<a onclick="modifyYTiframeseektime('1132')">0:18:52</a> and i'm going to comment to that  
<a onclick="modifyYTiframeseektime('1134')">0:18:54</a> okay it has to be done with knowledge  
<a onclick="modifyYTiframeseektime('1136')">0:18:56</a> you can't just basically say something  
<a onclick="modifyYTiframeseektime('1137')">0:18:57</a> about someone  
<a onclick="modifyYTiframeseektime('1138')">0:18:58</a> that is not true are you connecting this  
<a onclick="modifyYTiframeseektime('1140')">0:19:00</a> with um  
<a onclick="modifyYTiframeseektime('1141')">0:19:01</a> doctor yeah i'm gonna comment okay i'm  
<a onclick="modifyYTiframeseektime('1143')">0:19:03</a> gonna come into that right  
<a onclick="modifyYTiframeseektime('1145')">0:19:05</a> it's important that we mention this  
<a onclick="modifyYTiframeseektime('1146')">0:19:06</a> because it's a taboo topic  
<a onclick="modifyYTiframeseektime('1148')">0:19:08</a> and i believe sometimes there's two  
<a onclick="modifyYTiframeseektime('1150')">0:19:10</a> extremes on this matter right  
<a onclick="modifyYTiframeseektime('1153')">0:19:13</a> so it has to be done with knowledge then  
<a onclick="modifyYTiframeseektime('1154')">0:19:14</a> you have also  
<a onclick="modifyYTiframeseektime('1157')">0:19:17</a> which basically means not acting on  
<a onclick="modifyYTiframeseektime('1159')">0:19:19</a> emotions  
<a onclick="modifyYTiframeseektime('1160')">0:19:20</a> someone's upset you and he's angered you  
<a onclick="modifyYTiframeseektime('1165')">0:19:25</a> i mean they usually translate as  
<a onclick="modifyYTiframeseektime('1167')">0:19:27</a> forbearance okay forbearance  
<a onclick="modifyYTiframeseektime('1173')">0:19:33</a> okay like somebody's angry you don't  
<a onclick="modifyYTiframeseektime('1175')">0:19:35</a> rush to kind of like  
<a onclick="modifyYTiframeseektime('1176')">0:19:36</a> punishing him and holding him into  
<a onclick="modifyYTiframeseektime('1178')">0:19:38</a> account and then and that is  
<a onclick="modifyYTiframeseektime('1180')">0:19:40</a> to just think about things like slowly  
<a onclick="modifyYTiframeseektime('1183')">0:19:43</a> not to be hasty and rushing into it and  
<a onclick="modifyYTiframeseektime('1186')">0:19:46</a> i believe that  
<a onclick="modifyYTiframeseektime('1186')">0:19:46</a> i actually was very hasty just listening  
<a onclick="modifyYTiframeseektime('1190')">0:19:50</a> to one side and seeing some parts of  
<a onclick="modifyYTiframeseektime('1192')">0:19:52</a> some videos cut up  
<a onclick="modifyYTiframeseektime('1194')">0:19:54</a> and i take the full blame for them  
<a onclick="modifyYTiframeseektime('1200')">0:20:00</a> and we'll you know uh speak more about  
<a onclick="modifyYTiframeseektime('1202')">0:20:02</a> it in a bit insha'allah  
<a onclick="modifyYTiframeseektime('1204')">0:20:04</a> okay  
<a onclick="modifyYTiframeseektime('1214')">0:20:14</a> announcing things right okay and  
<a onclick="modifyYTiframeseektime('1217')">0:20:17</a> uh unveiling the secrets and of the  
<a onclick="modifyYTiframeseektime('1220')">0:20:20</a> discussions that happen and so on and so  
<a onclick="modifyYTiframeseektime('1222')">0:20:22</a> forth  
<a onclick="modifyYTiframeseektime('1222')">0:20:22</a> so just rushing into things you're in  
<a onclick="modifyYTiframeseektime('1225')">0:20:25</a> need of and  
<a onclick="modifyYTiframeseektime('1226')">0:20:26</a> and this is something that messenger  
<a onclick="modifyYTiframeseektime('1228')">0:20:28</a> sallallahu alaihi wasallam said that  
<a onclick="modifyYTiframeseektime('1229')">0:20:29</a> allah really loves when he was speaking  
<a onclick="modifyYTiframeseektime('1230')">0:20:30</a> to  
<a onclick="modifyYTiframeseektime('1231')">0:20:31</a> the place right in your  
<a onclick="modifyYTiframeseektime('1236')">0:20:36</a> and he mentioned the three opposite  
<a onclick="modifyYTiframeseektime('1237')">0:20:37</a> things of that he said ignorance  
<a onclick="modifyYTiframeseektime('1241')">0:20:41</a> unthoughtfulness i think that's how they  
<a onclick="modifyYTiframeseektime('1243')">0:20:43</a> translate right  
<a onclick="modifyYTiframeseektime('1244')">0:20:44</a> and uh hastiness  
<a onclick="modifyYTiframeseektime('1248')">0:20:48</a> so going back to what i was saying even  
<a onclick="modifyYTiframeseektime('1250')">0:20:50</a> if the guy is a kafir  
<a onclick="modifyYTiframeseektime('1252')">0:20:52</a> like you're a few atheists all the time  
<a onclick="modifyYTiframeseektime('1254')">0:20:54</a> right and you speak about  
<a onclick="modifyYTiframeseektime('1255')">0:20:55</a> the christians and i'm just bringing the  
<a onclick="modifyYTiframeseektime('1257')">0:20:57</a> worst example here  
<a onclick="modifyYTiframeseektime('1259')">0:20:59</a> if that christian  
<a onclick="modifyYTiframeseektime('1262')">0:21:02</a> believes that jesus is the son of god  
<a onclick="modifyYTiframeseektime('1264')">0:21:04</a> you are not allowed to say about him  
<a onclick="modifyYTiframeseektime('1265')">0:21:05</a> islamically speaking and this is the  
<a onclick="modifyYTiframeseektime('1267')">0:21:07</a> fairness that our religion came with  
<a onclick="modifyYTiframeseektime('1269')">0:21:09</a> that jose is the son of god  
<a onclick="modifyYTiframeseektime('1272')">0:21:12</a> you can't say about the individual what  
<a onclick="modifyYTiframeseektime('1275')">0:21:15</a> which has no  
<a onclick="modifyYTiframeseektime('1276')">0:21:16</a> reality whatsoever okay  
<a onclick="modifyYTiframeseektime('1279')">0:21:19</a> he says  
<a onclick="modifyYTiframeseektime('1283')">0:21:23</a> it's not lawful for you to oppress  
<a onclick="modifyYTiframeseektime('1287')">0:21:27</a> any individual even if the guy's a cafe  
<a onclick="modifyYTiframeseektime('1290')">0:21:30</a> and then he  
<a onclick="modifyYTiframeseektime('1291')">0:21:31</a> mentioned the statement of allah  
<a onclick="modifyYTiframeseektime('1292')">0:21:32</a> azzawajal

<a onclick="modifyYTiframeseektime('1356')">0:22:36</a> was a bit of that kind so let me just  
<a onclick="modifyYTiframeseektime('1358')">0:22:38</a> quickly mention exactly of what kind  
<a onclick="modifyYTiframeseektime('1360')">0:22:40</a> um it was it wasn't it wasn't it was it  
<a onclick="modifyYTiframeseektime('1362')">0:22:42</a> wasn't fair at all  
<a onclick="modifyYTiframeseektime('1363')">0:22:43</a> it was it was it was totally unjust so  
<a onclick="modifyYTiframeseektime('1367')">0:22:47</a> as i'm coming up to the two years it's  
<a onclick="modifyYTiframeseektime('1368')">0:22:48</a> really bothering me now right  
<a onclick="modifyYTiframeseektime('1370')">0:22:50</a> why did you before you continue with  
<a onclick="modifyYTiframeseektime('1371')">0:22:51</a> that sorry what made you come to that  
<a onclick="modifyYTiframeseektime('1373')">0:22:53</a> conclusion now  
<a onclick="modifyYTiframeseektime('1374')">0:22:54</a> i mean what was the thing because  
<a onclick="modifyYTiframeseektime('1378')">0:22:58</a> so from what i understand so far in the  
<a onclick="modifyYTiframeseektime('1380')">0:23:00</a> picture you  
<a onclick="modifyYTiframeseektime('1381')">0:23:01</a> didn't endorse it in the today beginning  
<a onclick="modifyYTiframeseektime('1383')">0:23:03</a> but then you  
<a onclick="modifyYTiframeseektime('1384')">0:23:04</a> kind of looked into it and thought  
<a onclick="modifyYTiframeseektime('1386')">0:23:06</a> actually this seems like a cut and paste  
<a onclick="modifyYTiframeseektime('1388')">0:23:08</a> job maybe or it's being meshed together  
<a onclick="modifyYTiframeseektime('1390')">0:23:10</a> in a way which is not  
<a onclick="modifyYTiframeseektime('1391')">0:23:11</a> favorable makes it look uh something  
<a onclick="modifyYTiframeseektime('1395')">0:23:15</a> that it's not so um  
<a onclick="modifyYTiframeseektime('1399')">0:23:19</a> what exactly about it do you think is  
<a onclick="modifyYTiframeseektime('1401')">0:23:21</a> unfair about it  
<a onclick="modifyYTiframeseektime('1402')">0:23:22</a> okay i'm gonna come on to that so so now  
<a onclick="modifyYTiframeseektime('1404')">0:23:24</a> the last two years  
<a onclick="modifyYTiframeseektime('1405')">0:23:25</a> every now and again i think about it i  
<a onclick="modifyYTiframeseektime('1407')">0:23:27</a> ask allah azzawajal to help me deal with  
<a onclick="modifyYTiframeseektime('1409')">0:23:29</a> this issue  
<a onclick="modifyYTiframeseektime('1410')">0:23:30</a> in the best and most correct way right  
<a onclick="modifyYTiframeseektime('1415')">0:23:35</a> praying is tahara i've even went to the  
<a onclick="modifyYTiframeseektime('1417')">0:23:37</a> kaaba okay  
<a onclick="modifyYTiframeseektime('1419')">0:23:39</a> and then one year before that i dropped  
<a onclick="modifyYTiframeseektime('1421')">0:23:41</a> a message to dr haytham  
<a onclick="modifyYTiframeseektime('1423')">0:23:43</a> on his whatsapp i got the number and i  
<a onclick="modifyYTiframeseektime('1425')">0:23:45</a> dropped a message to him  
<a onclick="modifyYTiframeseektime('1427')">0:23:47</a> about the issue of tibet  
<a onclick="modifyYTiframeseektime('1432')">0:23:52</a> right i never did that just because  
<a onclick="modifyYTiframeseektime('1436')">0:23:56</a> a friend of mine okay  
<a onclick="modifyYTiframeseektime('1439')">0:23:59</a> if your associates they do something  
<a onclick="modifyYTiframeseektime('1441')">0:24:01</a> it's not fair again  
<a onclick="modifyYTiframeseektime('1442')">0:24:02</a> for you to be painted with the same  
<a onclick="modifyYTiframeseektime('1444')">0:24:04</a> brush i just wanted to claim myself with  
<a onclick="modifyYTiframeseektime('1446')">0:24:06</a> him  
<a onclick="modifyYTiframeseektime('1446')">0:24:06</a> and i clearly and explicitly said to the  
<a onclick="modifyYTiframeseektime('1449')">0:24:09</a> i do not agree  
<a onclick="modifyYTiframeseektime('1450')">0:24:10</a> with the stances that you take and the  
<a onclick="modifyYTiframeseektime('1452')">0:24:12</a> views that you have and i'm not going to  
<a onclick="modifyYTiframeseektime('1453')">0:24:13</a> go into the other things that  
<a onclick="modifyYTiframeseektime('1455')">0:24:15</a> we discussed then because it's not right  
<a onclick="modifyYTiframeseektime('1458')">0:24:18</a> um i discussed this right now right  
<a onclick="modifyYTiframeseektime('1461')">0:24:21</a> um i said i had no i do not agree with  
<a onclick="modifyYTiframeseektime('1465')">0:24:25</a> you but i did not say that  
<a onclick="modifyYTiframeseektime('1467')">0:24:27</a> okay if abdulrahman's done today on you  
<a onclick="modifyYTiframeseektime('1469')">0:24:29</a> i've got nothing to do with that  
<a onclick="modifyYTiframeseektime('1471')">0:24:31</a> you see what i'm saying do you know  
<a onclick="modifyYTiframeseektime('1473')">0:24:33</a> anyone else other than  
<a onclick="modifyYTiframeseektime('1474')">0:24:34</a> in the in the group of the rahman hassan  
<a onclick="modifyYTiframeseektime('1477')">0:24:37</a> that  
<a onclick="modifyYTiframeseektime('1477')">0:24:37</a> did that pronounce that ruling on him  
<a onclick="modifyYTiframeseektime('1480')">0:24:40</a> that called him an innovation uh let's  
<a onclick="modifyYTiframeseektime('1483')">0:24:43</a> be more specific maybe calling the  
<a onclick="modifyYTiframeseektime('1485')">0:24:45</a> khawani  
<a onclick="modifyYTiframeseektime('1485')">0:24:45</a> right so you have to understand that but  
<a onclick="modifyYTiframeseektime('1488')">0:24:48</a> is it it's anonymous for them for  
<a onclick="modifyYTiframeseektime('1490')">0:24:50</a> like for example and he considers that  
<a onclick="modifyYTiframeseektime('1494')">0:24:54</a> deviant sect and so therefore so this is  
<a onclick="modifyYTiframeseektime('1497')">0:24:57</a> synonymous  
<a onclick="modifyYTiframeseektime('1498')">0:24:58</a> the same thing yeah and i mean like just  
<a onclick="modifyYTiframeseektime('1500')">0:25:00</a> so we're clear exactly what we're saying  
<a onclick="modifyYTiframeseektime('1502')">0:25:02</a> in it you know  
<a onclick="modifyYTiframeseektime('1503')">0:25:03</a> but uh if you call somebody that's  
<a onclick="modifyYTiframeseektime('1506')">0:25:06</a> you've declared that individual to be an  
<a onclick="modifyYTiframeseektime('1507')">0:25:07</a> innovator if you depend  
<a onclick="modifyYTiframeseektime('1508')">0:25:08</a> if you think that yeah  
<a onclick="modifyYTiframeseektime('1526')">0:25:26</a> many people say that you know  
<a onclick="modifyYTiframeseektime('1530')">0:25:30</a> they're not they're not really a sect in  
<a onclick="modifyYTiframeseektime('1531')">0:25:31</a> that sense the islamic  
<a onclick="modifyYTiframeseektime('1533')">0:25:33</a> definition of a sect the thing is if  
<a onclick="modifyYTiframeseektime('1535')">0:25:35</a> we're going to say ich ma  
<a onclick="modifyYTiframeseektime('1536')">0:25:36</a> i would have to know what every single  
<a onclick="modifyYTiframeseektime('1538')">0:25:38</a> scholar said no i don't think i've done  
<a onclick="modifyYTiframeseektime('1540')">0:25:40</a> it  
<a onclick="modifyYTiframeseektime('1540')">0:25:40</a> like i haven't collected every single  
<a onclick="modifyYTiframeseektime('1542')">0:25:42</a> scholar because  
<a onclick="modifyYTiframeseektime('1543')">0:25:43</a> means that every scholar in that time  
<a onclick="modifyYTiframeseektime('1547')">0:25:47</a> he has to agree and take a position of a  
<a onclick="modifyYTiframeseektime('1548')">0:25:48</a> certain yeah even even  
<a onclick="modifyYTiframeseektime('1550')">0:25:50</a> even more problematic i was reading  
<a onclick="modifyYTiframeseektime('1552')">0:25:52</a> sorry to cut you off  
<a onclick="modifyYTiframeseektime('1553')">0:25:53</a> this might be a tangent but i was  
<a onclick="modifyYTiframeseektime('1555')">0:25:55</a> reading sunnah okay and  
<a onclick="modifyYTiframeseektime('1556')">0:25:56</a> uh i was talking about who's included in  
<a onclick="modifyYTiframeseektime('1559')">0:25:59</a> ishmael  
<a onclick="modifyYTiframeseektime('1560')">0:26:00</a> and what makes it more difficult is that  
<a onclick="modifyYTiframeseektime('1562')">0:26:02</a> he actually includes the martezi lander  
<a onclick="modifyYTiframeseektime('1565')">0:26:05</a> you know it's gonna be difficult to get  
<a onclick="modifyYTiframeseektime('1566')">0:26:06</a> his mouth okay it's not a condition in  
<a onclick="modifyYTiframeseektime('1568')">0:26:08</a> order for  
<a onclick="modifyYTiframeseektime('1569')">0:26:09</a> a group to be misguided you don't always  
<a onclick="modifyYTiframeseektime('1571')">0:26:11</a> what you call an identity for everything  
<a onclick="modifyYTiframeseektime('1574')">0:26:14</a> in order for help them to take place  
<a onclick="modifyYTiframeseektime('1575')">0:26:15</a> right like nothing but the force we move  
<a onclick="modifyYTiframeseektime('1577')">0:26:17</a> them for  
<a onclick="modifyYTiframeseektime('1579')">0:26:19</a> not even muslims i'm just speaking about  
<a onclick="modifyYTiframeseektime('1580')">0:26:20</a> if we clearly established that  
<a onclick="modifyYTiframeseektime('1582')">0:26:22</a> this sect sector's totally misguided do  
<a onclick="modifyYTiframeseektime('1585')">0:26:25</a> i really need an ijmat before and hukum  
<a onclick="modifyYTiframeseektime('1587')">0:26:27</a> can be made by a scholar  
<a onclick="modifyYTiframeseektime('1589')">0:26:29</a> possibly not really okay before it  
<a onclick="modifyYTiframeseektime('1591')">0:26:31</a> removes them  
<a onclick="modifyYTiframeseektime('1592')">0:26:32</a> now i'm not talking about i'm going to  
<a onclick="modifyYTiframeseektime('1593')">0:26:33</a> impose this on you and you have to take  
<a onclick="modifyYTiframeseektime('1595')">0:26:35</a> this  
<a onclick="modifyYTiframeseektime('1596')">0:26:36</a> i'm not basically saying that you have  
<a onclick="modifyYTiframeseektime('1597')">0:26:37</a> to take my view or that yeah that's the  
<a onclick="modifyYTiframeseektime('1599')">0:26:39</a> view  
<a onclick="modifyYTiframeseektime('1599')">0:26:39</a> if the sheikh says and there's even  
<a onclick="modifyYTiframeseektime('1601')">0:26:41</a> maybe even if there's one person with  
<a onclick="modifyYTiframeseektime('1603')">0:26:43</a> him or even it is  
<a onclick="modifyYTiframeseektime('1604')">0:26:44</a> no one ever to be a delete you know what  
<a onclick="modifyYTiframeseektime('1607')">0:26:47</a> really matters is  
<a onclick="modifyYTiframeseektime('1608')">0:26:48</a> the evidences that are being brought  
<a onclick="modifyYTiframeseektime('1609')">0:26:49</a> forward right but i can't enforce  
<a onclick="modifyYTiframeseektime('1612')">0:26:52</a> it upon you to say yeah you have to take  
<a onclick="modifyYTiframeseektime('1613')">0:26:53</a> this and if you don't take that  
<a onclick="modifyYTiframeseektime('1615')">0:26:55</a> you're an innovator agreed well yeah  
<a onclick="modifyYTiframeseektime('1619')">0:26:59</a> yeah yeah this is uh it's unacceptable  
<a onclick="modifyYTiframeseektime('1623')">0:27:03</a> yeah  
<a onclick="modifyYTiframeseektime('1624')">0:27:04</a> what i was gonna say was that at this  
<a onclick="modifyYTiframeseektime('1625')">0:27:05</a> point of going back to it's clear like  
<a onclick="modifyYTiframeseektime('1627')">0:27:07</a> let's be honest that they considered him  
<a onclick="modifyYTiframeseektime('1629')">0:27:09</a> an innovator someone who's not sunny  
<a onclick="modifyYTiframeseektime('1631')">0:27:11</a> he said that in the park yeah about that  
<a onclick="modifyYTiframeseektime('1632')">0:27:12</a> one he came in they said that yeah i  
<a onclick="modifyYTiframeseektime('1633')">0:27:13</a> don't believe  
<a onclick="modifyYTiframeseektime('1635')">0:27:15</a> blah blah blah he made that kind of  
<a onclick="modifyYTiframeseektime('1637')">0:27:17</a> articulation so  
<a onclick="modifyYTiframeseektime('1639')">0:27:19</a> you're saying you don't have anything to  
<a onclick="modifyYTiframeseektime('1640')">0:27:20</a> do with that  
<a onclick="modifyYTiframeseektime('1643')">0:27:23</a> there is a difference between declaring  
<a onclick="modifyYTiframeseektime('1645')">0:27:25</a> somebody an innovator right  
<a onclick="modifyYTiframeseektime('1646')">0:27:26</a> and one having fallen into innovation  
<a onclick="modifyYTiframeseektime('1648')">0:27:28</a> that's why he says  
<a onclick="modifyYTiframeseektime('1661')">0:27:41</a> yeah and uh and not everybody that falls  
<a onclick="modifyYTiframeseektime('1663')">0:27:43</a> into a bidder can you call him a move  
<a onclick="modifyYTiframeseektime('1665')">0:27:45</a> teddy  
<a onclick="modifyYTiframeseektime('1665')">0:27:45</a> okay that's we need to really just  
<a onclick="modifyYTiframeseektime('1667')">0:27:47</a> differentiate between the two  
<a onclick="modifyYTiframeseektime('1669')">0:27:49</a> okay i might say okay this person has  
<a onclick="modifyYTiframeseektime('1673')">0:27:53</a> these uh bid acts with him these  
<a onclick="modifyYTiframeseektime('1675')">0:27:55</a> innovations with him  
<a onclick="modifyYTiframeseektime('1676')">0:27:56</a> that doesn't mean that i'm calling him  
<a onclick="modifyYTiframeseektime('1678')">0:27:58</a> an innovator tadia is something huge  
<a onclick="modifyYTiframeseektime('1680')">0:28:00</a> right okay um uh  
<a onclick="modifyYTiframeseektime('1684')">0:28:04</a> this is not a light matter so you're  
<a onclick="modifyYTiframeseektime('1686')">0:28:06</a> saying  
<a onclick="modifyYTiframeseektime('1694')">0:28:14</a> so for you now you have to understand  
<a onclick="modifyYTiframeseektime('1696')">0:28:16</a> like these kind of things are normally  
<a onclick="modifyYTiframeseektime('1698')">0:28:18</a> done in a court case yeah  
<a onclick="modifyYTiframeseektime('1700')">0:28:20</a> and you get how to account for you know  
<a onclick="modifyYTiframeseektime('1702')">0:28:22</a> compensations go out because of what you  
<a onclick="modifyYTiframeseektime('1704')">0:28:24</a> say actually about a person  
<a onclick="modifyYTiframeseektime('1706')">0:28:26</a> when it comes to taking him out keeping  
<a onclick="modifyYTiframeseektime('1708')">0:28:28</a> him in right do you think that  
<a onclick="modifyYTiframeseektime('1710')">0:28:30</a> so therefore do you think do you think  
<a onclick="modifyYTiframeseektime('1712')">0:28:32</a> that that that was a mistake  
<a onclick="modifyYTiframeseektime('1714')">0:28:34</a> well then we have to make that kind of  
<a onclick="modifyYTiframeseektime('1715')">0:28:35</a> this no i'm saying this is an issue that  
<a onclick="modifyYTiframeseektime('1719')">0:28:39</a> none of us should be speaking about okay  
<a onclick="modifyYTiframeseektime('1720')">0:28:40</a> it's an issue that needs to be taken to  
<a onclick="modifyYTiframeseektime('1722')">0:28:42</a> the scholars  
<a onclick="modifyYTiframeseektime('1731')">0:28:51</a> these are big affairs that doesn't go  
<a onclick="modifyYTiframeseektime('1732')">0:28:52</a> back to myself  
<a onclick="modifyYTiframeseektime('1734')">0:28:54</a> yourself these students of knowledge who  
<a onclick="modifyYTiframeseektime('1737')">0:28:57</a> are in the uk  
<a onclick="modifyYTiframeseektime('1738')">0:28:58</a> even in the west this is an issue leave  
<a onclick="modifyYTiframeseektime('1740')">0:29:00</a> it to the scholars this is their job  
<a onclick="modifyYTiframeseektime('1742')">0:29:02</a> okay you see what i'm saying yeah so um  
<a onclick="modifyYTiframeseektime('1745')">0:29:05</a> that's what  
<a onclick="modifyYTiframeseektime('1745')">0:29:05</a> that's what should have happened that's

<a onclick="modifyYTiframeseektime('1881')">0:31:21</a> and then they said that he was going to  
<a onclick="modifyYTiframeseektime('1882')">0:31:22</a> unite with them

<a onclick="modifyYTiframeseektime('1942')">0:32:22</a> there was many times that i justified it  
<a onclick="modifyYTiframeseektime('1944')">0:32:24</a> now right  
<a onclick="modifyYTiframeseektime('1945')">0:32:25</a> and so many how many people watched that

<a onclick="modifyYTiframeseektime('1958')">0:32:38</a> no but but now you're saying that that  
<a onclick="modifyYTiframeseektime('1960')">0:32:40</a> was right practically  
<a onclick="modifyYTiframeseektime('1962')">0:32:42</a> but he he dis we're going to come into  
<a onclick="modifyYTiframeseektime('1964')">0:32:44</a> that promise we're going to come and do

<a onclick="modifyYTiframeseektime('1971')">0:32:51</a> to clarify this publicly  
<a onclick="modifyYTiframeseektime('1972')">0:32:52</a> yeah because even azimuth  
<a onclick="modifyYTiframeseektime('1976')">0:32:56</a> mentions that whatever is done privately

<a onclick="modifyYTiframeseektime('1987')">0:33:07</a> right because i did it publicly now i  
<a onclick="modifyYTiframeseektime('1990')">0:33:10</a> have to at least make sure that to the  
<a onclick="modifyYTiframeseektime('1991')">0:33:11</a> best of my ability i can get that  
<a onclick="modifyYTiframeseektime('1992')">0:33:12</a> message across to all these people  
<a onclick="modifyYTiframeseektime('1994')">0:33:14</a> who may have taken out from that video  
<a onclick="modifyYTiframeseektime('1997')">0:33:17</a> that what i was saying was correct  
<a onclick="modifyYTiframeseektime('1999')">0:33:19</a> if i come to the conclusion of this so  
<a onclick="modifyYTiframeseektime('2001')">0:33:21</a> are you saying because you've quoted the  
<a onclick="modifyYTiframeseektime('2002')">0:33:22</a> verse  
<a onclick="modifyYTiframeseektime('2008')">0:33:28</a> are you are you making are making

<a onclick="modifyYTiframeseektime('2034')">0:33:54</a> and obviously at that time all these  
<a onclick="modifyYTiframeseektime('2036')">0:33:56</a> ayats are going through your head  
<a onclick="modifyYTiframeseektime('2037')">0:33:57</a> you know your friends yo me affirmative  
<a onclick="modifyYTiframeseektime('2040')">0:34:00</a> because at the end

<a onclick="modifyYTiframeseektime('2047')">0:34:07</a> i'm saying as allah mentions  
<a onclick="modifyYTiframeseektime('2051')">0:34:11</a> every person is going to come by himself  
<a onclick="modifyYTiframeseektime('2053')">0:34:13</a> and the day when the brother is going to  
<a onclick="modifyYTiframeseektime('2055')">0:34:15</a> run away from his brother and  
<a onclick="modifyYTiframeseektime('2056')">0:34:16</a> mother and so on and so forth right and

<a onclick="modifyYTiframeseektime('2062')">0:34:22</a> the past and they loved for me to defend  
<a onclick="modifyYTiframeseektime('2065')">0:34:25</a> them  
<a onclick="modifyYTiframeseektime('2067')">0:34:27</a> um it's important that someone else  
<a onclick="modifyYTiframeseektime('2070')">0:34:30</a> should get that as all you see what i'm  
<a onclick="modifyYTiframeseektime('2072')">0:34:32</a> saying just like as you love to be  
<a onclick="modifyYTiframeseektime('2073')">0:34:33</a> defended

<a onclick="modifyYTiframeseektime('2077')">0:34:37</a> the defense is against you know  
<a onclick="modifyYTiframeseektime('2080')">0:34:40</a> so aki for the last month or like the  
<a onclick="modifyYTiframeseektime('2082')">0:34:42</a> last month  
<a onclick="modifyYTiframeseektime('2083')">0:34:43</a> because i have a little studio in my  
<a onclick="modifyYTiframeseektime('2084')">0:34:44</a> flat and i was like i just i've been  
<a onclick="modifyYTiframeseektime('2086')">0:34:46</a> thinking about how can i would you call

<a onclick="modifyYTiframeseektime('2089')">0:34:49</a> um really just get this out how can i  
<a onclick="modifyYTiframeseektime('2091')">0:34:51</a> deal with it  
<a onclick="modifyYTiframeseektime('2093')">0:34:53</a> and uh and then that these two videos  
<a onclick="modifyYTiframeseektime('2095')">0:34:55</a> came out  
<a onclick="modifyYTiframeseektime('2097')">0:34:57</a> and it's just subhanallah and it just  
<a onclick="modifyYTiframeseektime('2100')">0:35:00</a> happened to happen you know  
<a onclick="modifyYTiframeseektime('2103')">0:35:03</a> um so yeah so where are we at the moment  
<a onclick="modifyYTiframeseektime('2106')">0:35:06</a> so yes  
<a onclick="modifyYTiframeseektime('2107')">0:35:07</a> so you're at the point where i was  
<a onclick="modifyYTiframeseektime('2108')">0:35:08</a> talking about you watched the video  
<a onclick="modifyYTiframeseektime('2110')">0:35:10</a> seven eight times  
<a onclick="modifyYTiframeseektime('2111')">0:35:11</a> and you came to a conclusion that you  
<a onclick="modifyYTiframeseektime('2113')">0:35:13</a> that was  
<a onclick="modifyYTiframeseektime('2114')">0:35:14</a> to be associated with that and to defend  
<a onclick="modifyYTiframeseektime('2116')">0:35:16</a> that position yeah  
<a onclick="modifyYTiframeseektime('2118')">0:35:18</a> um because like i said you know with  
<a onclick="modifyYTiframeseektime('2119')">0:35:19</a> adam rashid yeah that discussion with  
<a onclick="modifyYTiframeseektime('2121')">0:35:21</a> him that discussion that  
<a onclick="modifyYTiframeseektime('2123')">0:35:23</a> uh i had with adnan rashid i stood by  
<a onclick="modifyYTiframeseektime('2126')">0:35:26</a> that position and i even said that this  
<a onclick="modifyYTiframeseektime('2128')">0:35:28</a> has caused confusion and everything of  
<a onclick="modifyYTiframeseektime('2129')">0:35:29</a> what he was doing  
<a onclick="modifyYTiframeseektime('2131')">0:35:31</a> and i've heard some of the arguments as  
<a onclick="modifyYTiframeseektime('2132')">0:35:32</a> well that the brothers bring that he  
<a onclick="modifyYTiframeseektime('2134')">0:35:34</a> woke up that day

<a onclick="modifyYTiframeseektime('2138')">0:35:38</a> is what the whole  
<a onclick="modifyYTiframeseektime('2140')">0:35:40</a> the whole conversation was about when i  
<a onclick="modifyYTiframeseektime('2143')">0:35:43</a> went back to the video  
<a onclick="modifyYTiframeseektime('2144')">0:35:44</a> the fact that as soon as they let him

<a onclick="modifyYTiframeseektime('2148')">0:35:48</a> his blasting what's in their books and

<a onclick="modifyYTiframeseektime('2164')">0:36:04</a> cure the  
<a onclick="modifyYTiframeseektime('2165')">0:36:05</a> because everything runs on it goes dual  
<a onclick="modifyYTiframeseektime('2168')">0:36:08</a> you know countries are built on  
<a onclick="modifyYTiframeseektime('2171')">0:36:11</a> and um and i heard some of the arguments  
<a onclick="modifyYTiframeseektime('2174')">0:36:14</a> that the brothers mentioned as all that  
<a onclick="modifyYTiframeseektime('2176')">0:36:16</a> um okay babe what are they gonna leave

<a onclick="modifyYTiframeseektime('2308')">0:38:28</a> point he can't answer to some of the  
<a onclick="modifyYTiframeseektime('2310')">0:38:30</a> ayah the verses you're saying that the  
<a onclick="modifyYTiframeseektime('2311')">0:38:31</a> religion is barbaric and

<a onclick="modifyYTiframeseektime('2327')">0:38:47</a> him like that john fontaine said some  
<a onclick="modifyYTiframeseektime('2328')">0:38:48</a> good things about him that they've  
<a onclick="modifyYTiframeseektime('2329')">0:38:49</a> traveled together  
<a onclick="modifyYTiframeseektime('2331')">0:38:51</a> and um i the only time that i know i've  
<a onclick="modifyYTiframeseektime('2334')">0:38:54</a> done rasheed is  
<a onclick="modifyYTiframeseektime('2335')">0:38:55</a> from the debate from the debate that  
<a onclick="modifyYTiframeseektime('2339')">0:38:59</a> abdullah hassan when he was debating on  
<a onclick="modifyYTiframeseektime('2340')">0:39:00</a> sarasota i was sitting there right  
<a onclick="modifyYTiframeseektime('2343')">0:39:03</a> adnan rasheed is messaging me in a very  
<a onclick="modifyYTiframeseektime('2346')">0:39:06</a> very respectful way okay  
<a onclick="modifyYTiframeseektime('2349')">0:39:09</a> i know that i'm not his sheikh no i know  
<a onclick="modifyYTiframeseektime('2354')">0:39:14</a> so but the point is he's being very  
<a onclick="modifyYTiframeseektime('2355')">0:39:15</a> respectful yeah that's yeah that's how  
<a onclick="modifyYTiframeseektime('2357')">0:39:17</a> he is  
<a onclick="modifyYTiframeseektime('2357')">0:39:17</a> yeah so uh that's the only thing that  
<a onclick="modifyYTiframeseektime('2360')">0:39:20</a> i've ever known of him  
<a onclick="modifyYTiframeseektime('2361')">0:39:21</a> so he's saying make sure you say this  
<a onclick="modifyYTiframeseektime('2363')">0:39:23</a> make sure this gets to him  
<a onclick="modifyYTiframeseektime('2365')">0:39:25</a> i've never seen him from then so all my  
<a onclick="modifyYTiframeseektime('2367')">0:39:27</a> relationship with him is a very  
<a onclick="modifyYTiframeseektime('2368')">0:39:28</a> respectful relationship  
<a onclick="modifyYTiframeseektime('2369')">0:39:29</a> he does he does that with with people  
<a onclick="modifyYTiframeseektime('2374')">0:39:34</a> yeah and that's a very respectful way to  
<a onclick="modifyYTiframeseektime('2376')">0:39:36</a> speak to someone even  
<a onclick="modifyYTiframeseektime('2378')">0:39:38</a> yeah of course i've never told him  
<a onclick="modifyYTiframeseektime('2379')">0:39:39</a> anything like he's older than me and  
<a onclick="modifyYTiframeseektime('2381')">0:39:41</a> everything right so the point in all of  
<a onclick="modifyYTiframeseektime('2382')">0:39:42</a> this is  
<a onclick="modifyYTiframeseektime('2383')">0:39:43</a> you're speaking in a very respectful way  
<a onclick="modifyYTiframeseektime('2385')">0:39:45</a> that's all i've ever known of you  
<a onclick="modifyYTiframeseektime('2387')">0:39:47</a> you call me to the park like and i can  
<a onclick="modifyYTiframeseektime('2390')">0:39:50</a> see him he's very  
<a onclick="modifyYTiframeseektime('2391')">0:39:51</a> very angry very upset  
<a onclick="modifyYTiframeseektime('2395')">0:39:55</a> and uh i don't understand why he's upset  
<a onclick="modifyYTiframeseektime('2397')">0:39:57</a> why he's screwing  
<a onclick="modifyYTiframeseektime('2398')">0:39:58</a> until we actually start the discussion  
<a onclick="modifyYTiframeseektime('2400')">0:40:00</a> be honest i don't watch the whole  
<a onclick="modifyYTiframeseektime('2401')">0:40:01</a> discussion  
<a onclick="modifyYTiframeseektime('2402')">0:40:02</a> so i thought i watched bits of it like  
<a onclick="modifyYTiframeseektime('2405')">0:40:05</a> highlights and stuff  
<a onclick="modifyYTiframeseektime('2406')">0:40:06</a> but the gist of it from what i  
<a onclick="modifyYTiframeseektime('2408')">0:40:08</a> understand is that basically  
<a onclick="modifyYTiframeseektime('2410')">0:40:10</a> like you said you were you were  
<a onclick="modifyYTiframeseektime('2411')">0:40:11</a> defending that position and he was not  
<a onclick="modifyYTiframeseektime('2413')">0:40:13</a> he was saying  
<a onclick="modifyYTiframeseektime('2414')">0:40:14</a> he was upset he was he was he was angry  
<a onclick="modifyYTiframeseektime('2416')">0:40:16</a> and yeah  
<a onclick="modifyYTiframeseektime('2418')">0:40:18</a> yeah no he wasn't even he was basically  
<a onclick="modifyYTiframeseektime('2420')">0:40:20</a> saying uh  
<a onclick="modifyYTiframeseektime('2421')">0:40:21</a> we we went from one topic to another  
<a onclick="modifyYTiframeseektime('2423')">0:40:23</a> topic and no  
<a onclick="modifyYTiframeseektime('2424')">0:40:24</a> no topics it wasn't like a healthy way  
<a onclick="modifyYTiframeseektime('2426')">0:40:26</a> of having a discussion  
<a onclick="modifyYTiframeseektime('2428')">0:40:28</a> okay that's why that's why even clearing  
<a onclick="modifyYTiframeseektime('2429')">0:40:29</a> the video i keep saying okay let's go  
<a onclick="modifyYTiframeseektime('2431')">0:40:31</a> sit there  
<a onclick="modifyYTiframeseektime('2432')">0:40:32</a> let's go outside see the guys angry and  
<a onclick="modifyYTiframeseektime('2433')">0:40:33</a> i miss a lot and what did he say  
<a onclick="modifyYTiframeseektime('2435')">0:40:35</a> if you're standing up and you're angry  
<a onclick="modifyYTiframeseektime('2436')">0:40:36</a> go and sit down if you're sitting down  
<a onclick="modifyYTiframeseektime('2438')">0:40:38</a> and go lie down right  
<a onclick="modifyYTiframeseektime('2440')">0:40:40</a> so um and okay i wasn't trying to  
<a onclick="modifyYTiframeseektime('2444')">0:40:44</a> disrespect him  
<a onclick="modifyYTiframeseektime('2445')">0:40:45</a> i wasn't being horrible towards him i  
<a onclick="modifyYTiframeseektime('2447')">0:40:47</a> can see why he's upset  
<a onclick="modifyYTiframeseektime('2449')">0:40:49</a> because how about this how about that  
<a onclick="modifyYTiframeseektime('2450')">0:40:50</a> we'll put all of that behind us yeah  
<a onclick="modifyYTiframeseektime('2453')">0:40:53</a> seriously muhammad i i i don't  
<a onclick="modifyYTiframeseektime('2457')">0:40:57</a> mean rasheed until that debate which was  
<a onclick="modifyYTiframeseektime('2460')">0:41:00</a> i think maybe like two weeks before  
<a onclick="modifyYTiframeseektime('2463')">0:41:03</a> or maybe like three weeks before our  
<a onclick="modifyYTiframeseektime('2465')">0:41:05</a> discussion in hyde park right i wouldn't  
<a onclick="modifyYTiframeseektime('2467')">0:41:07</a> even call it even  
<a onclick="modifyYTiframeseektime('2467')">0:41:07</a> never huh it was just i wasn't that  
<a onclick="modifyYTiframeseektime('2469')">0:41:09</a> wasn't that was an argument  
<a onclick="modifyYTiframeseektime('2471')">0:41:11</a> it was just an argument and and um  
<a onclick="modifyYTiframeseektime('2474')">0:41:14</a> yeah and you know like what i would put  
<a onclick="modifyYTiframeseektime('2476')">0:41:16</a> to you now on this on this issue around  
<a onclick="modifyYTiframeseektime('2478')">0:41:18</a> the russians  
<a onclick="modifyYTiframeseektime('2479')">0:41:19</a> it seems like you and him are on the  
<a onclick="modifyYTiframeseektime('2480')">0:41:20</a> same page in a sense that you don't you  
<a onclick="modifyYTiframeseektime('2481')">0:41:21</a> both believe in the same  
<a onclick="modifyYTiframeseektime('2483')">0:41:23</a> things and like you're agreeing that  
<a onclick="modifyYTiframeseektime('2486')">0:41:26</a> you know that [ __ ] that video shouldn't  
<a onclick="modifyYTiframeseektime('2487')">0:41:27</a> be put out which i think was the main  
<a onclick="modifyYTiframeseektime('2490')">0:41:30</a> point though let me make this very  
<a onclick="modifyYTiframeseektime('2491')">0:41:31</a> crystally clear right i'm speaking about  
<a onclick="modifyYTiframeseektime('2493')">0:41:33</a> that point  
<a onclick="modifyYTiframeseektime('2494')">0:41:34</a> yeah of doctor hathan yeah yeah  
<a onclick="modifyYTiframeseektime('2497')">0:41:37</a> um i think he was basically just trying  
<a onclick="modifyYTiframeseektime('2500')">0:41:40</a> too hard  
<a onclick="modifyYTiframeseektime('2502')">0:41:42</a> yeah yeah and what what said about him  
<a onclick="modifyYTiframeseektime('2504')">0:41:44</a> like there's other things that if you  
<a onclick="modifyYTiframeseektime('2506')">0:41:46</a> wanted to refume that you could refute  
<a onclick="modifyYTiframeseektime('2507')">0:41:47</a> him on  
<a onclick="modifyYTiframeseektime('2508')">0:41:48</a> but at that point i believe he was wrong  
<a onclick="modifyYTiframeseektime('2510')">0:41:50</a> and you'd have to get someone on his  
<a onclick="modifyYTiframeseektime('2511')">0:41:51</a> level to be fair yeah  
<a onclick="modifyYTiframeseektime('2513')">0:41:53</a> that's yeah yeah otherwise it would just  
<a onclick="modifyYTiframeseektime('2515')">0:41:55</a> i mean from an end user perspective  
<a onclick="modifyYTiframeseektime('2517')">0:41:57</a> people would just  
<a onclick="modifyYTiframeseektime('2518')">0:41:58</a> like i mean i'm happy somewhere i want  
<a onclick="modifyYTiframeseektime('2520')">0:42:00</a> to see i want to hear i personally want  
<a onclick="modifyYTiframeseektime('2521')">0:42:01</a> to hear  
<a onclick="modifyYTiframeseektime('2522')">0:42:02</a> a second opinion on the student loan  
<a onclick="modifyYTiframeseektime('2523')">0:42:03</a> issue or no no  
<a onclick="modifyYTiframeseektime('2525')">0:42:05</a> no no the student loan yeah or the

<a onclick="modifyYTiframeseektime('2530')">0:42:10</a> controversial yeah but it's got to be  
<a onclick="modifyYTiframeseektime('2532')">0:42:12</a> someone  
<a onclick="modifyYTiframeseektime('2532')">0:42:12</a> you know because even if say for example  
<a onclick="modifyYTiframeseektime('2534')">0:42:14</a> let's let's let's say that people have  
<a onclick="modifyYTiframeseektime('2536')">0:42:16</a> the knowledge

<a onclick="modifyYTiframeseektime('2538')">0:42:18</a> just agree it's just not going to be  
<a onclick="modifyYTiframeseektime('2540')">0:42:20</a> taken seriously from the end user  
<a onclick="modifyYTiframeseektime('2542')">0:42:22</a> so if someone's on his level right and

<a onclick="modifyYTiframeseektime('2597')">0:43:17</a> or they have it on a very superficial  
<a onclick="modifyYTiframeseektime('2598')">0:43:18</a> level and then you go out and attack  
<a onclick="modifyYTiframeseektime('2600')">0:43:20</a> that or something  
<a onclick="modifyYTiframeseektime('2604')">0:43:24</a> yeah or he's got much more controversial  
<a onclick="modifyYTiframeseektime('2605')">0:43:25</a> opinions or  
<a onclick="modifyYTiframeseektime('2607')">0:43:27</a> hamsa youssef who's got some  
<a onclick="modifyYTiframeseektime('2609')">0:43:29</a> controversial opinions especially

<a onclick="modifyYTiframeseektime('2614')">0:43:34</a> and the reason why is just because the  
<a onclick="modifyYTiframeseektime('2616')">0:43:36</a> guy's age the guy's credentials the guys  
<a onclick="modifyYTiframeseektime('2618')">0:43:38</a> uh he's been in the game longer than you  
<a onclick="modifyYTiframeseektime('2620')">0:43:40</a> have and it's just  
<a onclick="modifyYTiframeseektime('2622')">0:43:42</a> it's not like for like if that makes  
<a onclick="modifyYTiframeseektime('2624')">0:43:44</a> sense it's not like for like  
<a onclick="modifyYTiframeseektime('2625')">0:43:45</a> so um that's what we especially on  
<a onclick="modifyYTiframeseektime('2629')">0:43:49</a> matters where  
<a onclick="modifyYTiframeseektime('2629')">0:43:49</a> you need you need more than more than  
<a onclick="modifyYTiframeseektime('2632')">0:43:52</a> superficial knowledge  
<a onclick="modifyYTiframeseektime('2633')">0:43:53</a> i i think that's my just my view on it i  
<a onclick="modifyYTiframeseektime('2636')">0:43:56</a> might be wrong  
<a onclick="modifyYTiframeseektime('2637')">0:43:57</a> but i think a lot of people from from  
<a onclick="modifyYTiframeseektime('2639')">0:43:59</a> the feedback i've been getting is  
<a onclick="modifyYTiframeseektime('2640')">0:44:00</a> they would kind of look in that  
<a onclick="modifyYTiframeseektime('2642')">0:44:02</a> direction you know i mean someone who's  
<a onclick="modifyYTiframeseektime('2644')">0:44:04</a> a bit older someone is  
<a onclick="modifyYTiframeseektime('2645')">0:44:05</a> and is not personally or emotionally  
<a onclick="modifyYTiframeseektime('2646')">0:44:06</a> invested in the issue but look  
<a onclick="modifyYTiframeseektime('2648')">0:44:08</a> let's focus on the positives here i  
<a onclick="modifyYTiframeseektime('2650')">0:44:10</a> think that there's the positives in this  
<a onclick="modifyYTiframeseektime('2651')">0:44:11</a> situation is that  
<a onclick="modifyYTiframeseektime('2653')">0:44:13</a> that people are coming towards the same  
<a onclick="modifyYTiframeseektime('2654')">0:44:14</a> kind of understanding look  
<a onclick="modifyYTiframeseektime('2656')">0:44:16</a> when it comes to subjective fear let's  
<a onclick="modifyYTiframeseektime('2658')">0:44:18</a> have a more nuanced approach  
<a onclick="modifyYTiframeseektime('2659')">0:44:19</a> otherwise i believe it's going to be  
<a onclick="modifyYTiframeseektime('2660')">0:44:20</a> chaos there will be chaos there it's  
<a onclick="modifyYTiframeseektime('2662')">0:44:22</a> going to just  
<a onclick="modifyYTiframeseektime('2662')">0:44:22</a> the issue is just you're going to find a  
<a onclick="modifyYTiframeseektime('2665')">0:44:25</a> bunch of individuals  
<a onclick="modifyYTiframeseektime('2666')">0:44:26</a> here yeah just coming out and speaking  
<a onclick="modifyYTiframeseektime('2668')">0:44:28</a> about these very big issues okay  
<a onclick="modifyYTiframeseektime('2670')">0:44:30</a> i can just leave it for whatever  
<a onclick="modifyYTiframeseektime('2672')">0:44:32</a> scholarship just let them do their thing  
<a onclick="modifyYTiframeseektime('2674')">0:44:34</a> yeah that kind of responsibility  
<a onclick="modifyYTiframeseektime('2678')">0:44:38</a> yeah yeah and alhamdulillah he hasn't  
<a onclick="modifyYTiframeseektime('2681')">0:44:41</a> because if he has then we would be in  
<a onclick="modifyYTiframeseektime('2682')">0:44:42</a> big trouble if we get things wrong  
<a onclick="modifyYTiframeseektime('2683')">0:44:43</a> yeah you know and so that's one thing so  
<a onclick="modifyYTiframeseektime('2686')">0:44:46</a> now you would say that  
<a onclick="modifyYTiframeseektime('2695')">0:44:55</a> yeah i don't think i've had anything in  
<a onclick="modifyYTiframeseektime('2696')">0:44:56</a> my heart towards him i just think the  
<a onclick="modifyYTiframeseektime('2698')">0:44:58</a> way  
<a onclick="modifyYTiframeseektime('2698')">0:44:58</a> you think about him shake his head yeah  
<a onclick="modifyYTiframeseektime('2701')">0:45:01</a> yeah absolutely  
<a onclick="modifyYTiframeseektime('2712')">0:45:12</a> he's a monster in his field the thing is  
<a onclick="modifyYTiframeseektime('2714')">0:45:14</a> i just haven't even like  
<a onclick="modifyYTiframeseektime('2716')">0:45:16</a> i don't personally watch videos that's

<a onclick="modifyYTiframeseektime('2720')">0:45:20</a> click on it but i'm just so  
<a onclick="modifyYTiframeseektime('2722')">0:45:22</a> kind of like on this point i don't know  
<a onclick="modifyYTiframeseektime('2724')">0:45:24</a> what she is  
<a onclick="modifyYTiframeseektime('2726')">0:45:26</a> one of the top debaters in the muslim  
<a onclick="modifyYTiframeseektime('2729')">0:45:29</a> world right now yeah

<a onclick="modifyYTiframeseektime('2733')">0:45:33</a> from and that's one of the biggest  
<a onclick="modifyYTiframeseektime('2735')">0:45:35</a> tragedies in these things  
<a onclick="modifyYTiframeseektime('2736')">0:45:36</a> both of you are working on different  
<a onclick="modifyYTiframeseektime('2737')">0:45:37</a> lines of knowledge like you know

<a onclick="modifyYTiframeseektime('2748')">0:45:48</a> because we don't necessarily focus on  
<a onclick="modifyYTiframeseektime('2750')">0:45:50</a> these issues  
<a onclick="modifyYTiframeseektime('2751')">0:45:51</a> but someone like on the other hand if

<a onclick="modifyYTiframeseektime('2962')">0:49:22</a> to take away from anyone else right  
<a onclick="modifyYTiframeseektime('2964')">0:49:24</a> no one's and you know like like  
<a onclick="modifyYTiframeseektime('2968')">0:49:28</a> i'm gonna maybe look into this right  
<a onclick="modifyYTiframeseektime('2969')">0:49:29</a> right now i know he has a youtube  
<a onclick="modifyYTiframeseektime('2971')">0:49:31</a> channel and everything  
<a onclick="modifyYTiframeseektime('2972')">0:49:32</a> yes i've kind of haven't followed him on  
<a onclick="modifyYTiframeseektime('2974')">0:49:34</a> what he knows  
<a onclick="modifyYTiframeseektime('2977')">0:49:37</a> i don't know much about it like i can't  
<a onclick="modifyYTiframeseektime('2979')">0:49:39</a> you know say anything bad about him yes  
<a onclick="modifyYTiframeseektime('2981')">0:49:41</a> with regards to that like the only uh  
<a onclick="modifyYTiframeseektime('2984')">0:49:44</a> one that i've kind of like really just  
<a onclick="modifyYTiframeseektime('2986')">0:49:46</a> spoken about to was john fontaine  
<a onclick="modifyYTiframeseektime('2988')">0:49:48</a> yes when we did the podcast and uh  
<a onclick="modifyYTiframeseektime('2991')">0:49:51</a> you know what john fontaine is good at  
<a onclick="modifyYTiframeseektime('2993')">0:49:53</a> right yeah  
<a onclick="modifyYTiframeseektime('2994')">0:49:54</a> let's not leave anyone else yeah and he  
<a onclick="modifyYTiframeseektime('2998')">0:49:58</a> said some good things about him i can't  
<a onclick="modifyYTiframeseektime('3000')">0:50:00</a> speak bad about a person if i don't know  
<a onclick="modifyYTiframeseektime('3001')">0:50:01</a> him no no i've been trying to see what  
<a onclick="modifyYTiframeseektime('3003')">0:50:03</a> i'm saying i know him  
<a onclick="modifyYTiframeseektime('3003')">0:50:03</a> yeah so i don't know much about him  
<a onclick="modifyYTiframeseektime('3008')">0:50:08</a> right yeah yeah  
<a onclick="modifyYTiframeseektime('3014')">0:50:14</a> when speaking about others it has to be  
<a onclick="modifyYTiframeseektime('3016')">0:50:16</a> of justice and knowledge not with  
<a onclick="modifyYTiframeseektime('3018')">0:50:18</a> ignorance  
<a onclick="modifyYTiframeseektime('3018')">0:50:18</a> and unfairness and injustice right right  
<a onclick="modifyYTiframeseektime('3021')">0:50:21</a> as this is the situation  
<a onclick="modifyYTiframeseektime('3022')">0:50:22</a> he says that the people of innovation  
<a onclick="modifyYTiframeseektime('3023')">0:50:23</a> speak like that exactly man exactly  
<a onclick="modifyYTiframeseektime('3026')">0:50:26</a> so now let's move on to another  
<a onclick="modifyYTiframeseektime('3027')">0:50:27</a> controversy which i've been involved in  
<a onclick="modifyYTiframeseektime('3029')">0:50:29</a> unfortunately and put my hand in and  
<a onclick="modifyYTiframeseektime('3032')">0:50:32</a> created my own sense of controversy is  
<a onclick="modifyYTiframeseektime('3034')">0:50:34</a> um you also  
<a onclick="modifyYTiframeseektime('3035')">0:50:35</a> had nothing to do as far as i know with  
<a onclick="modifyYTiframeseektime('3038')">0:50:38</a> the the leaking  
<a onclick="modifyYTiframeseektime('3039')">0:50:39</a> or of the emails and you want to make  
<a onclick="modifyYTiframeseektime('3042')">0:50:42</a> that clear as well don't you  
<a onclick="modifyYTiframeseektime('3045')">0:50:45</a> again first uh like i said earlier i'm  
<a onclick="modifyYTiframeseektime('3047')">0:50:47</a> putting making that video or you didn't  
<a onclick="modifyYTiframeseektime('3048')">0:50:48</a> endorse that did you  
<a onclick="modifyYTiframeseektime('3050')">0:50:50</a> look again i was not consulted  
<a onclick="modifyYTiframeseektime('3053')">0:50:53</a> beforehand  
<a onclick="modifyYTiframeseektime('3054')">0:50:54</a> right as i mentioned before as well i'll  
<a onclick="modifyYTiframeseektime('3056')">0:50:56</a> say explicitly now right  
<a onclick="modifyYTiframeseektime('3059')">0:50:59</a> i only knew about a video just maybe  
<a onclick="modifyYTiframeseektime('3061')">0:51:01</a> like a day or two before it was going  
<a onclick="modifyYTiframeseektime('3063')">0:51:03</a> out that a video was coming up  
<a onclick="modifyYTiframeseektime('3066')">0:51:06</a> i only ended up seeing the video after  
<a onclick="modifyYTiframeseektime('3068')">0:51:08</a> it was released just like everybody else  
<a onclick="modifyYTiframeseektime('3070')">0:51:10</a> right and i watched the video twice okay  
<a onclick="modifyYTiframeseektime('3073')">0:51:13</a> and at the time things are happening  
<a onclick="modifyYTiframeseektime('3075')">0:51:15</a> very very quickly very quickly right  
<a onclick="modifyYTiframeseektime('3078')">0:51:18</a> and uh with regards to leaking of the  
<a onclick="modifyYTiframeseektime('3080')">0:51:20</a> emails yes okay i  
<a onclick="modifyYTiframeseektime('3082')">0:51:22</a> had i didn't even know that was  
<a onclick="modifyYTiframeseektime('3084')">0:51:24</a> happening so another question i have  
<a onclick="modifyYTiframeseektime('3086')">0:51:26</a> here is  
<a onclick="modifyYTiframeseektime('3087')">0:51:27</a> did you have anything to do with leaking  
<a onclick="modifyYTiframeseektime('3089')">0:51:29</a> emails or publicizing the lead material  
<a onclick="modifyYTiframeseektime('3091')">0:51:31</a> okay like like i said before um i was  
<a onclick="modifyYTiframeseektime('3094')">0:51:34</a> not consulted beforehand  
<a onclick="modifyYTiframeseektime('3095')">0:51:35</a> i didn't even know what the content of  
<a onclick="modifyYTiframeseektime('3098')">0:51:38</a> that video was  
<a onclick="modifyYTiframeseektime('3099')">0:51:39</a> till it was actually released once it  
<a onclick="modifyYTiframeseektime('3102')">0:51:42</a> was released  
<a onclick="modifyYTiframeseektime('3103')">0:51:43</a> i saw it and uh i watched the video  
<a onclick="modifyYTiframeseektime('3106')">0:51:46</a> okay uh thinking back on it now  
<a onclick="modifyYTiframeseektime('3110')">0:51:50</a> was it a smart thing to do because i  
<a onclick="modifyYTiframeseektime('3112')">0:51:52</a> heard imran's explanation now when he  
<a onclick="modifyYTiframeseektime('3114')">0:51:54</a> was doing that video with sergey lip  
<a onclick="modifyYTiframeseektime('3116')">0:51:56</a> was it a smart thing to do okay was it a  
<a onclick="modifyYTiframeseektime('3118')">0:51:58</a> wise thing to do  
<a onclick="modifyYTiframeseektime('3119')">0:51:59</a> because we know that a lot of doubt  
<a onclick="modifyYTiframeseektime('3123')">0:52:03</a> uh has now hit the people's hearts right  
<a onclick="modifyYTiframeseektime('3126')">0:52:06</a> and the general principle with regards  
<a onclick="modifyYTiframeseektime('3129')">0:52:09</a> to um  
<a onclick="modifyYTiframeseektime('3130')">0:52:10</a> spreading doubts and telling your  
<a onclick="modifyYTiframeseektime('3132')">0:52:12</a> friends about it is  
<a onclick="modifyYTiframeseektime('3134')">0:52:14</a> what suffered allah mentioned right  
<a onclick="modifyYTiframeseektime('3145')">0:52:25</a> then let him not relate it to those who  
<a onclick="modifyYTiframeseektime('3146')">0:52:26</a> sit around him  
<a onclick="modifyYTiframeseektime('3148')">0:52:28</a> okay and let him not hit  
<a onclick="modifyYTiframeseektime('3160')">0:52:40</a> the majority of the scholars of the self  
<a onclick="modifyYTiframeseektime('3163')">0:52:43</a> and when we use the word salaf okay uh  
<a onclick="modifyYTiframeseektime('3166')">0:52:46</a> what we're intending by the three golden  
<a onclick="modifyYTiframeseektime('3167')">0:52:47</a> generations not people who are breathing  
<a onclick="modifyYTiframeseektime('3169')">0:52:49</a> here today  
<a onclick="modifyYTiframeseektime('3170')">0:52:50</a> the word has been tarnished the moment  
<a onclick="modifyYTiframeseektime('3172')">0:52:52</a> you will use the word seller people  
<a onclick="modifyYTiframeseektime('3174')">0:52:54</a> begin to think that it's referring to a  
<a onclick="modifyYTiframeseektime('3176')">0:52:56</a> group of people okay  
<a onclick="modifyYTiframeseektime('3178')">0:52:58</a> um we're speaking about the sahaba the  
<a onclick="modifyYTiframeseektime('3180')">0:53:00</a> tabi in the table  
<a onclick="modifyYTiframeseektime('3181')">0:53:01</a> i know the prophet saws  
<a onclick="modifyYTiframeseektime('3185')">0:53:05</a> the best of his my generation those who  
<a onclick="modifyYTiframeseektime('3186')">0:53:06</a> came out those who came after them right  
<a onclick="modifyYTiframeseektime('3188')">0:53:08</a> so he says the majority of the salaf are  
<a onclick="modifyYTiframeseektime('3191')">0:53:11</a> upon this tadeer  
<a onclick="modifyYTiframeseektime('3200')">0:53:20</a> because the hearts are what weak and  
<a onclick="modifyYTiframeseektime('3203')">0:53:23</a> that the  
<a onclick="modifyYTiframeseektime('3204')">0:53:24</a> the doubt it really snatches a person it  
<a onclick="modifyYTiframeseektime('3207')">0:53:27</a> can make you go haywire  
<a onclick="modifyYTiframeseektime('3209')">0:53:29</a> because of that dao it could you see  
<a onclick="modifyYTiframeseektime('3210')">0:53:30</a> what i'm saying  
<a onclick="modifyYTiframeseektime('3212')">0:53:32</a> so now releasing emails and i've heard  
<a onclick="modifyYTiframeseektime('3215')">0:53:35</a> what  
<a onclick="modifyYTiframeseektime('3215')">0:53:35</a> imran's justification is i'm really just  
<a onclick="modifyYTiframeseektime('3217')">0:53:37</a> still trying to  
<a onclick="modifyYTiframeseektime('3218')">0:53:38</a> it's muslim it says  
<a onclick="modifyYTiframeseektime('3224')">0:53:44</a> again like like i said here do you agree  
<a onclick="modifyYTiframeseektime('3226')">0:53:46</a> with this kind of  
<a onclick="modifyYTiframeseektime('3227')">0:53:47</a> though oh and do you think that the the  
<a onclick="modifyYTiframeseektime('3230')">0:53:50</a> ones who came to this conclusion  
<a onclick="modifyYTiframeseektime('3235')">0:53:55</a> what i can say is this is one of my  
<a onclick="modifyYTiframeseektime('3237')">0:53:57</a> regrets right this is one of the regrets  
<a onclick="modifyYTiframeseektime('3238')">0:53:58</a> that i have  
<a onclick="modifyYTiframeseektime('3239')">0:53:59</a> sometimes men being involved in very  
<a onclick="modifyYTiframeseektime('3241')">0:54:01</a> controversial issues  
<a onclick="modifyYTiframeseektime('3243')">0:54:03</a> and things related to public safety and  
<a onclick="modifyYTiframeseektime('3245')">0:54:05</a> public fear  
<a onclick="modifyYTiframeseektime('3248')">0:54:08</a> uh  
<a onclick="modifyYTiframeseektime('3251')">0:54:11</a> that i may have just like saw advice  
<a onclick="modifyYTiframeseektime('3254')">0:54:14</a> from the elderly  
<a onclick="modifyYTiframeseektime('3256')">0:54:16</a> okay you have to understand when this  
<a onclick="modifyYTiframeseektime('3258')">0:54:18</a> video was going even if  
<a onclick="modifyYTiframeseektime('3259')">0:54:19</a> i did have something to say about this  
<a onclick="modifyYTiframeseektime('3262')">0:54:22</a> video being released  
<a onclick="modifyYTiframeseektime('3264')">0:54:24</a> we're all in our twenties at that time i  
<a onclick="modifyYTiframeseektime('3267')">0:54:27</a> think was like 27  
<a onclick="modifyYTiframeseektime('3268')">0:54:28</a> imran really yeah mid-twenties  
<a onclick="modifyYTiframeseektime('3272')">0:54:32</a> um myself are on the same age so  
<a onclick="modifyYTiframeseektime('3276')">0:54:36</a> we're all in our 20s the poet he says  
<a onclick="modifyYTiframeseektime('3279')">0:54:39</a> and you're going to like this line of  
<a onclick="modifyYTiframeseektime('3280')">0:54:40</a> poetry  
<a onclick="modifyYTiframeseektime('3288')">0:54:48</a> if there is an issue that only  
<a onclick="modifyYTiframeseektime('3289')">0:54:49</a> youngsters are  
<a onclick="modifyYTiframeseektime('3291')">0:54:51</a> pushing through or that they are  
<a onclick="modifyYTiframeseektime('3292')">0:54:52</a> carrying  
<a onclick="modifyYTiframeseektime('3294')">0:54:54</a> okay uh you're going to find a  
<a onclick="modifyYTiframeseektime('3297')">0:54:57</a> deficiency in  
<a onclick="modifyYTiframeseektime('3299')">0:54:59</a> that uh issue that they took onto  
<a onclick="modifyYTiframeseektime('3302')">0:55:02</a> themselves right  
<a onclick="modifyYTiframeseektime('3304')">0:55:04</a> so this issue now of making this video  
<a onclick="modifyYTiframeseektime('3306')">0:55:06</a> that has some very great repercussions  
<a onclick="modifyYTiframeseektime('3308')">0:55:08</a> right  
<a onclick="modifyYTiframeseektime('3309')">0:55:09</a> which could put the people's hearts into  
<a onclick="modifyYTiframeseektime('3312')">0:55:12</a> doubt  
<a onclick="modifyYTiframeseektime('3313')">0:55:13</a> and again i'm not saying that his  
<a onclick="modifyYTiframeseektime('3314')">0:55:14</a> justification is wrong or  
<a onclick="modifyYTiframeseektime('3316')">0:55:16</a> the uh person which they had abdul  
<a onclick="modifyYTiframeseektime('3319')">0:55:19</a> rahman made with regards to releasing  
<a onclick="modifyYTiframeseektime('3320')">0:55:20</a> this video  
<a onclick="modifyYTiframeseektime('3322')">0:55:22</a> i'm not even going into that at the  
<a onclick="modifyYTiframeseektime('3323')">0:55:23</a> moment just thinking about it now  
<a onclick="modifyYTiframeseektime('3325')">0:55:25</a> the least we can all agree on that  
<a onclick="modifyYTiframeseektime('3328')">0:55:28</a> many scholars should have been you know  
<a onclick="modifyYTiframeseektime('3330')">0:55:30</a> consulted  
<a onclick="modifyYTiframeseektime('3331')">0:55:31</a> by leaking some of these emails where he  
<a onclick="modifyYTiframeseektime('3334')">0:55:34</a> explicitly states that  
<a onclick="modifyYTiframeseektime('3335')">0:55:35</a> having doubts about the preservation of  
<a onclick="modifyYTiframeseektime('3337')">0:55:37</a> the quran or whatever have you  
<a onclick="modifyYTiframeseektime('3338')">0:55:38</a> okay and maybe some of the elders maybe  
<a onclick="modifyYTiframeseektime('3340')">0:55:40</a> and maybe a lot of that stuff  
<a onclick="modifyYTiframeseektime('3342')">0:55:42</a> yeah i mean from michael with subsequent  
<a onclick="modifyYTiframeseektime('3344')">0:55:44</a> conversations  
<a onclick="modifyYTiframeseektime('3345')">0:55:45</a> uh i'm not gonna say they can have  
<a onclick="modifyYTiframeseektime('3346')">0:55:46</a> context but i'm a more nuanced than that  
<a onclick="modifyYTiframeseektime('3349')">0:55:49</a> and  
<a onclick="modifyYTiframeseektime('3350')">0:55:50</a> and this is why it's very important  
<a onclick="modifyYTiframeseektime('3351')">0:55:51</a> because it can be taken out of context  
<a onclick="modifyYTiframeseektime('3353')">0:55:53</a> as well  
<a onclick="modifyYTiframeseektime('3354')">0:55:54</a> it's more important that for someone and  
<a onclick="modifyYTiframeseektime('3356')">0:55:56</a> this is very like you mentioned you  
<a onclick="modifyYTiframeseektime('3357')">0:55:57</a> alluded to it is like hell magenta  
<a onclick="modifyYTiframeseektime('3360')">0:56:00</a> um and this is the right so this is the  
<a onclick="modifyYTiframeseektime('3362')">0:56:02</a> nas  
<a onclick="modifyYTiframeseektime('3364')">0:56:04</a> and so even for me i was thinking uh i  
<a onclick="modifyYTiframeseektime('3366')">0:56:06</a> you know i had discussion with you about  
<a onclick="modifyYTiframeseektime('3367')">0:56:07</a> this before if this is the justification  
<a onclick="modifyYTiframeseektime('3369')">0:56:09</a> you have muslim or let's say even in  
<a onclick="modifyYTiframeseektime('3372')">0:56:12</a> this case  
<a onclick="modifyYTiframeseektime('3374')">0:56:14</a> versus the  
<a onclick="modifyYTiframeseektime('3380')">0:56:20</a> and so on that you have to keep private  
<a onclick="modifyYTiframeseektime('3382')">0:56:22</a> information private  
<a onclick="modifyYTiframeseektime('3384')">0:56:24</a> if you think that the muslim is is is  
<a onclick="modifyYTiframeseektime('3387')">0:56:27</a> is there but then you have an us so  
<a onclick="modifyYTiframeseektime('3390')">0:56:30</a> which which goes before i think i think  
<a onclick="modifyYTiframeseektime('3392')">0:56:32</a> the discussion that he was bringing was  
<a onclick="modifyYTiframeseektime('3393')">0:56:33</a> revolving around  
<a onclick="modifyYTiframeseektime('3395')">0:56:35</a> him  
<a onclick="modifyYTiframeseektime('3399')">0:56:39</a> now spreading some of this information  
<a onclick="modifyYTiframeseektime('3401')">0:56:41</a> is email is something that is bad  
<a onclick="modifyYTiframeseektime('3404')">0:56:44</a> right okay and the problem is  
<a onclick="modifyYTiframeseektime('3407')">0:56:47</a> yeah later on bring this out subtly  
<a onclick="modifyYTiframeseektime('3411')">0:56:51</a> to the people in his lectures again it's  
<a onclick="modifyYTiframeseektime('3413')">0:56:53</a> something that is problematic  
<a onclick="modifyYTiframeseektime('3415')">0:56:55</a> so he was coming from the angle of the  
<a onclick="modifyYTiframeseektime('3417')">0:56:57</a> lesser retrieval the issue is we don't  
<a onclick="modifyYTiframeseektime('3418')">0:56:58</a> know what he's going to come up with  
<a onclick="modifyYTiframeseektime('3419')">0:56:59</a> and and still it could be in development  
<a onclick="modifyYTiframeseektime('3421')">0:57:01</a> yeah i i fully understand  
<a onclick="modifyYTiframeseektime('3422')">0:57:02</a> i fully understand but then they use as  
<a onclick="modifyYTiframeseektime('3424')">0:57:04</a> a justification what he did with  
<a onclick="modifyYTiframeseektime('3426')">0:57:06</a> juju yeah about the whole zombie thing  
<a onclick="modifyYTiframeseektime('3429')">0:57:09</a> again it's not something as you just  
<a onclick="modifyYTiframeseektime('3431')">0:57:11</a> mentioned now it's not qatari that he's

<a onclick="modifyYTiframeseektime('3434')">0:57:14</a> it's not even that it's not that your  
<a onclick="modifyYTiframeseektime('3436')">0:57:16</a> understanding of what he thinks is what  
<a onclick="modifyYTiframeseektime('3438')">0:57:18</a> it was what the understanding is  
<a onclick="modifyYTiframeseektime('3440')">0:57:20</a> you could definitely say that you could  
<a onclick="modifyYTiframeseektime('3441')">0:57:21</a> definitely say that but as you mentioned  
<a onclick="modifyYTiframeseektime('3443')">0:57:23</a> there is no source which speak about  
<a onclick="modifyYTiframeseektime('3445')">0:57:25</a> what you call it  
<a onclick="modifyYTiframeseektime('3446')">0:57:26</a> preserving the the the secrets of the  
<a onclick="modifyYTiframeseektime('3449')">0:57:29</a> people even that narration i mentioned  
<a onclick="modifyYTiframeseektime('3450')">0:57:30</a> earlier  
<a onclick="modifyYTiframeseektime('3456')">0:57:36</a> what does it mean like secrets being  
<a onclick="modifyYTiframeseektime('3458')">0:57:38</a> revealed to the people right  
<a onclick="modifyYTiframeseektime('3460')">0:57:40</a> one thing that really touched me is this  
<a onclick="modifyYTiframeseektime('3462')">0:57:42</a> narration i'm going to mention in a  
<a onclick="modifyYTiframeseektime('3463')">0:57:43</a> moment but before that the messiah  
<a onclick="modifyYTiframeseektime('3465')">0:57:45</a> says  
<a onclick="modifyYTiframeseektime('3470')">0:57:50</a> if somebody you know tells you something  
<a onclick="modifyYTiframeseektime('3472')">0:57:52</a> and then he begins to look  
<a onclick="modifyYTiframeseektime('3474')">0:57:54</a> you get indications that this is a  
<a onclick="modifyYTiframeseektime('3476')">0:57:56</a> secret yeah of course this isn't a man  
<a onclick="modifyYTiframeseektime('3478')">0:57:58</a> it's a trust but look at this narration  
<a onclick="modifyYTiframeseektime('3481')">0:58:01</a> right  
<a onclick="modifyYTiframeseektime('3484')">0:58:04</a> he said um  
<a onclick="modifyYTiframeseektime('3496')">0:58:16</a> and he sent me to go and do something  
<a onclick="modifyYTiframeseektime('3500')">0:58:20</a> and i ended up becoming late my mom was  
<a onclick="modifyYTiframeseektime('3503')">0:58:23</a> waiting for me and i was late right  
<a onclick="modifyYTiframeseektime('3505')">0:58:25</a> so when i came home he she asked him  
<a onclick="modifyYTiframeseektime('3509')">0:58:29</a> why was you late he said  
<a onclick="modifyYTiframeseektime('3512')">0:58:32</a> he was in some  
<a onclick="modifyYTiframeseektime('3520')">0:58:40</a> what did he ask you to do ana malek  
<a onclick="modifyYTiframeseektime('3524')">0:58:44</a> responded back and he said  
<a onclick="modifyYTiframeseektime('3526')">0:58:46</a> this is a secret look at her response  
<a onclick="modifyYTiframeseektime('3530')">0:58:50</a> and allah i think every single one of us  
<a onclick="modifyYTiframeseektime('3532')">0:58:52</a> can take really just  
<a onclick="modifyYTiframeseektime('3534')">0:58:54</a> um inspiration and a lesson from this  
<a onclick="modifyYTiframeseektime('3537')">0:58:57</a> right  
<a onclick="modifyYTiframeseektime('3549')">0:59:09</a> now comes in a negative context in  
<a onclick="modifyYTiframeseektime('3550')">0:59:10</a> arabic language indicates  
<a onclick="modifyYTiframeseektime('3552')">0:59:12</a> generality what do we do as muslims  
<a onclick="modifyYTiframeseektime('3555')">0:59:15</a> someone told us something the first  
<a onclick="modifyYTiframeseektime('3557')">0:59:17</a> people that we tell is what the wives  
<a onclick="modifyYTiframeseektime('3560')">0:59:20</a> my wife is not with an s but  
<a onclick="modifyYTiframeseektime('3563')">0:59:23</a> we tell the wife okay here it's i said  
<a onclick="modifyYTiframeseektime('3565')">0:59:25</a> nobody  
<a onclick="modifyYTiframeseektime('3567')">0:59:27</a> we might tell our close ones every  
<a onclick="modifyYTiframeseektime('3569')">0:59:29</a> friend has a friend right and  
<a onclick="modifyYTiframeseektime('3572')">0:59:32</a> um every friend has a friend  
<a onclick="modifyYTiframeseektime('3575')">0:59:35</a> and you know what tends to happen say  
<a onclick="modifyYTiframeseektime('3576')">0:59:36</a> well you're not gonna tell anyone  
<a onclick="modifyYTiframeseektime('3578')">0:59:38</a> and he goes to someone else say well  
<a onclick="modifyYTiframeseektime('3580')">0:59:40</a> he's not gonna tell anyone and he goes  
<a onclick="modifyYTiframeseektime('3581')">0:59:41</a> to someone else  
<a onclick="modifyYTiframeseektime('3582')">0:59:42</a> i can before you know where that secret  
<a onclick="modifyYTiframeseektime('3584')">0:59:44</a> is turned into chinese whispers while  
<a onclick="modifyYTiframeseektime('3586')">0:59:46</a> the name of allah is being used in vain  
<a onclick="modifyYTiframeseektime('3588')">0:59:48</a> so this is the assal okay this is the  
<a onclick="modifyYTiframeseektime('3591')">0:59:51</a> assad with regards to discussions that  
<a onclick="modifyYTiframeseektime('3592')">0:59:52</a> happen in privately  
<a onclick="modifyYTiframeseektime('3594')">0:59:54</a> in private but that particular issue as  
<a onclick="modifyYTiframeseektime('3596')">0:59:56</a> to whether this is something that is  
<a onclick="modifyYTiframeseektime('3597')">0:59:57</a> justified because the lesser of the two  
<a onclick="modifyYTiframeseektime('3599')">0:59:59</a> evils  
<a onclick="modifyYTiframeseektime('3602')">1:00:02</a> on this scale thinking about it in  
<a onclick="modifyYTiframeseektime('3605')">1:00:05</a> hindsight  
<a onclick="modifyYTiframeseektime('3607')">1:00:07</a> which involves the religion of people to  
<a onclick="modifyYTiframeseektime('3610')">1:00:10</a> be doubted  
<a onclick="modifyYTiframeseektime('3613')">1:00:13</a> because at that time i was told that a  
<a onclick="modifyYTiframeseektime('3615')">1:00:15</a> series of refutations or clarifications  
<a onclick="modifyYTiframeseektime('3617')">1:00:17</a> are going to be made with regards to  
<a onclick="modifyYTiframeseektime('3619')">1:00:19</a> the leaking of the emails which i didn't  
<a onclick="modifyYTiframeseektime('3621')">1:00:21</a> which  
<a onclick="modifyYTiframeseektime('3622')">1:00:22</a> didn't happen but now um  
<a onclick="modifyYTiframeseektime('3625')">1:00:25</a> when you did that video with uh startup  
<a onclick="modifyYTiframeseektime('3628')">1:00:28</a> i don't know whether he clarified  
<a onclick="modifyYTiframeseektime('3629')">1:00:29</a> everything or he's planning to clarify i  
<a onclick="modifyYTiframeseektime('3631')">1:00:31</a> still haven't watched it i mean the  
<a onclick="modifyYTiframeseektime('3632')">1:00:32</a> thing is like i said  
<a onclick="modifyYTiframeseektime('3633')">1:00:33</a> before i'm i've i've spoken to you  
<a onclick="modifyYTiframeseektime('3635')">1:00:35</a> myself  
<a onclick="modifyYTiframeseektime('3636')">1:00:36</a> and and the stuff is that he is  
<a onclick="modifyYTiframeseektime('3639')">1:00:39</a> constantly reviewing  
<a onclick="modifyYTiframeseektime('3640')">1:00:40</a> and reading and changing and  
<a onclick="modifyYTiframeseektime('3644')">1:00:44</a> you know what i mean so that's why i  
<a onclick="modifyYTiframeseektime('3645')">1:00:45</a> think this is very important  
<a onclick="modifyYTiframeseektime('3647')">1:00:47</a> if something is to be refuted publicly  
<a onclick="modifyYTiframeseektime('3649')">1:00:49</a> it has to be said publicly  
<a onclick="modifyYTiframeseektime('3651')">1:00:51</a> and and that's why it's very dangerous  
<a onclick="modifyYTiframeseektime('3653')">1:00:53</a> for someone  
<a onclick="modifyYTiframeseektime('3654')">1:00:54</a> to to challenge that which is private  
<a onclick="modifyYTiframeseektime('3658')">1:00:58</a> privately uh publicly and vice versa  
<a onclick="modifyYTiframeseektime('3662')">1:01:02</a> but i think we agree on this point yeah  
<a onclick="modifyYTiframeseektime('3663')">1:01:03</a> and i think at the end of the day again  
<a onclick="modifyYTiframeseektime('3665')">1:01:05</a> it goes back to that same point i  
<a onclick="modifyYTiframeseektime('3666')">1:01:06</a> mentioned earlier  
<a onclick="modifyYTiframeseektime('3668')">1:01:08</a> that sometimes it's best to take  
<a onclick="modifyYTiframeseektime('3670')">1:01:10</a> sensitive issues back to the elders  
<a onclick="modifyYTiframeseektime('3672')">1:01:12</a> scholars exactly every scholar has  
<a onclick="modifyYTiframeseektime('3674')">1:01:14</a> somebody that he goes back to  
<a onclick="modifyYTiframeseektime('3676')">1:01:16</a> okay so do you think there was too much  
<a onclick="modifyYTiframeseektime('3679')">1:01:19</a> kind of issue had been done  
<a onclick="modifyYTiframeseektime('3680')">1:01:20</a> by the group members yeah maybe so okay  
<a onclick="modifyYTiframeseektime('3682')">1:01:22</a> something very powerful that i want to  
<a onclick="modifyYTiframeseektime('3683')">1:01:23</a> mention with regards to what even hasn't  
<a onclick="modifyYTiframeseektime('3684')">1:01:24</a> mentioned  
<a onclick="modifyYTiframeseektime('3685')">1:01:25</a> right and i really just wish that in the  
<a onclick="modifyYTiframeseektime('3687')">1:01:27</a> past that i acted upon it  
<a onclick="modifyYTiframeseektime('3689')">1:01:29</a> he said  
<a onclick="modifyYTiframeseektime('3693')">1:01:33</a> how beautiful is silence in very  
<a onclick="modifyYTiframeseektime('3695')">1:01:35</a> sensitive issues  
<a onclick="modifyYTiframeseektime('3704')">1:01:44</a> how often have we seen people who are  
<a onclick="modifyYTiframeseektime('3706')">1:01:46</a> destroyed because of what they say with  
<a onclick="modifyYTiframeseektime('3707')">1:01:47</a> their tongues  
<a onclick="modifyYTiframeseektime('3708')">1:01:48</a> but we've never seen anybody who who's  
<a onclick="modifyYTiframeseektime('3711')">1:01:51</a> destroyed himself because he was silent  
<a onclick="modifyYTiframeseektime('3715')">1:01:55</a> so these issues i just kind of sometimes  
<a onclick="modifyYTiframeseektime('3718')">1:01:58</a> wish that  
<a onclick="modifyYTiframeseektime('3720')">1:02:00</a> um i may not have what you call it  
<a onclick="modifyYTiframeseektime('3724')">1:02:04</a> partake or partook  
<a onclick="modifyYTiframeseektime('3727')">1:02:07</a> in any of them and um even now  
<a onclick="modifyYTiframeseektime('3730')">1:02:10</a> subhanallah this video that i was making  
<a onclick="modifyYTiframeseektime('3733')">1:02:13</a> i consulted a lot of the elders uh  
<a onclick="modifyYTiframeseektime('3736')">1:02:16</a> there's a number of them they they don't  
<a onclick="modifyYTiframeseektime('3738')">1:02:18</a> agree like they're not with they clearly  
<a onclick="modifyYTiframeseektime('3740')">1:02:20</a> explicitly like  
<a onclick="modifyYTiframeseektime('3741')">1:02:21</a> osama uh stevenson who runs medina  
<a onclick="modifyYTiframeseektime('3744')">1:02:24</a> college i think you've met him before  
<a onclick="modifyYTiframeseektime('3746')">1:02:26</a> right  
<a onclick="modifyYTiframeseektime('3747')">1:02:27</a> and other brothers as well but i thought  
<a onclick="modifyYTiframeseektime('3748')">1:02:28</a> their permission to maybe mention their  
<a onclick="modifyYTiframeseektime('3750')">1:02:30</a> names and they said  
<a onclick="modifyYTiframeseektime('3751')">1:02:31</a> just leave out like even they clearly  
<a onclick="modifyYTiframeseektime('3754')">1:02:34</a> stated that they don't have anything to  
<a onclick="modifyYTiframeseektime('3757')">1:02:37</a> do with the dawah of  
<a onclick="modifyYTiframeseektime('3758')">1:02:38</a> dr haytham they don't agree with his  
<a onclick="modifyYTiframeseektime('3760')">1:02:40</a> views and the stances that he's taken  
<a onclick="modifyYTiframeseektime('3762')">1:02:42</a> while at the same time they said to me  
<a onclick="modifyYTiframeseektime('3764')">1:02:44</a> that was oppression man  
<a onclick="modifyYTiframeseektime('3767')">1:02:47</a> that thing that was said about dr  
<a onclick="modifyYTiframeseektime('3768')">1:02:48</a> haytham and the way he was made to look  
<a onclick="modifyYTiframeseektime('3770')">1:02:50</a> out  
<a onclick="modifyYTiframeseektime('3771')">1:02:51</a> it wasn't it wasn't you know with  
<a onclick="modifyYTiframeseektime('3773')">1:02:53</a> himself really wasn't with fairness  
<a onclick="modifyYTiframeseektime('3776')">1:02:56</a> you know so um even though they've got  
<a onclick="modifyYTiframeseektime('3779')">1:02:59</a> nothing to do they don't have  
<a onclick="modifyYTiframeseektime('3780')">1:03:00</a> cooperation with dr haitham and they're  
<a onclick="modifyYTiframeseektime('3782')">1:03:02</a> still saying  
<a onclick="modifyYTiframeseektime('3783')">1:03:03</a> this particular thing and this goes back  
<a onclick="modifyYTiframeseektime('3785')">1:03:05</a> to what i mentioned earlier  
<a onclick="modifyYTiframeseektime('3786')">1:03:06</a> if you're a real sunni a person who's  
<a onclick="modifyYTiframeseektime('3788')">1:03:08</a> following the truth and  
<a onclick="modifyYTiframeseektime('3790')">1:03:10</a> upon the guidance of the seraph if  
<a onclick="modifyYTiframeseektime('3792')">1:03:12</a> you're going to refuse somebody has to  
<a onclick="modifyYTiframeseektime('3793')">1:03:13</a> be with ill  
<a onclick="modifyYTiframeseektime('3794')">1:03:14</a> and he  
<a onclick="modifyYTiframeseektime('3802')">1:03:22</a> justice is that you weigh your opponents  
<a onclick="modifyYTiframeseektime('3805')">1:03:25</a> huh with the same bold that you weigh  
<a onclick="modifyYTiframeseektime('3808')">1:03:28</a> yourself with  
<a onclick="modifyYTiframeseektime('3808')">1:03:28</a> meaning you treat the people the same  
<a onclick="modifyYTiframeseektime('3810')">1:03:30</a> way you like to be treated  
<a onclick="modifyYTiframeseektime('3813')">1:03:33</a> i mean there is even more isn't it  
<a onclick="modifyYTiframeseektime('3820')">1:03:40</a> even if it is against yourselves and  
<a onclick="modifyYTiframeseektime('3822')">1:03:42</a> your parents and um  
<a onclick="modifyYTiframeseektime('3824')">1:03:44</a> well you know what something that really  
<a onclick="modifyYTiframeseektime('3825')">1:03:45</a> touched me was um  
<a onclick="modifyYTiframeseektime('3828')">1:03:48</a> the way ebeneutemia was with his enemies  
<a onclick="modifyYTiframeseektime('3833')">1:03:53</a> his student he mentioned his madaja  
<a onclick="modifyYTiframeseektime('3835')">1:03:55</a> salikin right  
<a onclick="modifyYTiframeseektime('3850')">1:04:10</a> some of his own friends mentioned i wish  
<a onclick="modifyYTiframeseektime('3853')">1:04:13</a> i could treat my friends  
<a onclick="modifyYTiframeseektime('3855')">1:04:15</a> the same way that ibrutimya can treat  
<a onclick="modifyYTiframeseektime('3857')">1:04:17</a> his enemies  
<a onclick="modifyYTiframeseektime('3859')">1:04:19</a> or the same way entertainment treats his  
<a onclick="modifyYTiframeseektime('3860')">1:04:20</a> enemies and his opponents  
<a onclick="modifyYTiframeseektime('3863')">1:04:23</a> right i mean i thought we had a  
<a onclick="modifyYTiframeseektime('3864')">1:04:24</a> different approach to me remember that  
<a onclick="modifyYTiframeseektime('3866')">1:04:26</a> me

<a onclick="modifyYTiframeseektime('3967')">1:06:07</a> and we had to be fair right  
<a onclick="modifyYTiframeseektime('3969')">1:06:09</a> um do you think it was a good idea to  
<a onclick="modifyYTiframeseektime('3972')">1:06:12</a> bring  
<a onclick="modifyYTiframeseektime('3972')">1:06:12</a> dr yasser like with a lot of these  
<a onclick="modifyYTiframeseektime('3975')">1:06:15</a> doubts that are surrounding him and some  
<a onclick="modifyYTiframeseektime('3977')">1:06:17</a> of these issues that he's having  
<a onclick="modifyYTiframeseektime('3979')">1:06:19</a> okay and ask him some of these questions  
<a onclick="modifyYTiframeseektime('3982')">1:06:22</a> i think so because  
<a onclick="modifyYTiframeseektime('3983')">1:06:23</a> because now the christians are partying  
<a onclick="modifyYTiframeseektime('3985')">1:06:25</a> what i've seen in my own eyes  
<a onclick="modifyYTiframeseektime('3987')">1:06:27</a> they're commenting on different videos  
<a onclick="modifyYTiframeseektime('3988')">1:06:28</a> i've been sent screenshots do you think  
<a onclick="modifyYTiframeseektime('3990')">1:06:30</a> it was a good idea i think to be honest  
<a onclick="modifyYTiframeseektime('3991')">1:06:31</a> the idea for me to ask him those very  
<a onclick="modifyYTiframeseektime('3993')">1:06:33</a> specific questions  
<a onclick="modifyYTiframeseektime('3995')">1:06:35</a> were was a bad idea and because i'll  
<a onclick="modifyYTiframeseektime('3997')">1:06:37</a> tell you why it's a bad idea not because  
<a onclick="modifyYTiframeseektime('3999')">1:06:39</a> there should be any reason why  
<a onclick="modifyYTiframeseektime('4000')">1:06:40</a> christians missionaries or  
<a onclick="modifyYTiframeseektime('4002')">1:06:42</a> evangelists should be it's a bad idea  
<a onclick="modifyYTiframeseektime('4004')">1:06:44</a> because we were talking about complex  
<a onclick="modifyYTiframeseektime('4005')">1:06:45</a> issues  
<a onclick="modifyYTiframeseektime('4006')">1:06:46</a> and this suffer had no idea what we  
<a onclick="modifyYTiframeseektime('4009')">1:06:49</a> were even trying to communicate and they  
<a onclick="modifyYTiframeseektime('4011')">1:06:51</a> did distort what he was saying and he  
<a onclick="modifyYTiframeseektime('4013')">1:06:53</a> put out a public statement saying i  
<a onclick="modifyYTiframeseektime('4014')">1:06:54</a> don't agree with what you're saying it's  
<a onclick="modifyYTiframeseektime('4015')">1:06:55</a> very important by the way  
<a onclick="modifyYTiframeseektime('4017')">1:06:57</a> he did this to me i don't think i saw it  
<a onclick="modifyYTiframeseektime('4018')">1:06:58</a> no no he put it on facebook he said  
<a onclick="modifyYTiframeseektime('4020')">1:07:00</a> whatever you're saying i believe the  
<a onclick="modifyYTiframeseektime('4021')">1:07:01</a> quran is preserved a hundred percent and  
<a onclick="modifyYTiframeseektime('4023')">1:07:03</a> you know well he he refuted that but  
<a onclick="modifyYTiframeseektime('4025')">1:07:05</a> me asking him very specific questions  
<a onclick="modifyYTiframeseektime('4028')">1:07:08</a> like if i give you a mushaf and  
<a onclick="modifyYTiframeseektime('4029')">1:07:09</a> uh would it be exactly what the prophet  
<a onclick="modifyYTiframeseektime('4033')">1:07:13</a> now  
<a onclick="modifyYTiframeseektime('4034')">1:07:14</a> i know he has a view which is that's not  
<a onclick="modifyYTiframeseektime('4036')">1:07:16</a> the case that's  
<a onclick="modifyYTiframeseektime('4037')">1:07:17</a> traditional view and it would be a mix  
<a onclick="modifyYTiframeseektime('4039')">1:07:19</a> of the like he said on the podcast it  
<a onclick="modifyYTiframeseektime('4040')">1:07:20</a> would be a mix of  
<a onclick="modifyYTiframeseektime('4042')">1:07:22</a> which really to us is not problematic  
<a onclick="modifyYTiframeseektime('4043')">1:07:23</a> view right if it's a if he's  
<a onclick="modifyYTiframeseektime('4045')">1:07:25</a> if we extend obviously if he's if you're  
<a onclick="modifyYTiframeseektime('4048')">1:07:28</a> saying there's more  
<a onclick="modifyYTiframeseektime('4049')">1:07:29</a> things that he's saying that could be  
<a onclick="modifyYTiframeseektime('4050')">1:07:30</a> problematic we have to see that publicly  
<a onclick="modifyYTiframeseektime('4052')">1:07:32</a> right because it hasn't come with that  
<a onclick="modifyYTiframeseektime('4053')">1:07:33</a> publicly yet  
<a onclick="modifyYTiframeseektime('4054')">1:07:34</a> but that what he said in the podcast  
<a onclick="modifyYTiframeseektime('4057')">1:07:37</a> yeah  
<a onclick="modifyYTiframeseektime('4057')">1:07:37</a> was not anything near kufr what he said  
<a onclick="modifyYTiframeseektime('4060')">1:07:40</a> in the  
<a onclick="modifyYTiframeseektime('4060')">1:07:40</a> in the podcast was nothing free or or  
<a onclick="modifyYTiframeseektime('4064')">1:07:44</a> it was just something which was you know  
<a onclick="modifyYTiframeseektime('4066')">1:07:46</a> how he was being  
<a onclick="modifyYTiframeseektime('4067')">1:07:47</a> he was being charitable right and  
<a onclick="modifyYTiframeseektime('4069')">1:07:49</a> because he  
<a onclick="modifyYTiframeseektime('4070')">1:07:50</a> like he like he said the thing he's got  
<a onclick="modifyYTiframeseektime('4072')">1:07:52</a> this kind of academic hat that he puts  
<a onclick="modifyYTiframeseektime('4073')">1:07:53</a> on right  
<a onclick="modifyYTiframeseektime('4074')">1:07:54</a> so he put the academic hat on and he's  
<a onclick="modifyYTiframeseektime('4076')">1:07:56</a> speaking charitably right and speaking  
<a onclick="modifyYTiframeseektime('4078')">1:07:58</a> honestly  
<a onclick="modifyYTiframeseektime('4079')">1:07:59</a> and that honesty and that charitable  
<a onclick="modifyYTiframeseektime('4082')">1:08:02</a> speech  
<a onclick="modifyYTiframeseektime('4082')">1:08:02</a> which is actually i've been looking at  
<a onclick="modifyYTiframeseektime('4084')">1:08:04</a> these messiah illinois  
<a onclick="modifyYTiframeseektime('4085')">1:08:05</a> it's been misconstrued by them and has  
<a onclick="modifyYTiframeseektime('4088')">1:08:08</a> been taken out of context by them and  
<a onclick="modifyYTiframeseektime('4089')">1:08:09</a> they see as a reason to celebrate like  
<a onclick="modifyYTiframeseektime('4091')">1:08:11</a> you said  
<a onclick="modifyYTiframeseektime('4091')">1:08:11</a> which is totally bartender false and so  
<a onclick="modifyYTiframeseektime('4094')">1:08:14</a> i think from that angle asking them  
<a onclick="modifyYTiframeseektime('4096')">1:08:16</a> those very technical specific questions  
<a onclick="modifyYTiframeseektime('4098')">1:08:18</a> was totally for me the wrong thing to do  
<a onclick="modifyYTiframeseektime('4101')">1:08:21</a> especially knowing that there could be a  
<a onclick="modifyYTiframeseektime('4102')">1:08:22</a> potential he could answer in that  
<a onclick="modifyYTiframeseektime('4104')">1:08:24</a> controversial way because he started to  
<a onclick="modifyYTiframeseektime('4106')">1:08:26</a> cut you but  
<a onclick="modifyYTiframeseektime('4107')">1:08:27</a> remember when i mentioned earlier um  
<a onclick="modifyYTiframeseektime('4109')">1:08:29</a> what suffered he says  
<a onclick="modifyYTiframeseektime('4112')">1:08:32</a> whoever he is in innovation i think you  
<a onclick="modifyYTiframeseektime('4115')">1:08:35</a> know these doubts and these  
<a onclick="modifyYTiframeseektime('4116')">1:08:36</a> the way he's kind of putting it for me  
<a onclick="modifyYTiframeseektime('4120')">1:08:40</a> right i don't hear anything for me do  
<a onclick="modifyYTiframeseektime('4122')">1:08:42</a> you see what i'm saying so  
<a onclick="modifyYTiframeseektime('4123')">1:08:43</a> i was asking him and obviously what he  
<a onclick="modifyYTiframeseektime('4126')">1:08:46</a> came with was something  
<a onclick="modifyYTiframeseektime('4127')">1:08:47</a> which the the articulation was  
<a onclick="modifyYTiframeseektime('4129')">1:08:49</a> misconstrued by these people because he  
<a onclick="modifyYTiframeseektime('4130')">1:08:50</a> was speaking charitably speaking in an  
<a onclick="modifyYTiframeseektime('4132')">1:08:52</a> academic way i mean and and i think he  
<a onclick="modifyYTiframeseektime('4134')">1:08:54</a> needs to kind of think about  
<a onclick="modifyYTiframeseektime('4136')">1:08:56</a> the way he puts things across 100 that's  
<a onclick="modifyYTiframeseektime('4139')">1:08:59</a> something he'll look at i'm  
<a onclick="modifyYTiframeseektime('4140')">1:09:00</a> 100 sure we'll all look at the thing is  
<a onclick="modifyYTiframeseektime('4143')">1:09:03</a> my  
<a onclick="modifyYTiframeseektime('4143')">1:09:03</a> my platform that we're speaking from now  
<a onclick="modifyYTiframeseektime('4145')">1:09:05</a> everything has to be watertight because  
<a onclick="modifyYTiframeseektime('4148')">1:09:08</a> who is going to be the first person  
<a onclick="modifyYTiframeseektime('4149')">1:09:09</a> that's watching i know people are  
<a onclick="modifyYTiframeseektime('4150')">1:09:10</a> watching it now that are going to be  
<a onclick="modifyYTiframeseektime('4151')">1:09:11</a> non-muslims not only that by enemies of  
<a onclick="modifyYTiframeseektime('4152')">1:09:12</a> islam  
<a onclick="modifyYTiframeseektime('4153')">1:09:13</a> now he's if you're speaking in the  
<a onclick="modifyYTiframeseektime('4154')">1:09:14</a> university right which is used to do it  
<a onclick="modifyYTiframeseektime('4156')">1:09:16</a> as a professor you're not going to speak  
<a onclick="modifyYTiframeseektime('4158')">1:09:18</a> in the same way in a political  
<a onclick="modifyYTiframeseektime('4160')">1:09:20</a> water type way where you're going to  
<a onclick="modifyYTiframeseektime('4161')">1:09:21</a> speak in a little bit more relaxed way  
<a onclick="modifyYTiframeseektime('4162')">1:09:22</a> you're going to have a more  
<a onclick="modifyYTiframeseektime('4163')">1:09:23</a> more nuanced approach  
<a onclick="modifyYTiframeseektime('4166')">1:09:26</a> let's say for this because these people  
<a onclick="modifyYTiframeseektime('4170')">1:09:30</a> are ready to take anything out of your  
<a onclick="modifyYTiframeseektime('4172')">1:09:32</a> so i get this point yeah and i think  
<a onclick="modifyYTiframeseektime('4173')">1:09:33</a> he's everyone's learning from this but  
<a onclick="modifyYTiframeseektime('4176')">1:09:36</a> i remember for me i have to take  
<a onclick="modifyYTiframeseektime('4177')">1:09:37</a> responsibility for my own my what my own  
<a onclick="modifyYTiframeseektime('4179')">1:09:39</a> actions are  
<a onclick="modifyYTiframeseektime('4180')">1:09:40</a> i shouldn't have asked the doctor  
<a onclick="modifyYTiframeseektime('4183')">1:09:43</a> i should have asked him a question  
<a onclick="modifyYTiframeseektime('4185')">1:09:45</a> specifically about  
<a onclick="modifyYTiframeseektime('4187')">1:09:47</a> something very technical to a lay  
<a onclick="modifyYTiframeseektime('4188')">1:09:48</a> audience which i know he has  
<a onclick="modifyYTiframeseektime('4191')">1:09:51</a> opinions which which i'm not going to  
<a onclick="modifyYTiframeseektime('4194')">1:09:54</a> say are controversial  
<a onclick="modifyYTiframeseektime('4195')">1:09:55</a> i'm going to say are anti-normative in  
<a onclick="modifyYTiframeseektime('4198')">1:09:58</a> many aspects or some things which are  
<a onclick="modifyYTiframeseektime('4200')">1:10:00</a> not  
<a onclick="modifyYTiframeseektime('4201')">1:10:01</a> completely in line with the traditional  
<a onclick="modifyYTiframeseektime('4202')">1:10:02</a> view you see what i mean  
<a onclick="modifyYTiframeseektime('4204')">1:10:04</a> so i should not ask him that question  
<a onclick="modifyYTiframeseektime('4206')">1:10:06</a> especially before he hasn't even  
<a onclick="modifyYTiframeseektime('4207')">1:10:07</a> published anything about it  
<a onclick="modifyYTiframeseektime('4209')">1:10:09</a> the the classical view let's call it the  
<a onclick="modifyYTiframeseektime('4211')">1:10:11</a> view of the quran let's say  
<a onclick="modifyYTiframeseektime('4213')">1:10:13</a> so so that's it uh and and um  
<a onclick="modifyYTiframeseektime('4216')">1:10:16</a> the fact that you're i think that's  
<a onclick="modifyYTiframeseektime('4218')">1:10:18</a> jason i think that that i really regret  
<a onclick="modifyYTiframeseektime('4219')">1:10:19</a> that actually yeah  
<a onclick="modifyYTiframeseektime('4220')">1:10:20</a> asking him because not only regret on  
<a onclick="modifyYTiframeseektime('4222')">1:10:22</a> the on on on the front that  
<a onclick="modifyYTiframeseektime('4224')">1:10:24</a> um i asked him that question he answered  
<a onclick="modifyYTiframeseektime('4226')">1:10:26</a> in the way that he did yeah which was  
<a onclick="modifyYTiframeseektime('4227')">1:10:27</a> charitable and all that  
<a onclick="modifyYTiframeseektime('4229')">1:10:29</a> but also because of the the the way in  
<a onclick="modifyYTiframeseektime('4231')">1:10:31</a> which  
<a onclick="modifyYTiframeseektime('4232')">1:10:32</a> it's been manipulated and distorted  
<a onclick="modifyYTiframeseektime('4235')">1:10:35</a> the consequences of it i personally feel  
<a onclick="modifyYTiframeseektime('4238')">1:10:38</a> like  
<a onclick="modifyYTiframeseektime('4239')">1:10:39</a> that could have been avoided if i had  
<a onclick="modifyYTiframeseektime('4240')">1:10:40</a> not asked that question and i'll take  
<a onclick="modifyYTiframeseektime('4241')">1:10:41</a> responsibility for that hmm  
<a onclick="modifyYTiframeseektime('4244')">1:10:44</a> yeah yeah so on these  
<a onclick="modifyYTiframeseektime('4248')">1:10:48</a> like i i always tell brothers this right  
<a onclick="modifyYTiframeseektime('4250')">1:10:50</a> and i'm the first person to advise  
<a onclick="modifyYTiframeseektime('4252')">1:10:52</a> myself  
<a onclick="modifyYTiframeseektime('4253')">1:10:53</a> something like mentioned right so  
<a onclick="modifyYTiframeseektime('4267')">1:11:07</a> indeed just speaking in a very general  
<a onclick="modifyYTiframeseektime('4269')">1:11:09</a> way sometimes  
<a onclick="modifyYTiframeseektime('4270')">1:11:10</a> what does it cause without clarification  
<a onclick="modifyYTiframeseektime('4272')">1:11:12</a> what does it cause it causes  
<a onclick="modifyYTiframeseektime('4274')">1:11:14</a> the minds of the people to become very  
<a onclick="modifyYTiframeseektime('4275')">1:11:15</a> messed up yeah  
<a onclick="modifyYTiframeseektime('4277')">1:11:17</a> and also i mean some people can take  
<a onclick="modifyYTiframeseektime('4280')">1:11:20</a> what you say  
<a onclick="modifyYTiframeseektime('4281')">1:11:21</a> and distort it but once again of course  
<a onclick="modifyYTiframeseektime('4283')">1:11:23</a> you can't just always shut up every type  
<a onclick="modifyYTiframeseektime('4285')">1:11:25</a> of  
<a onclick="modifyYTiframeseektime('4286')">1:11:26</a> enemy that comes at you but the most you  
<a onclick="modifyYTiframeseektime('4288')">1:11:28</a> can do is just kind of like  
<a onclick="modifyYTiframeseektime('4290')">1:11:30</a> but what i want the muslims to realize  
<a onclick="modifyYTiframeseektime('4291')">1:11:31</a> about this right  
<a onclick="modifyYTiframeseektime('4293')">1:11:33</a> is that causing this is very important  
<a onclick="modifyYTiframeseektime('4297')">1:11:37</a> attacking yes on this point  
<a onclick="modifyYTiframeseektime('4301')">1:11:41</a> is not a good idea okay attacking him  
<a onclick="modifyYTiframeseektime('4305')">1:11:45</a> is is a fitna attacking his view that he  
<a onclick="modifyYTiframeseektime('4308')">1:11:48</a> hasn't even publicized is a fitna  
<a onclick="modifyYTiframeseektime('4310')">1:11:50</a> because it will make them reaffirm  
<a onclick="modifyYTiframeseektime('4313')">1:11:53</a> their narratives or he's talking about  
<a onclick="modifyYTiframeseektime('4315')">1:11:55</a> preservation not once that he mentioned  
<a onclick="modifyYTiframeseektime('4317')">1:11:57</a> present by the way the word preservation  
<a onclick="modifyYTiframeseektime('4319')">1:11:59</a> i don't think once he mentioned he was  
<a onclick="modifyYTiframeseektime('4320')">1:12:00</a> talking about that's what he was talking  
<a onclick="modifyYTiframeseektime('4322')">1:12:02</a> about  
<a onclick="modifyYTiframeseektime('4322')">1:12:02</a> so and they they've marketed it as  
<a onclick="modifyYTiframeseektime('4324')">1:12:04</a> preservation of quran which is different  
<a onclick="modifyYTiframeseektime('4327')">1:12:07</a> and what i want the muslims to realize  
<a onclick="modifyYTiframeseektime('4328')">1:12:08</a> is that okay if he comes out with a bath  
<a onclick="modifyYTiframeseektime('4330')">1:12:10</a> with a research which is against the  
<a onclick="modifyYTiframeseektime('4331')">1:12:11</a> quran whatever there will be majel there  
<a onclick="modifyYTiframeseektime('4334')">1:12:14</a> will be a space  
<a onclick="modifyYTiframeseektime('4335')">1:12:15</a> for refutation of that bath in an  
<a onclick="modifyYTiframeseektime('4336')">1:12:16</a> academic way  
<a onclick="modifyYTiframeseektime('4338')">1:12:18</a> if there's something that people  
<a onclick="modifyYTiframeseektime('4339')">1:12:19</a> disagree with but attacking  
<a onclick="modifyYTiframeseektime('4341')">1:12:21</a> only affirms the distorted narratives of  
<a onclick="modifyYTiframeseektime('4344')">1:12:24</a> the  
<a onclick="modifyYTiframeseektime('4345')">1:12:25</a> these christians and yeah and the quran  
<a onclick="modifyYTiframeseektime('4346')">1:12:26</a> says  
<a onclick="modifyYTiframeseektime('4349')">1:12:29</a> you know this is very important when  
<a onclick="modifyYTiframeseektime('4350')">1:12:30</a> harun came back uh samus came back  
<a onclick="modifyYTiframeseektime('4353')">1:12:33</a> and harun was there  
<a onclick="modifyYTiframeseektime('4355')">1:12:35</a> [Music]

<a onclick="modifyYTiframeseektime('4363')">1:12:43</a> open for me right in a sense  
<a onclick="modifyYTiframeseektime('4364')">1:12:44</a> because you think about it the way he's

<a onclick="modifyYTiframeseektime('4371')">1:12:51</a> seen as the  
<a onclick="modifyYTiframeseektime('4372')">1:12:52</a> one of the leading figures in the west  
<a onclick="modifyYTiframeseektime('4374')">1:12:54</a> right if you make him look like  
<a onclick="modifyYTiframeseektime('4376')">1:12:56</a> that he has got doubts about the quran  
<a onclick="modifyYTiframeseektime('4379')">1:12:59</a> yeah why would you okay  
<a onclick="modifyYTiframeseektime('4380')">1:13:00</a> yeah is going to just come down like  
<a onclick="modifyYTiframeseektime('4388')">1:13:08</a> is strongly connected to right in many  
<a onclick="modifyYTiframeseektime('4390')">1:13:10</a> different parts of the world right  
<a onclick="modifyYTiframeseektime('4392')">1:13:12</a> right if tomorrow and may allah is  
<a onclick="modifyYTiframeseektime('4395')">1:13:15</a> saving from this  
<a onclick="modifyYTiframeseektime('4396')">1:13:16</a> starts having doubts somehow imagine the  
<a onclick="modifyYTiframeseektime('4398')">1:13:18</a> repercussion he would have  
<a onclick="modifyYTiframeseektime('4399')">1:13:19</a> yeah i'm not saying he's on the same  
<a onclick="modifyYTiframeseektime('4400')">1:13:20</a> level or even he has that kind of impact  
<a onclick="modifyYTiframeseektime('4403')">1:13:23</a> that he has in the west but imagine that  
<a onclick="modifyYTiframeseektime('4406')">1:13:26</a> repercussion that will happen  
<a onclick="modifyYTiframeseektime('4407')">1:13:27</a> exactly yeah you see what i'm saying so  
<a onclick="modifyYTiframeseektime('4408')">1:13:28</a> i think that we have to be very careful  
<a onclick="modifyYTiframeseektime('4410')">1:13:30</a> with these missiles  
<a onclick="modifyYTiframeseektime('4411')">1:13:31</a> and i think that people from all sides  
<a onclick="modifyYTiframeseektime('4413')">1:13:33</a> the quran is something which unifies  
<a onclick="modifyYTiframeseektime('4414')">1:13:34</a> jamie sorry  
<a onclick="modifyYTiframeseektime('4420')">1:13:40</a> right here and they take the ayah i'm  
<a onclick="modifyYTiframeseektime('4423')">1:13:43</a> talking about the fork of islam  
<a onclick="modifyYTiframeseektime('4424')">1:13:44</a> not the ones  
<a onclick="modifyYTiframeseektime('4439')">1:13:59</a> this is the quran that we are much more  
<a onclick="modifyYTiframeseektime('4440')">1:14:00</a> ali we have  
<a onclick="modifyYTiframeseektime('4442')">1:14:02</a> ishmael so this if we if we're talking  
<a onclick="modifyYTiframeseektime('4445')">1:14:05</a> about something which everybody  
<a onclick="modifyYTiframeseektime('4447')">1:14:07</a> all of the people ashari athari um  
<a onclick="modifyYTiframeseektime('4452')">1:14:12</a> all of them all of these have agreed  
<a onclick="modifyYTiframeseektime('4453')">1:14:13</a> upon what the quran is  
<a onclick="modifyYTiframeseektime('4456')">1:14:16</a> from the beginning to the end of the  
<a onclick="modifyYTiframeseektime('4457')">1:14:17</a> book so  
<a onclick="modifyYTiframeseektime('4459')">1:14:19</a> now these individuals want to make this  
<a onclick="modifyYTiframeseektime('4461')">1:14:21</a> very important they want to make it seem  
<a onclick="modifyYTiframeseektime('4462')">1:14:22</a> as if there's  
<a onclick="modifyYTiframeseektime('4465')">1:14:25</a> a quran what is the quran we can't allow  
<a onclick="modifyYTiframeseektime('4468')">1:14:28</a> them  
<a onclick="modifyYTiframeseektime('4468')">1:14:28</a> because for a thousand foundries there's  
<a onclick="modifyYTiframeseektime('4469')">1:14:29</a> no khilafana we know what the  
<a onclick="modifyYTiframeseektime('4472')">1:14:32</a> yeah we know what the we know what the  
<a onclick="modifyYTiframeseektime('4475')">1:14:35</a> we don't know exactly what a specific  
<a onclick="modifyYTiframeseektime('4476')">1:14:36</a> notion  
<a onclick="modifyYTiframeseektime('4476')">1:14:36</a> but we know what the the idea is  
<a onclick="modifyYTiframeseektime('4478')">1:14:38</a> variation yeah  
<a onclick="modifyYTiframeseektime('4480')">1:14:40</a> we know all of these things and so to  
<a onclick="modifyYTiframeseektime('4482')">1:14:42</a> for them to to to  
<a onclick="modifyYTiframeseektime('4483')">1:14:43</a> to come in and and speak in that manner  
<a onclick="modifyYTiframeseektime('4485')">1:14:45</a> we cannot allow that  
<a onclick="modifyYTiframeseektime('4487')">1:14:47</a> uh and then using one of the dua to  
<a onclick="modifyYTiframeseektime('4489')">1:14:49</a> whatever we say  
<a onclick="modifyYTiframeseektime('4491')">1:14:51</a> yes his status in the west  
<a onclick="modifyYTiframeseektime('4494')">1:14:54</a> especially on academic level is is very  
<a onclick="modifyYTiframeseektime('4497')">1:14:57</a> high  
<a onclick="modifyYTiframeseektime('4498')">1:14:58</a> so so in terms of influence whatever  
<a onclick="modifyYTiframeseektime('4499')">1:14:59</a> your view on quality is or  
<a onclick="modifyYTiframeseektime('4501')">1:15:01</a> or yes whatever your view on him is  
<a onclick="modifyYTiframeseektime('4504')">1:15:04</a> he's still listed in if you like the 500  
<a onclick="modifyYTiframeseektime('4507')">1:15:07</a> most influential muslims in the world  
<a onclick="modifyYTiframeseektime('4508')">1:15:08</a> he's still got he's done what he's done  
<a onclick="modifyYTiframeseektime('4510')">1:15:10</a> so it doesn't make sense to have a harsh  
<a onclick="modifyYTiframeseektime('4512')">1:15:12</a> approach with him and to count a  
<a onclick="modifyYTiframeseektime('4514')">1:15:14</a> cancelling approach to him and  
<a onclick="modifyYTiframeseektime('4515')">1:15:15</a> it doesn't work like this we have to  
<a onclick="modifyYTiframeseektime('4516')">1:15:16</a> have a nuanced approach and wait for the  
<a onclick="modifyYTiframeseektime('4518')">1:15:18</a> publications  
<a onclick="modifyYTiframeseektime('4519')">1:15:19</a> and and then deal with accordingly i  
<a onclick="modifyYTiframeseektime('4521')">1:15:21</a> think this is what we need to do  
<a onclick="modifyYTiframeseektime('4522')">1:15:22</a> would you agree with this yeah of course  
<a onclick="modifyYTiframeseektime('4524')">1:15:24</a> yeah so if he basically came out like  
<a onclick="modifyYTiframeseektime('4526')">1:15:26</a> i'm just asking you this right if he  
<a onclick="modifyYTiframeseektime('4528')">1:15:28</a> came out and  
<a onclick="modifyYTiframeseektime('4529')">1:15:29</a> some of the things had you know uh  
<a onclick="modifyYTiframeseektime('4531')">1:15:31</a> problematic things inside of it  
<a onclick="modifyYTiframeseektime('4533')">1:15:33</a> yeah um you wouldn't have a problem just  
<a onclick="modifyYTiframeseektime('4535')">1:15:35</a> coming out just literally  
<a onclick="modifyYTiframeseektime('4537')">1:15:37</a> i would have i would have a problem  
<a onclick="modifyYTiframeseektime('4539')">1:15:39</a> refuting what that is that he's saying  
<a onclick="modifyYTiframeseektime('4541')">1:15:41</a> you know what i'm saying i'm not me  
<a onclick="modifyYTiframeseektime('4542')">1:15:42</a> personally do a knuckle of those who  
<a onclick="modifyYTiframeseektime('4544')">1:15:44</a> have said like if i if i disagree with  
<a onclick="modifyYTiframeseektime('4546')">1:15:46</a> dr i'll tell him directly i'll say  
<a onclick="modifyYTiframeseektime('4547')">1:15:47</a> listen this this doesn't make sense what  
<a onclick="modifyYTiframeseektime('4549')">1:15:49</a> you're saying oh this doesn't make sense  
<a onclick="modifyYTiframeseektime('4550')">1:15:50</a> what you're saying  
<a onclick="modifyYTiframeseektime('4551')">1:15:51</a> i have no problem with that another  
<a onclick="modifyYTiframeseektime('4552')">1:15:52</a> question i want to ask you is about  
<a onclick="modifyYTiframeseektime('4554')">1:15:54</a> this kind of cancer culture people  
<a onclick="modifyYTiframeseektime('4557')">1:15:57</a> cancelling people out because of  
<a onclick="modifyYTiframeseektime('4558')">1:15:58</a> association guilty by association  
<a onclick="modifyYTiframeseektime('4561')">1:16:01</a> so they do a tab dia maybe from their  
<a onclick="modifyYTiframeseektime('4563')">1:16:03</a> own volition without the consultation of  
<a onclick="modifyYTiframeseektime('4565')">1:16:05</a> the scholar  
<a onclick="modifyYTiframeseektime('4565')">1:16:05</a> and then they'll say whoever's  
<a onclick="modifyYTiframeseektime('4567')">1:16:07</a> associated with this person who's  
<a onclick="modifyYTiframeseektime('4569')">1:16:09</a> themselves as an innovator and this just  
<a onclick="modifyYTiframeseektime('4572')">1:16:12</a> causes division like unnecessary  
<a onclick="modifyYTiframeseektime('4574')">1:16:14</a> division  
<a onclick="modifyYTiframeseektime('4574')">1:16:14</a> and it's untenable in the ummah having  
<a onclick="modifyYTiframeseektime('4577')">1:16:17</a> said this now  
<a onclick="modifyYTiframeseektime('4578')">1:16:18</a> what is your stance on this if for  
<a onclick="modifyYTiframeseektime('4580')">1:16:20</a> example i would if you were to see  
<a onclick="modifyYTiframeseektime('4582')">1:16:22</a> uh if i were to see you could i see you  
<a onclick="modifyYTiframeseektime('4583')">1:16:23</a> in in a mosque which is potentially like  
<a onclick="modifyYTiframeseektime('4586')">1:16:26</a> a diobandy mosque  
<a onclick="modifyYTiframeseektime('4587')">1:16:27</a> or even uh brelvi mosque or something  
<a onclick="modifyYTiframeseektime('4591')">1:16:31</a> do you see an issue with  
<a onclick="modifyYTiframeseektime('4594')">1:16:34</a> um doing higher doing good in places  
<a onclick="modifyYTiframeseektime('4597')">1:16:37</a> spaces which are not especially or  
<a onclick="modifyYTiframeseektime('4599')">1:16:39</a> specifically selfie spaces  
<a onclick="modifyYTiframeseektime('4601')">1:16:41</a> or do you think that there's a more  
<a onclick="modifyYTiframeseektime('4602')">1:16:42</a> sophisticated approach to this i think  
<a onclick="modifyYTiframeseektime('4604')">1:16:44</a> this question can be  
<a onclick="modifyYTiframeseektime('4605')">1:16:45</a> maybe uh answered in two parts right the  
<a onclick="modifyYTiframeseektime('4608')">1:16:48</a> first part is  
<a onclick="modifyYTiframeseektime('4610')">1:16:50</a> um going to the masajid  
<a onclick="modifyYTiframeseektime('4614')">1:16:54</a> of those individuals who might not  
<a onclick="modifyYTiframeseektime('4616')">1:16:56</a> supposedly be upon the sunnah right  
<a onclick="modifyYTiframeseektime('4619')">1:16:59</a> i wrote an article in 2015  
<a onclick="modifyYTiframeseektime('4623')">1:17:03</a> okay and i gave you the worst title  
<a onclick="modifyYTiframeseektime('4626')">1:17:06</a> possible  
<a onclick="modifyYTiframeseektime('4627')">1:17:07</a> the permissibility of going to the

<a onclick="modifyYTiframeseektime('4633')">1:17:13</a> what was happening at the time was  
<a onclick="modifyYTiframeseektime('4636')">1:17:16</a> there was this group of people who were

<a onclick="modifyYTiframeseektime('4657')">1:17:37</a> so the moment a brother goes there pdfs

<a onclick="modifyYTiframeseektime('4706')">1:18:26</a> pdf we had the likes of uh  
<a onclick="modifyYTiframeseektime('4710')">1:18:30</a> saying that's even permissible to go  
<a onclick="modifyYTiframeseektime('4712')">1:18:32</a> into a church and give the hour there  
<a onclick="modifyYTiframeseektime('4714')">1:18:34</a> and you also had uh uh

<a onclick="modifyYTiframeseektime('4730')">1:18:50</a> saw affect  
<a onclick="modifyYTiframeseektime('4736')">1:18:56</a> he had a similar effect with this and so  
<a onclick="modifyYTiframeseektime('4738')">1:18:58</a> many other scholars i try to keep it as

<a onclick="modifyYTiframeseektime('4814')">1:20:14</a> because i'm only by myself so the sheikh  
<a onclick="modifyYTiframeseektime('4817')">1:20:17</a> would go  
<a onclick="modifyYTiframeseektime('4818')">1:20:18</a> out to their marketplaces he would be  
<a onclick="modifyYTiframeseektime('4819')">1:20:19</a> giving dawa to them  
<a onclick="modifyYTiframeseektime('4821')">1:20:21</a> so much so that what happened many  
<a onclick="modifyYTiframeseektime('4823')">1:20:23</a> people started becoming sunnis  
<a onclick="modifyYTiframeseektime('4826')">1:20:26</a> and the congregation started increasing  
<a onclick="modifyYTiframeseektime('4828')">1:20:28</a> but the share would be going out to them  
<a onclick="modifyYTiframeseektime('4831')">1:20:31</a> even my own shaykh abdul hamid he used  
<a onclick="modifyYTiframeseektime('4834')">1:20:34</a> to specifically this is like  
<a onclick="modifyYTiframeseektime('4836')">1:20:36</a> maybe in the last 20 years he used to go  
<a onclick="modifyYTiframeseektime('4839')">1:20:39</a> out to the masajid of the shia and he  
<a onclick="modifyYTiframeseektime('4842')">1:20:42</a> would speak about the virtues of alibaba  
<a onclick="modifyYTiframeseektime('4846')">1:20:46</a> he's got nothing to do with shiaism  
<a onclick="modifyYTiframeseektime('4848')">1:20:48</a> right he would grab the mic and as soon  
<a onclick="modifyYTiframeseektime('4851')">1:20:51</a> as he grabs the mic you can see the  
<a onclick="modifyYTiframeseektime('4852')">1:20:52</a> congregation getting worked out they  
<a onclick="modifyYTiframeseektime('4853')">1:20:53</a> want to do something to him  
<a onclick="modifyYTiframeseektime('4855')">1:20:55</a> he will say the reminder inshallah will  
<a onclick="modifyYTiframeseektime('4857')">1:20:57</a> be after the sunnah prayer  
<a onclick="modifyYTiframeseektime('4859')">1:20:59</a> on the virtues of every time they would  
<a onclick="modifyYTiframeseektime('4860')">1:21:00</a> cool down a bit i heard this in my own  
<a onclick="modifyYTiframeseektime('4862')">1:21:02</a> ears  
<a onclick="modifyYTiframeseektime('4865')">1:21:05</a> and he would then start speaking about  
<a onclick="modifyYTiframeseektime('4866')">1:21:06</a> the virtues  
<a onclick="modifyYTiframeseektime('4872')">1:21:12</a> whoever  
<a onclick="modifyYTiframeseektime('4884')">1:21:24</a> so he's propagating the sunnah while at  
<a onclick="modifyYTiframeseektime('4888')">1:21:28</a> the same time he's using ali namit  
<a onclick="modifyYTiframeseektime('4890')">1:21:30</a> to speak about the issue they are  
<a onclick="modifyYTiframeseektime('4891')">1:21:31</a> involved in you see what i'm saying  
<a onclick="modifyYTiframeseektime('4894')">1:21:34</a> so so much hair came out of it they they  
<a onclick="modifyYTiframeseektime('4896')">1:21:36</a> even said if this is a  
<a onclick="modifyYTiframeseektime('4897')">1:21:37</a> sunnah then anytime come you know  
<a onclick="modifyYTiframeseektime('4902')">1:21:42</a> so um like ahi this is i don't want to  
<a onclick="modifyYTiframeseektime('4904')">1:21:44</a> say unanimous agreement from the  
<a onclick="modifyYTiframeseektime('4906')">1:21:46</a> scholars  
<a onclick="modifyYTiframeseektime('4907')">1:21:47</a> um but there is so many statements so  
<a onclick="modifyYTiframeseektime('4910')">1:21:50</a> many statements  
<a onclick="modifyYTiframeseektime('4911')">1:21:51</a> from the scholars saying so the idea  
<a onclick="modifyYTiframeseektime('4913')">1:21:53</a> that we can even put the  
<a onclick="modifyYTiframeseektime('4914')">1:21:54</a> article under the video right yeah i  
<a onclick="modifyYTiframeseektime('4917')">1:21:57</a> wrote this you're saying  
<a onclick="modifyYTiframeseektime('4918')">1:21:58</a> you're saying that you're talking about  
<a onclick="modifyYTiframeseektime('4921')">1:22:01</a> um  
<a onclick="modifyYTiframeseektime('4922')">1:22:02</a> people being associated with people of  
<a onclick="modifyYTiframeseektime('4925')">1:22:05</a> different  
<a onclick="modifyYTiframeseektime('4926')">1:22:06</a> understandings him going there giving a  
<a onclick="modifyYTiframeseektime('4928')">1:22:08</a> lecture  
<a onclick="modifyYTiframeseektime('4929')">1:22:09</a> propagating whatever he needs to  
<a onclick="modifyYTiframeseektime('4930')">1:22:10</a> propagate and i'm not talking about  
<a onclick="modifyYTiframeseektime('4931')">1:22:11</a> compromising  
<a onclick="modifyYTiframeseektime('4932')">1:22:12</a> you know sometimes what happens the  
<a onclick="modifyYTiframeseektime('4933')">1:22:13</a> person comes and he's compromising the  
<a onclick="modifyYTiframeseektime('4936')">1:22:16</a> innovation he might even go as far as  
<a onclick="modifyYTiframeseektime('4938')">1:22:18</a> like acting like it's perfectly fine so  
<a onclick="modifyYTiframeseektime('4940')">1:22:20</a> it's like talent  
<a onclick="modifyYTiframeseektime('4942')">1:22:22</a> okay when  
<a onclick="modifyYTiframeseektime('4957')">1:22:37</a> uh and i always mention this right that  
<a onclick="modifyYTiframeseektime('4960')">1:22:40</a> cooperation can be in a  
<a onclick="modifyYTiframeseektime('4963')">1:22:43</a> way where sometimes the government  
<a onclick="modifyYTiframeseektime('4967')">1:22:47</a> they need everybody to come over from  
<a onclick="modifyYTiframeseektime('4968')">1:22:48</a> different groups  
<a onclick="modifyYTiframeseektime('4970')">1:22:50</a> they've got issues related to the  
<a onclick="modifyYTiframeseektime('4972')">1:22:52</a> massage they need signatures  
<a onclick="modifyYTiframeseektime('4974')">1:22:54</a> okay this is now a form of cooperation  
<a onclick="modifyYTiframeseektime('4976')">1:22:56</a> of course  
<a onclick="modifyYTiframeseektime('4978')">1:22:58</a> you're not compromising you're not  
<a onclick="modifyYTiframeseektime('4979')">1:22:59</a> compromising your religion you're going  
<a onclick="modifyYTiframeseektime('4980')">1:23:00</a> because  
<a onclick="modifyYTiframeseektime('4981')">1:23:01</a> that person you're not mixing exactly  
<a onclick="modifyYTiframeseektime('4984')">1:23:04</a> right  
<a onclick="modifyYTiframeseektime('4984')">1:23:04</a> that person who works in the government  
<a onclick="modifyYTiframeseektime('4987')">1:23:07</a> he looks at all of you guys and you guys  
<a onclick="modifyYTiframeseektime('4989')">1:23:09</a> are the same he don't care  
<a onclick="modifyYTiframeseektime('4991')">1:23:11</a> huh and um all you guys are coming  
<a onclick="modifyYTiframeseektime('4994')">1:23:14</a> together  
<a onclick="modifyYTiframeseektime('4995')">1:23:15</a> you guys need to attend that meeting you  
<a onclick="modifyYTiframeseektime('4997')">1:23:17</a> need to sign  
<a onclick="modifyYTiframeseektime('4998')">1:23:18</a> whatever paper you guys need to sign and  
<a onclick="modifyYTiframeseektime('5000')">1:23:20</a> you have to show a united front  
<a onclick="modifyYTiframeseektime('5002')">1:23:22</a> on that issue so that's one form of  
<a onclick="modifyYTiframeseektime('5006')">1:23:26</a> tower  
<a onclick="modifyYTiframeseektime('5007')">1:23:27</a> and there is nothing wrong with that  
<a onclick="modifyYTiframeseektime('5008')">1:23:28</a> because there is a bigger  
<a onclick="modifyYTiframeseektime('5010')">1:23:30</a> facet at stake here of course imagine  
<a onclick="modifyYTiframeseektime('5012')">1:23:32</a> all the massages if you don't come to  
<a onclick="modifyYTiframeseektime('5014')">1:23:34</a> this meaning all the messiah gonna be  
<a onclick="modifyYTiframeseektime('5015')">1:23:35</a> closed down  
<a onclick="modifyYTiframeseektime('5016')">1:23:36</a> or there's issues related to hijab or  
<a onclick="modifyYTiframeseektime('5018')">1:23:38</a> whatever have you  
<a onclick="modifyYTiframeseektime('5019')">1:23:39</a> and what's being taught in the schools  
<a onclick="modifyYTiframeseektime('5020')">1:23:40</a> to our youngsters you're gonna attend  
<a onclick="modifyYTiframeseektime('5022')">1:23:42</a> right i've attended that in the past as  
<a onclick="modifyYTiframeseektime('5024')">1:23:44</a> well yeah but then you have  
<a onclick="modifyYTiframeseektime('5026')">1:23:46</a> cooperation on a dower level is this  
<a onclick="modifyYTiframeseektime('5028')">1:23:48</a> possible muhammad  
<a onclick="modifyYTiframeseektime('5030')">1:23:50</a> let's be fair here right i'm calling to  
<a onclick="modifyYTiframeseektime('5032')">1:23:52</a> talk i'm calling to the sunnah  
<a onclick="modifyYTiframeseektime('5034')">1:23:54</a> and you've got a guy next to me sitting  
<a onclick="modifyYTiframeseektime('5036')">1:23:56</a> on the same panel he's calling to bid  
<a onclick="modifyYTiframeseektime('5038')">1:23:58</a> and he's calling to it's okay for you  
<a onclick="modifyYTiframeseektime('5040')">1:24:00</a> not to call on to the messenger  
<a onclick="modifyYTiframeseektime('5042')">1:24:02</a> when you visit his grave when you go to  
<a onclick="modifyYTiframeseektime('5043')">1:24:03</a> medina  
<a onclick="modifyYTiframeseektime('5046')">1:24:06</a> these are two opposites that um they  
<a onclick="modifyYTiframeseektime('5049')">1:24:09</a> just don't come together right  
<a onclick="modifyYTiframeseektime('5051')">1:24:11</a> and this kind of cooperation of course  
<a onclick="modifyYTiframeseektime('5053')">1:24:13</a> is battle this is now  
<a onclick="modifyYTiframeseektime('5055')">1:24:15</a> look next thing with i'll tell you a  
<a onclick="modifyYTiframeseektime('5057')">1:24:17</a> story okay  
<a onclick="modifyYTiframeseektime('5058')">1:24:18</a> of my own self um when i was doing  
<a onclick="modifyYTiframeseektime('5062')">1:24:22</a> some postgraduate research in uh  
<a onclick="modifyYTiframeseektime('5065')">1:24:25</a> so as university okay and there was one  
<a onclick="modifyYTiframeseektime('5069')">1:24:29</a> lecturer that i had who was who was  
<a onclick="modifyYTiframeseektime('5072')">1:24:32</a> lecturing you yeah he's appear he's a  
<a onclick="modifyYTiframeseektime('5073')">1:24:33</a> phd holder and  
<a onclick="modifyYTiframeseektime('5074')">1:24:34</a> i'm not going to mention his name well  
<a onclick="modifyYTiframeseektime('5076')">1:24:36</a> he's basically  
<a onclick="modifyYTiframeseektime('5078')">1:24:38</a> in my opinion as in dick okay i know  
<a onclick="modifyYTiframeseektime('5080')">1:24:40</a> that's a very harsh statement to make  
<a onclick="modifyYTiframeseektime('5081')">1:24:41</a> but he's basically  
<a onclick="modifyYTiframeseektime('5084')">1:24:44</a> any no explain to people he's a heretic  
<a onclick="modifyYTiframeseektime('5087')">1:24:47</a> yeah yeah it's something that takes you  
<a onclick="modifyYTiframeseektime('5090')">1:24:50</a> out of the face  
<a onclick="modifyYTiframeseektime('5091')">1:24:51</a> of islam okay so he was spouting that on  
<a onclick="modifyYTiframeseektime('5093')">1:24:53</a> a daily basis okay  
<a onclick="modifyYTiframeseektime('5095')">1:24:55</a> and he was just disguising him in  
<a onclick="modifyYTiframeseektime('5098')">1:24:58</a> islamic jogging and stuff like that  
<a onclick="modifyYTiframeseektime('5099')">1:24:59</a> was he like a non-muslim or was he like  
<a onclick="modifyYTiframeseektime('5101')">1:25:01</a> a muslim he was a muslim name  
<a onclick="modifyYTiframeseektime('5102')">1:25:02</a> he claimed to islam he has an appearance  
<a onclick="modifyYTiframeseektime('5106')">1:25:06</a> okay now remember the cluster we were in  
<a onclick="modifyYTiframeseektime('5109')">1:25:09</a> was can was a mix of muslims and  
<a onclick="modifyYTiframeseektime('5112')">1:25:12</a> non-muslims  
<a onclick="modifyYTiframeseektime('5113')">1:25:13</a> so there's this is a dao thing right in  
<a onclick="modifyYTiframeseektime('5115')">1:25:15</a> a sense because when he's now making  
<a onclick="modifyYTiframeseektime('5118')">1:25:18</a> that all the muslims agree upon okay  
<a onclick="modifyYTiframeseektime('5121')">1:25:21</a> it's upon us the people in the class who  
<a onclick="modifyYTiframeseektime('5124')">1:25:24</a> were a mix they were selfies in the  
<a onclick="modifyYTiframeseektime('5126')">1:25:26</a> class there were dear band in their  
<a onclick="modifyYTiframeseektime('5127')">1:25:27</a> class and they were braves in the class  
<a onclick="modifyYTiframeseektime('5129')">1:25:29</a> yeah all three were in that class it's  
<a onclick="modifyYTiframeseektime('5131')">1:25:31</a> upon us  
<a onclick="modifyYTiframeseektime('5132')">1:25:32</a> to show united front so that the  
<a onclick="modifyYTiframeseektime('5134')">1:25:34</a> non-muslims can see this is something  
<a onclick="modifyYTiframeseektime('5136')">1:25:36</a> outside of anything that any muslim has  
<a onclick="modifyYTiframeseektime('5137')">1:25:37</a> ever said does that make sense  
<a onclick="modifyYTiframeseektime('5139')">1:25:39</a> so clearly um in that situation it's a  
<a onclick="modifyYTiframeseektime('5143')">1:25:43</a> kind of town  
<a onclick="modifyYTiframeseektime('5144')">1:25:44</a> it was mutual it wasn't even something  
<a onclick="modifyYTiframeseektime('5146')">1:25:46</a> which we all came together and said  
<a onclick="modifyYTiframeseektime('5148')">1:25:48</a> let's sign a document of town or  
<a onclick="modifyYTiframeseektime('5149')">1:25:49</a> something like that but it was just that  
<a onclick="modifyYTiframeseektime('5151')">1:25:51</a> yeah i agree with what he's saying here  
<a onclick="modifyYTiframeseektime('5153')">1:25:53</a> yeah i agree with  
<a onclick="modifyYTiframeseektime('5154')">1:25:54</a> and this is a kind of town okay in a  
<a onclick="modifyYTiframeseektime('5156')">1:25:56</a> sense and  
<a onclick="modifyYTiframeseektime('5158')">1:25:58</a> what i'm trying to say is that it's  
<a onclick="modifyYTiframeseektime('5159')">1:25:59</a> always contextual that the person who is  
<a onclick="modifyYTiframeseektime('5161')">1:26:01</a> brotherhood might believe in this  
<a onclick="modifyYTiframeseektime('5163')">1:26:03</a> yeah he might believe in this it's just  
<a onclick="modifyYTiframeseektime('5164')">1:26:04</a> like a sultan and many of the big  
<a onclick="modifyYTiframeseektime('5166')">1:26:06</a> scholars did right and they had to  
<a onclick="modifyYTiframeseektime('5167')">1:26:07</a> will for us  
<a onclick="modifyYTiframeseektime('5175')">1:26:15</a> and no one's kicking them but when you  
<a onclick="modifyYTiframeseektime('5176')">1:26:16</a> say muhammad is not always what you call  
<a onclick="modifyYTiframeseektime('5178')">1:26:18</a> it  
<a onclick="modifyYTiframeseektime('5198')">1:26:38</a> many of the big scholars of islam  
<a onclick="modifyYTiframeseektime('5199')">1:26:39</a> because no one's taking the sukky of  
<a onclick="modifyYTiframeseektime('5201')">1:26:41</a> the fault of islam he's written big  
<a onclick="modifyYTiframeseektime('5204')">1:26:44</a> uh usually attracts and so on well i'm  
<a onclick="modifyYTiframeseektime('5207')">1:26:47</a> saying well i'm not trying to say that  
<a onclick="modifyYTiframeseektime('5208')">1:26:48</a> let's  
<a onclick="modifyYTiframeseektime('5209')">1:26:49</a> let's mix that right yeah but what i'm  
<a onclick="modifyYTiframeseektime('5210')">1:26:50</a> saying is that that's yak there  
<a onclick="modifyYTiframeseektime('5212')">1:26:52</a> it was mutually understood by almost  
<a onclick="modifyYTiframeseektime('5214')">1:26:54</a> everybody in that class  
<a onclick="modifyYTiframeseektime('5216')">1:26:56</a> just just unfortunately  
<a onclick="modifyYTiframeseektime('5219')">1:26:59</a> that we need to back each other on these  
<a onclick="modifyYTiframeseektime('5221')">1:27:01</a> because this huju mat  
<a onclick="modifyYTiframeseektime('5223')">1:27:03</a> are bigger than this it's actually  
<a onclick="modifyYTiframeseektime('5226')">1:27:06</a> bigger because  
<a onclick="modifyYTiframeseektime('5226')">1:27:06</a> you're putting it into the quran and to  
<a onclick="modifyYTiframeseektime('5228')">1:27:08</a> complete this repeat you put in the  
<a onclick="modifyYTiframeseektime('5229')">1:27:09</a> the prophet was being in question all of  
<a onclick="modifyYTiframeseektime('5233')">1:27:13</a> these things  
<a onclick="modifyYTiframeseektime('5234')">1:27:14</a> this is it's a battle between a man and  
<a onclick="modifyYTiframeseektime('5236')">1:27:16</a> kufr like in the clearest and  
<a onclick="modifyYTiframeseektime('5238')">1:27:18</a> non wheelie sense the people the  
<a onclick="modifyYTiframeseektime('5240')">1:27:20</a> brothers and uh  
<a onclick="modifyYTiframeseektime('5242')">1:27:22</a> and sisters because they are muslims  
<a onclick="modifyYTiframeseektime('5243')">1:27:23</a> that they argue for is from the  
<a onclick="modifyYTiframeseektime('5245')">1:27:25</a> background or for whatever polemically  
<a onclick="modifyYTiframeseektime('5247')">1:27:27</a> they do so within the paradigm and this  
<a onclick="modifyYTiframeseektime('5249')">1:27:29</a> is very important  
<a onclick="modifyYTiframeseektime('5251')">1:27:31</a> i'm not saying it's justified well we  
<a onclick="modifyYTiframeseektime('5252')">1:27:32</a> agree of course  
<a onclick="modifyYTiframeseektime('5254')">1:27:34</a> but what i'm saying is that they still  
<a onclick="modifyYTiframeseektime('5256')">1:27:36</a> cling to hadith and they still work  
<a onclick="modifyYTiframeseektime('5257')">1:27:37</a> there  
<a onclick="modifyYTiframeseektime('5258')">1:27:38</a> they still took quran sunnah you get it  
<a onclick="modifyYTiframeseektime('5259')">1:27:39</a> they still they have the paradigm  
<a onclick="modifyYTiframeseektime('5261')">1:27:41</a> these people yeah the same right in a  
<a onclick="modifyYTiframeseektime('5266')">1:27:46</a> sense  
<a onclick="modifyYTiframeseektime('5266')">1:27:46</a> you could argue that before i think  
<a onclick="modifyYTiframeseektime('5268')">1:27:48</a> people might not understand that word  
<a onclick="modifyYTiframeseektime('5270')">1:27:50</a> you know maybe a reference  
<a onclick="modifyYTiframeseektime('5271')">1:27:51</a> so so we take our religion from the  
<a onclick="modifyYTiframeseektime('5272')">1:27:52</a> sexual references all the same  
<a onclick="modifyYTiframeseektime('5274')">1:27:54</a> whereas the progressives and this also  
<a onclick="modifyYTiframeseektime('5277')">1:27:57</a> progressive muslims as a whole  
<a onclick="modifyYTiframeseektime('5279')">1:27:59</a> like i can even mention them by name and  
<a onclick="modifyYTiframeseektime('5281')">1:28:01</a> naimy i think his name is  
<a onclick="modifyYTiframeseektime('5282')">1:28:02</a> um amino dude and these individuals  
<a onclick="modifyYTiframeseektime('5285')">1:28:05</a> they've left the paradigm  
<a onclick="modifyYTiframeseektime('5286')">1:28:06</a> okay and this is in these spaces and  
<a onclick="modifyYTiframeseektime('5289')">1:28:09</a> this is a space that i think many people  
<a onclick="modifyYTiframeseektime('5290')">1:28:10</a> endow i'm not  
<a onclick="modifyYTiframeseektime('5291')">1:28:11</a> not aware of the academic space this is  
<a onclick="modifyYTiframeseektime('5293')">1:28:13</a> the battle the battle is between the  
<a onclick="modifyYTiframeseektime('5294')">1:28:14</a> progressives and the traditionalists  
<a onclick="modifyYTiframeseektime('5296')">1:28:16</a> and they put traditionalists all in one  
<a onclick="modifyYTiframeseektime('5298')">1:28:18</a> box like for us the salafis and the  
<a onclick="modifyYTiframeseektime('5299')">1:28:19</a> braves and the abandons they don't care  
<a onclick="modifyYTiframeseektime('5301')">1:28:21</a> about that  
<a onclick="modifyYTiframeseektime('5302')">1:28:22</a> because they're tackling the core of  
<a onclick="modifyYTiframeseektime('5305')">1:28:25</a> religion because the thing is what they  
<a onclick="modifyYTiframeseektime('5306')">1:28:26</a> want to change  
<a onclick="modifyYTiframeseektime('5308')">1:28:28</a> they want to change our morals do you  
<a onclick="modifyYTiframeseektime('5310')">1:28:30</a> see the point and  
<a onclick="modifyYTiframeseektime('5311')">1:28:31</a> by and large that the brelvin and the  
<a onclick="modifyYTiframeseektime('5314')">1:28:34</a> obama and the salafi all three of them  
<a onclick="modifyYTiframeseektime('5316')">1:28:36</a> have this very similar um  
<a onclick="modifyYTiframeseektime('5320')">1:28:40</a> practices they'll pray five times a day  
<a onclick="modifyYTiframeseektime('5322')">1:28:42</a> they'll wear their cab there  
<a onclick="modifyYTiframeseektime('5323')">1:28:43</a> make sure you're a bit specific because  
<a onclick="modifyYTiframeseektime('5324')">1:28:44</a> you could talk not talking about i'm not  
<a onclick="modifyYTiframeseektime('5326')">1:28:46</a> talking about stephan here but i'm  
<a onclick="modifyYTiframeseektime('5327')">1:28:47</a> talking about  
<a onclick="modifyYTiframeseektime('5328')">1:28:48</a> visible practices like a salazar  
<a onclick="modifyYTiframeseektime('5332')">1:28:52</a> yeah i've got hajj and so on yeah and  
<a onclick="modifyYTiframeseektime('5334')">1:28:54</a> even haram take this masala away of  
<a onclick="modifyYTiframeseektime('5337')">1:28:57</a> of uh which this clear disagreement no  
<a onclick="modifyYTiframeseektime('5340')">1:29:00</a> one's going to  
<a onclick="modifyYTiframeseektime('5340')">1:29:00</a> no one's going to lie about that any  
<a onclick="modifyYTiframeseektime('5341')">1:29:01</a> things that are basically above the  
<a onclick="modifyYTiframeseektime('5343')">1:29:03</a> surface that yeah  
<a onclick="modifyYTiframeseektime('5344')">1:29:04</a> like for example exactly yeah yeah so  
<a onclick="modifyYTiframeseektime('5347')">1:29:07</a> visible practices  
<a onclick="modifyYTiframeseektime('5348')">1:29:08</a> so for them i mean do you think that  
<a onclick="modifyYTiframeseektime('5350')">1:29:10</a> yani this progressive muslims or those  
<a onclick="modifyYTiframeseektime('5352')">1:29:12</a> who put them in their place who the  
<a onclick="modifyYTiframeseektime('5353')">1:29:13</a> i would call them the colonial masters  
<a onclick="modifyYTiframeseektime('5355')">1:29:15</a> they don't they don't care  
<a onclick="modifyYTiframeseektime('5357')">1:29:17</a> if you believe in this to be honest  
<a onclick="modifyYTiframeseektime('5360')">1:29:20</a> they all they want to do is they change  
<a onclick="modifyYTiframeseektime('5363')">1:29:23</a> now i'm not suggesting this is not an  
<a onclick="modifyYTiframeseektime('5364')">1:29:24</a> important topic  
<a onclick="modifyYTiframeseektime('5365')">1:29:25</a> okay i really am not suggesting i want  
<a onclick="modifyYTiframeseektime('5367')">1:29:27</a> to make this very clear i'm not  
<a onclick="modifyYTiframeseektime('5368')">1:29:28</a> suggesting that there should not be  
<a onclick="modifyYTiframeseektime('5369')">1:29:29</a> those debates and those  
<a onclick="modifyYTiframeseektime('5371')">1:29:31</a> uh refutations because we're talking  
<a onclick="modifyYTiframeseektime('5372')">1:29:32</a> about islam  
<a onclick="modifyYTiframeseektime('5374')">1:29:34</a> yeah yeah yeah someone believes so  
<a onclick="modifyYTiframeseektime('5378')">1:29:38</a> this is something which we're not  
<a onclick="modifyYTiframeseektime('5379')">1:29:39</a> compromising one at all yeah very clear  
<a onclick="modifyYTiframeseektime('5381')">1:29:41</a> yeah  
<a onclick="modifyYTiframeseektime('5381')">1:29:41</a> however we need to know which yani where  
<a onclick="modifyYTiframeseektime('5384')">1:29:44</a> to where where to position the  
<a onclick="modifyYTiframeseektime('5386')">1:29:46</a> the gun in the sense that in in in the  
<a onclick="modifyYTiframeseektime('5389')">1:29:49</a> different cases and in situations you  
<a onclick="modifyYTiframeseektime('5391')">1:29:51</a> find yourself in so  
<a onclick="modifyYTiframeseektime('5392')">1:29:52</a> in this in this case i'm talking about  
<a onclick="modifyYTiframeseektime('5393')">1:29:53</a> my specific experience here in  
<a onclick="modifyYTiframeseektime('5395')">1:29:55</a> in the universities like when they when  
<a onclick="modifyYTiframeseektime('5398')">1:29:58</a> you're  
<a onclick="modifyYTiframeseektime('5398')">1:29:58</a> questioning the existence of prophet  
<a onclick="modifyYTiframeseektime('5400')">1:30:00</a> muhammad the existence or  
<a onclick="modifyYTiframeseektime('5402')">1:30:02</a> they even existed the the quran is  
<a onclick="modifyYTiframeseektime('5406')">1:30:06</a> there and this is a combination of this  
<a onclick="modifyYTiframeseektime('5407')">1:30:07</a> and now we have to  
<a onclick="modifyYTiframeseektime('5410')">1:30:10</a> sorry but that is actually that's more  
<a onclick="modifyYTiframeseektime('5412')">1:30:12</a> of an issue we have to tackle this  
<a onclick="modifyYTiframeseektime('5413')">1:30:13</a> first because the kafir who's listening  
<a onclick="modifyYTiframeseektime('5415')">1:30:15</a> to or the muslims listening to it  
<a onclick="modifyYTiframeseektime('5417')">1:30:17</a> is going to think well why do i need to  
<a onclick="modifyYTiframeseektime('5420')">1:30:20</a> join this religion in the first place  
<a onclick="modifyYTiframeseektime('5421')">1:30:21</a> they won't even get into the discussion  
<a onclick="modifyYTiframeseektime('5423')">1:30:23</a> phase two of okay  
<a onclick="modifyYTiframeseektime('5424')">1:30:24</a> what's the hadith say about them  
<a onclick="modifyYTiframeseektime('5428')">1:30:28</a> and so on you know what i mean they  
<a onclick="modifyYTiframeseektime('5430')">1:30:30</a> don't care about that and they don't  
<a onclick="modifyYTiframeseektime('5431')">1:30:31</a> know about that because their master  
<a onclick="modifyYTiframeseektime('5432')">1:30:32</a> is completely different so we have to  
<a onclick="modifyYTiframeseektime('5433')">1:30:33</a> bring them into the fold first then have  
<a onclick="modifyYTiframeseektime('5434')">1:30:34</a> the discussions  
<a onclick="modifyYTiframeseektime('5436')">1:30:36</a> so that's why i feel like when we when  
<a onclick="modifyYTiframeseektime('5438')">1:30:38</a> we say dawah we have to be specific  
<a onclick="modifyYTiframeseektime('5439')">1:30:39</a> because  
<a onclick="modifyYTiframeseektime('5440')">1:30:40</a> it's there are forms of dawah where even  
<a onclick="modifyYTiframeseektime('5443')">1:30:43</a> like you just said like for example  
<a onclick="modifyYTiframeseektime('5446')">1:30:46</a> or um sex education in the schools do  
<a onclick="modifyYTiframeseektime('5450')">1:30:50</a> you think they'll say salafi  
<a onclick="modifyYTiframeseektime('5451')">1:30:51</a> let's come in uh something that is uh  
<a onclick="modifyYTiframeseektime('5454')">1:30:54</a> attacking the united front it does  
<a onclick="modifyYTiframeseektime('5456')">1:30:56</a> require united front and so long as  
<a onclick="modifyYTiframeseektime('5458')">1:30:58</a> someone  
<a onclick="modifyYTiframeseektime('5459')">1:30:59</a> someone who is claiming to be a muslim  
<a onclick="modifyYTiframeseektime('5461')">1:31:01</a> they can they can work together  
<a onclick="modifyYTiframeseektime('5462')">1:31:02</a> other muslims on it even shia and sunni  
<a onclick="modifyYTiframeseektime('5465')">1:31:05</a> even sunni  
<a onclick="modifyYTiframeseektime('5466')">1:31:06</a> there's some issues that that the it is  
<a onclick="modifyYTiframeseektime('5469')">1:31:09</a> for both  
<a onclick="modifyYTiframeseektime('5470')">1:31:10</a> halal me for example right in a school  
<a onclick="modifyYTiframeseektime('5472')">1:31:12</a> you work in the school for example  
<a onclick="modifyYTiframeseektime('5474')">1:31:14</a> this guy i'm not going to cooperate with  
<a onclick="modifyYTiframeseektime('5475')">1:31:15</a> him because he's a shiite and that would  
<a onclick="modifyYTiframeseektime('5477')">1:31:17</a> be  
<a onclick="modifyYTiframeseektime('5478')">1:31:18</a> foolish especially if you're a majority  
<a onclick="modifyYTiframeseektime('5480')">1:31:20</a> population and you're sunni  
<a onclick="modifyYTiframeseektime('5481')">1:31:21</a> so you're not going to join the effort  
<a onclick="modifyYTiframeseektime('5483')">1:31:23</a> of the shiite for example who wants to  
<a onclick="modifyYTiframeseektime('5484')">1:31:24</a> promote halal and me  
<a onclick="modifyYTiframeseektime('5485')">1:31:25</a> so all of this town right and what i'm  
<a onclick="modifyYTiframeseektime('5487')">1:31:27</a> trying to say but i think we we  
<a onclick="modifyYTiframeseektime('5488')">1:31:28</a> we have common grounds in what we're  
<a onclick="modifyYTiframeseektime('5490')">1:31:30</a> discussing yes that ta'awein is of  
<a onclick="modifyYTiframeseektime('5492')">1:31:32</a> different  
<a onclick="modifyYTiframeseektime('5492')">1:31:32</a> cooperating yeah and cooperation is of  
<a onclick="modifyYTiframeseektime('5495')">1:31:35</a> different levels  
<a onclick="modifyYTiframeseektime('5496')">1:31:36</a> right okay so i think one thing we need  
<a onclick="modifyYTiframeseektime('5498')">1:31:38</a> to be very careful here is  
<a onclick="modifyYTiframeseektime('5500')">1:31:40</a> uh a way which uh some of this  
<a onclick="modifyYTiframeseektime('5503')">1:31:43</a> cooperation can be done  
<a onclick="modifyYTiframeseektime('5504')">1:31:44</a> without acquiring the beliefs you know  
<a onclick="modifyYTiframeseektime('5507')">1:31:47</a> becoming mixed with one another right  
<a onclick="modifyYTiframeseektime('5509')">1:31:49</a> and then  
<a onclick="modifyYTiframeseektime('5509')">1:31:49</a> falsehood and also that which is correct  
<a onclick="modifyYTiframeseektime('5511')">1:31:51</a> becoming mixed with one another  
<a onclick="modifyYTiframeseektime('5512')">1:31:52</a> okay and also there being a level of  
<a onclick="modifyYTiframeseektime('5514')">1:31:54</a> distinction right  
<a onclick="modifyYTiframeseektime('5516')">1:31:56</a> because so you're saying there's a  
<a onclick="modifyYTiframeseektime('5517')">1:31:57</a> difference between unity in a sense  
<a onclick="modifyYTiframeseektime('5519')">1:31:59</a> and uniformity in the sense that we're  
<a onclick="modifyYTiframeseektime('5521')">1:32:01</a> not coming all together and saying okay  
<a onclick="modifyYTiframeseektime('5523')">1:32:03</a> we want to  
<a onclick="modifyYTiframeseektime('5523')">1:32:03</a> we want to basically unite we want to  
<a onclick="modifyYTiframeseektime('5524')">1:32:04</a> put akai to the south side yeah  
<a onclick="modifyYTiframeseektime('5527')">1:32:07</a> see what i'm saying that has to be used  
<a onclick="modifyYTiframeseektime('5528')">1:32:08</a> there has to be of course that's what it  
<a onclick="modifyYTiframeseektime('5529')">1:32:09</a> means how can i be calling to the son of  
<a onclick="modifyYTiframeseektime('5531')">1:32:11</a> the messiah  
<a onclick="modifyYTiframeseektime('5532')">1:32:12</a> i'm telling the people the messenger  
<a onclick="modifyYTiframeseektime('5534')">1:32:14</a> said to abdullah ibn abbas  
<a onclick="modifyYTiframeseektime('5537')">1:32:17</a> when you ask ask allah and then the guy  
<a onclick="modifyYTiframeseektime('5539')">1:32:19</a> next to me it's like a conference we're  
<a onclick="modifyYTiframeseektime('5541')">1:32:21</a> going to talk about  
<a onclick="modifyYTiframeseektime('5542')">1:32:22</a> akida i'm coming yeah  
<a onclick="modifyYTiframeseektime('5547')">1:32:27</a> yeah but of course there has to be a  
<a onclick="modifyYTiframeseektime('5548')">1:32:28</a> level of yeah we have to come together  
<a onclick="modifyYTiframeseektime('5550')">1:32:30</a> right this is happening now in the  
<a onclick="modifyYTiframeseektime('5552')">1:32:32</a> schools related to sex education what  
<a onclick="modifyYTiframeseektime('5554')">1:32:34</a> the  
<a onclick="modifyYTiframeseektime('5554')">1:32:34</a> kids are being taught and the kophara  
<a onclick="modifyYTiframeseektime('5557')">1:32:37</a> saying okay bring your issues forward  
<a onclick="modifyYTiframeseektime('5558')">1:32:38</a> this and now right and then  
<a onclick="modifyYTiframeseektime('5560')">1:32:40</a> people from different walks of life they  
<a onclick="modifyYTiframeseektime('5561')">1:32:41</a> all have to come together right and  
<a onclick="modifyYTiframeseektime('5563')">1:32:43</a> they're disgusted  
<a onclick="modifyYTiframeseektime('5566')">1:32:46</a> you see what i'm saying yeah and um  
<a onclick="modifyYTiframeseektime('5569')">1:32:49</a> yeah of course so what do you think of  
<a onclick="modifyYTiframeseektime('5572')">1:32:52</a> this  
<a onclick="modifyYTiframeseektime('5573')">1:32:53</a> this whole like you were calling it kind  
<a onclick="modifyYTiframeseektime('5574')">1:32:54</a> of this um  
<a onclick="modifyYTiframeseektime('5576')">1:32:56</a> phenomena of um  
<a onclick="modifyYTiframeseektime('5579')">1:32:59</a> okay that's the second scenario or the  
<a onclick="modifyYTiframeseektime('5581')">1:33:01</a> second part of the question right  
<a onclick="modifyYTiframeseektime('5583')">1:33:03</a> uh of guilty by association right okay  
<a onclick="modifyYTiframeseektime('5586')">1:33:06</a> and what tends to be thrown around  
<a onclick="modifyYTiframeseektime('5588')">1:33:08</a> is that statement that is used by the  
<a onclick="modifyYTiframeseektime('5589')">1:33:09</a> salaf  
<a onclick="modifyYTiframeseektime('5595')">1:33:15</a> whoever's bidder is hidden from us then  
<a onclick="modifyYTiframeseektime('5598')">1:33:18</a> his companionship is not hidden do you  
<a onclick="modifyYTiframeseektime('5599')">1:33:19</a> know who said this  
<a onclick="modifyYTiframeseektime('5600')">1:33:20</a> i can't remember now from the top of my  
<a onclick="modifyYTiframeseektime('5602')">1:33:22</a> mind but what i can say to you is  
<a onclick="modifyYTiframeseektime('5604')">1:33:24</a> that a lot of these statements from  
<a onclick="modifyYTiframeseektime('5608')">1:33:28</a> books like  
<a onclick="modifyYTiframeseektime('5611')">1:33:31</a> right uh i actually have somebody who  
<a onclick="modifyYTiframeseektime('5613')">1:33:33</a> preceded me in saying what i'm going to  
<a onclick="modifyYTiframeseektime('5615')">1:33:35</a> say right now  
<a onclick="modifyYTiframeseektime('5618')">1:33:38</a> came to birmingham and  
<a onclick="modifyYTiframeseektime('5622')">1:33:42</a> he was asked this question about  
<a onclick="modifyYTiframeseektime('5624')">1:33:44</a> teaching the books like  
<a onclick="modifyYTiframeseektime('5628')">1:33:48</a> because in this book you're going to  
<a onclick="modifyYTiframeseektime('5630')">1:33:50</a> find some very unrestricted statements  
<a onclick="modifyYTiframeseektime('5632')">1:33:52</a> that can be  
<a onclick="modifyYTiframeseektime('5633')">1:33:53</a> totally taken out of context if this is  
<a onclick="modifyYTiframeseektime('5636')">1:33:56</a> now being taught to a revert  
<a onclick="modifyYTiframeseektime('5637')">1:33:57</a> which we've seen happening right and  
<a onclick="modifyYTiframeseektime('5640')">1:34:00</a> you've got same as like if you see  
<a onclick="modifyYTiframeseektime('5642')">1:34:02</a> somebody with an innovator  
<a onclick="modifyYTiframeseektime('5645')">1:34:05</a> then associate with him every type of  
<a onclick="modifyYTiframeseektime('5647')">1:34:07</a> evil  
<a onclick="modifyYTiframeseektime('5648')">1:34:08</a> okay do not sit with the people of  
<a onclick="modifyYTiframeseektime('5650')">1:34:10</a> innovation  
<a onclick="modifyYTiframeseektime('5652')">1:34:12</a> indeed what this is gonna cause is gonna  
<a onclick="modifyYTiframeseektime('5654')">1:34:14</a> cause sickness to your heart whatever  
<a onclick="modifyYTiframeseektime('5655')">1:34:15</a> have you  
<a onclick="modifyYTiframeseektime('5655')">1:34:15</a> okay yes there are right statements they  
<a onclick="modifyYTiframeseektime('5658')">1:34:18</a> are statements that  
<a onclick="modifyYTiframeseektime('5659')">1:34:19</a> were mentioned by the self we don't deny  
<a onclick="modifyYTiframeseektime('5660')">1:34:20</a> them but what we need to basically agree  
<a onclick="modifyYTiframeseektime('5663')">1:34:23</a> with is who's an innovator

<a onclick="modifyYTiframeseektime('6156')">1:42:36</a> but too many of these brothers maybe  
<a onclick="modifyYTiframeseektime('6157')">1:42:37</a> even jealousy be of the manager huh  
<a onclick="modifyYTiframeseektime('6160')">1:42:40</a> i mean  
<a onclick="modifyYTiframeseektime('6174')">1:42:54</a> one thing that um  
<a onclick="modifyYTiframeseektime('6177')">1:42:57</a> he opened my eyes up to is the books of  
<a onclick="modifyYTiframeseektime('6180')">1:43:00</a> umitamia  
<a onclick="modifyYTiframeseektime('6181')">1:43:01</a> because when i first came back from  
<a onclick="modifyYTiframeseektime('6182')">1:43:02</a> damage i was given a very hard time  
<a onclick="modifyYTiframeseektime('6185')">1:43:05</a> very hard time so much so  
<a onclick="modifyYTiframeseektime('6188')">1:43:08</a> and in fact i can actually relate to  
<a onclick="modifyYTiframeseektime('6190')">1:43:10</a> what yasser is saying at the beginning  
<a onclick="modifyYTiframeseektime('6191')">1:43:11</a> of your podcast when  
<a onclick="modifyYTiframeseektime('6192')">1:43:12</a> he talks about some of the difficulties  
<a onclick="modifyYTiframeseektime('6195')">1:43:15</a> and issues that he went through right  
<a onclick="modifyYTiframeseektime('6196')">1:43:16</a> i can fully relate to that i've seen it  
<a onclick="modifyYTiframeseektime('6198')">1:43:18</a> medina maybe this is something we're  
<a onclick="modifyYTiframeseektime('6199')">1:43:19</a> going to discuss  
<a onclick="modifyYTiframeseektime('6200')">1:43:20</a> the amount of trouble i've been given in  
<a onclick="modifyYTiframeseektime('6202')">1:43:22</a> the last four years just being in medina  
<a onclick="modifyYTiframeseektime('6203')">1:43:23</a> so when i left after spending time in in  
<a onclick="modifyYTiframeseektime('6205')">1:43:25</a> aliyaman and i came back  
<a onclick="modifyYTiframeseektime('6206')">1:43:26</a> i was given a very hard time so much so  
<a onclick="modifyYTiframeseektime('6210')">1:43:30</a> that i began to think is this what dean  
<a onclick="modifyYTiframeseektime('6213')">1:43:33</a> of allah azzawajal is  
<a onclick="modifyYTiframeseektime('6215')">1:43:35</a> when i ran into some of these brothers  
<a onclick="modifyYTiframeseektime('6216')">1:43:36</a> the way they were treating me  
<a onclick="modifyYTiframeseektime('6218')">1:43:38</a> and this was being used under the banner  
<a onclick="modifyYTiframeseektime('6220')">1:43:40</a> of as salivir  
<a onclick="modifyYTiframeseektime('6221')">1:43:41</a> this is the way of the self as salafi is  
<a onclick="modifyYTiframeseektime('6224')">1:43:44</a> this  
<a onclick="modifyYTiframeseektime('6226')">1:43:46</a> is a noble thing it's not what i think  
<a onclick="modifyYTiframeseektime('6228')">1:43:48</a> or what you think muhammad or what my  
<a onclick="modifyYTiframeseektime('6230')">1:43:50</a> sheikh thinks or your  
<a onclick="modifyYTiframeseektime('6232')">1:43:52</a> it is the way of the three golden  
<a onclick="modifyYTiframeseektime('6233')">1:43:53</a> generations  
<a onclick="modifyYTiframeseektime('6235')">1:43:55</a> you see what i'm saying they're  
<a onclick="modifyYTiframeseektime('6236')">1:43:56</a> understanding collectively  
<a onclick="modifyYTiframeseektime('6238')">1:43:58</a> until actually they met the likes of  
<a onclick="modifyYTiframeseektime('6239')">1:43:59</a> shahrukh bhusam  
<a onclick="modifyYTiframeseektime('6242')">1:44:02</a> and also abraham's naveed and later on i  
<a onclick="modifyYTiframeseektime('6244')">1:44:04</a> ended up meeting  
<a onclick="modifyYTiframeseektime('6247')">1:44:07</a> and the common feature amongst us all is  
<a onclick="modifyYTiframeseektime('6248')">1:44:08</a> that we were oppressed by the same group  
<a onclick="modifyYTiframeseektime('6250')">1:44:10</a> of people  
<a onclick="modifyYTiframeseektime('6251')">1:44:11</a> and we were made to look that  
<a onclick="modifyYTiframeseektime('6255')">1:44:15</a> this what we're doing is against the way  
<a onclick="modifyYTiframeseektime('6256')">1:44:16</a> of the self even if you  
<a onclick="modifyYTiframeseektime('6258')">1:44:18</a> repent or retract yes it's not all of  
<a onclick="modifyYTiframeseektime('6260')">1:44:20</a> that stuff you're not good enough  
<a onclick="modifyYTiframeseektime('6264')">1:44:24</a> what happened was the man hasn't said to  
<a onclick="modifyYTiframeseektime('6266')">1:44:26</a> me  
<a onclick="modifyYTiframeseektime('6267')">1:44:27</a> open your eyes up to the books of him  
<a onclick="modifyYTiframeseektime('6271')">1:44:31</a> so one thing he said to me was he was in  
<a onclick="modifyYTiframeseektime('6274')">1:44:34</a> the house of one of these mashach  
<a onclick="modifyYTiframeseektime('6278')">1:44:38</a> i mentioned just maybe i shouldn't  
<a onclick="modifyYTiframeseektime('6282')">1:44:42</a> yeah huh you don't have to yeah just  
<a onclick="modifyYTiframeseektime('6283')">1:44:43</a> let's just leave inshallah it's one of  
<a onclick="modifyYTiframeseektime('6284')">1:44:44</a> the prominent  
<a onclick="modifyYTiframeseektime('6286')">1:44:46</a> of them right and he said to him sheikh  
<a onclick="modifyYTiframeseektime('6288')">1:44:48</a> look  
<a onclick="modifyYTiframeseektime('6289')">1:44:49</a> i have these statements of humanitamia  
<a onclick="modifyYTiframeseektime('6292')">1:44:52</a> like where am i going wrong ibn  
<a onclick="modifyYTiframeseektime('6294')">1:44:54</a> is saying this about boycotting  
<a onclick="modifyYTiframeseektime('6298')">1:44:58</a> the exact wording that he uses right  
<a onclick="modifyYTiframeseektime('6299')">1:44:59</a> that it depends you can't just boycott  
<a onclick="modifyYTiframeseektime('6301')">1:45:01</a> everybody  
<a onclick="modifyYTiframeseektime('6303')">1:45:03</a> and all the other statements that he  
<a onclick="modifyYTiframeseektime('6304')">1:45:04</a> collected  
<a onclick="modifyYTiframeseektime('6311')">1:45:11</a> has gone against the unanimous agreement  
<a onclick="modifyYTiframeseektime('6316')">1:45:16</a> and i i found that shocking i struggled  
<a onclick="modifyYTiframeseektime('6319')">1:45:19</a> to really believe that  
<a onclick="modifyYTiframeseektime('6320')">1:45:20</a> i later on had discussions with some of  
<a onclick="modifyYTiframeseektime('6322')">1:45:22</a> our mashaykh in damage  
<a onclick="modifyYTiframeseektime('6324')">1:45:24</a> i've went to shariat okay one of the  
<a onclick="modifyYTiframeseektime('6326')">1:45:26</a> things that i get criticized for being  
<a onclick="modifyYTiframeseektime('6328')">1:45:28</a> with shariah  
<a onclick="modifyYTiframeseektime('6332')">1:45:32</a> i spent four years in yemen right and i  
<a onclick="modifyYTiframeseektime('6334')">1:45:34</a> took to him i was like  
<a onclick="modifyYTiframeseektime('6337')">1:45:37</a> i don't need to discuss now on camera  
<a onclick="modifyYTiframeseektime('6339')">1:45:39</a> what exactly i discussed this is  
<a onclick="modifyYTiframeseektime('6340')">1:45:40</a> a timid a student going up to  
<a onclick="modifyYTiframeseektime('6344')">1:45:44</a> saying what about this and what about  
<a onclick="modifyYTiframeseektime('6345')">1:45:45</a> this what about that how do we deal with  
<a onclick="modifyYTiframeseektime('6348')">1:45:48</a> these issues of pictures and whatnot  
<a onclick="modifyYTiframeseektime('6349')">1:45:49</a> that  
<a onclick="modifyYTiframeseektime('6350')">1:45:50</a> and these you know and then  
<a onclick="modifyYTiframeseektime('6355')">1:45:55</a> yeah i i just never after i left and i  
<a onclick="modifyYTiframeseektime('6359')">1:45:59</a> started opening my eyes up to him  
<a onclick="modifyYTiframeseektime('6362')">1:46:02</a> [Music]  
<a onclick="modifyYTiframeseektime('6364')">1:46:04</a> i just i just like this doesn't make  
<a onclick="modifyYTiframeseektime('6365')">1:46:05</a> sense  
<a onclick="modifyYTiframeseektime('6367')">1:46:07</a> this is not a productive way of dealing  
<a onclick="modifyYTiframeseektime('6371')">1:46:11</a> with problems of the people  
<a onclick="modifyYTiframeseektime('6375')">1:46:15</a> and of course it's more safer to take  
<a onclick="modifyYTiframeseektime('6379')">1:46:19</a> the position of the scholars of the past  
<a onclick="modifyYTiframeseektime('6384')">1:46:24</a> the one who's living he's not free from  
<a onclick="modifyYTiframeseektime('6386')">1:46:26</a> any fitness so we have the classical  
<a onclick="modifyYTiframeseektime('6388')">1:46:28</a> scholars all saying this  
<a onclick="modifyYTiframeseektime('6390')">1:46:30</a> it's like they're living amongst us  
<a onclick="modifyYTiframeseektime('6394')">1:46:34</a> today they've dealt with our problems  
<a onclick="modifyYTiframeseektime('6396')">1:46:36</a> with how to deal with these issues right  
<a onclick="modifyYTiframeseektime('6398')">1:46:38</a> and i think that's more than sufficient  
<a onclick="modifyYTiframeseektime('6401')">1:46:41</a> yeah how what would you say now probably  
<a onclick="modifyYTiframeseektime('6403')">1:46:43</a> as a final statement to  
<a onclick="modifyYTiframeseektime('6406')">1:46:46</a> about all of the things obviously you're  
<a onclick="modifyYTiframeseektime('6409')">1:46:49</a> one of the people  
<a onclick="modifyYTiframeseektime('6410')">1:46:50</a> who you're very close to although very  
<a onclick="modifyYTiframeseektime('6412')">1:46:52</a> close to  
<a onclick="modifyYTiframeseektime('6415')">1:46:55</a> and you're very close to some of these  
<a onclick="modifyYTiframeseektime('6416')">1:46:56</a> brothers um  
<a onclick="modifyYTiframeseektime('6418')">1:46:58</a> uh and i think they respect and love you  
<a onclick="modifyYTiframeseektime('6419')">1:46:59</a> and i think you feel the same way  
<a onclick="modifyYTiframeseektime('6421')">1:47:01</a> yeah with them as well yeah and uh more  
<a onclick="modifyYTiframeseektime('6423')">1:47:03</a> so i still work with  
<a onclick="modifyYTiframeseektime('6424')">1:47:04</a> knowledge colleges of course i just  
<a onclick="modifyYTiframeseektime('6426')">1:47:06</a> literally finished now what kind of  
<a onclick="modifyYTiframeseektime('6428')">1:47:08</a> uh what collectively you've come to the  
<a onclick="modifyYTiframeseektime('6431')">1:47:11</a> conclude first of all individually you  
<a onclick="modifyYTiframeseektime('6432')">1:47:12</a> came to the conclusion that you know the  
<a onclick="modifyYTiframeseektime('6434')">1:47:14</a> the kind of stunts you took with that  
<a onclick="modifyYTiframeseektime('6436')">1:47:16</a> shiite incident with  
<a onclick="modifyYTiframeseektime('6438')">1:47:18</a> uh it was an oppressive one and the tip  
<a onclick="modifyYTiframeseektime('6440')">1:47:20</a> of the hour was not a good  
<a onclick="modifyYTiframeseektime('6441')">1:47:21</a> idea and but maybe we should calm down a  
<a onclick="modifyYTiframeseektime('6443')">1:47:23</a> bit with tempting out what  
<a onclick="modifyYTiframeseektime('6444')">1:47:24</a> would you think that um would sway  
<a onclick="modifyYTiframeseektime('6448')">1:47:28</a> the other brothers to come to a similar  
<a onclick="modifyYTiframeseektime('6450')">1:47:30</a> conclusion to you  
<a onclick="modifyYTiframeseektime('6452')">1:47:32</a> okay like i mentioned aziz  
<a onclick="modifyYTiframeseektime('6456')">1:47:36</a> sometimes you gotta put your emotions to  
<a onclick="modifyYTiframeseektime('6458')">1:47:38</a> the side past incidents to the side  
<a onclick="modifyYTiframeseektime('6461')">1:47:41</a> and just think about your let me mention  
<a onclick="modifyYTiframeseektime('6463')">1:47:43</a> this narration  
<a onclick="modifyYTiframeseektime('6468')">1:47:48</a> of course he was the hadith of the  
<a onclick="modifyYTiframeseektime('6469')">1:47:49</a> muslims right a man came up to him yes  
<a onclick="modifyYTiframeseektime('6477')">1:47:57</a> he came to complain about somebody  
<a onclick="modifyYTiframeseektime('6478')">1:47:58</a> oppressed him you know  
<a onclick="modifyYTiframeseektime('6481')">1:48:01</a> he said to him  
<a onclick="modifyYTiframeseektime('6494')">1:48:14</a> himself when he's free but you come to  
<a onclick="modifyYTiframeseektime('6497')">1:48:17</a> him when he becomes busy with the  
<a onclick="modifyYTiframeseektime('6498')">1:48:18</a> affairs of the muslims  
<a onclick="modifyYTiframeseektime('6501')">1:48:21</a> he took a whip  
<a onclick="modifyYTiframeseektime('6505')">1:48:25</a> it's like you know one thing that you  
<a onclick="modifyYTiframeseektime('6507')">1:48:27</a> lash people with right  
<a onclick="modifyYTiframeseektime('6511')">1:48:31</a> the man ended up leaving the place while  
<a onclick="modifyYTiframeseektime('6513')">1:48:33</a> he was upset  
<a onclick="modifyYTiframeseektime('6517')">1:48:37</a> you know the type of individual he was  
<a onclick="modifyYTiframeseektime('6520')">1:48:40</a> who would always you know hold himself  
<a onclick="modifyYTiframeseektime('6521')">1:48:41</a> to account he's the one that said  
<a onclick="modifyYTiframeseektime('6525')">1:48:45</a> hold yourself to account before that day  
<a onclick="modifyYTiframeseektime('6526')">1:48:46</a> comes your health to account  
<a onclick="modifyYTiframeseektime('6528')">1:48:48</a> he contemplated upon what he done and he  
<a onclick="modifyYTiframeseektime('6531')">1:48:51</a> asked  
<a onclick="modifyYTiframeseektime('6533')">1:48:53</a> somebody to bring that man again when he  
<a onclick="modifyYTiframeseektime('6535')">1:48:55</a> was brought  
<a onclick="modifyYTiframeseektime('6536')">1:48:56</a> he gave him the whip goes with me  
<a onclick="modifyYTiframeseektime('6542')">1:49:02</a> and the man said no  
<a onclick="modifyYTiframeseektime('6548')">1:49:08</a> i've left my right with allah  
<a onclick="modifyYTiframeseektime('6551')">1:49:11</a> and i've left it with you um i said no  
<a onclick="modifyYTiframeseektime('6554')">1:49:14</a> choose one of the two  
<a onclick="modifyYTiframeseektime('6556')">1:49:16</a> because okay no worries i'm going to  
<a onclick="modifyYTiframeseektime('6557')">1:49:17</a> leave with allah  
<a onclick="modifyYTiframeseektime('6560')">1:49:20</a> and then the man left omar was so upset  
<a onclick="modifyYTiframeseektime('6563')">1:49:23</a> was so down he walked into his house  
<a onclick="modifyYTiframeseektime('6567')">1:49:27</a> prayed to raqqa't and then he just burst  
<a onclick="modifyYTiframeseektime('6569')">1:49:29</a> into tears  
<a onclick="modifyYTiframeseektime('6571')">1:49:31</a> and he said these very beautiful  
<a onclick="modifyYTiframeseektime('6572')">1:49:32</a> statements about himself he said  
<a onclick="modifyYTiframeseektime('6578')">1:49:38</a> he was very low and allah  
<a onclick="modifyYTiframeseektime('6604')">1:50:04</a> a man came to you in order to seek your

<a onclick="modifyYTiframeseektime('6610')">1:50:10</a> oppressing him  
<a onclick="modifyYTiframeseektime('6616')">1:50:16</a> what are you going to say to your lord

<a onclick="modifyYTiframeseektime('6714')">1:51:54</a> way where  
<a onclick="modifyYTiframeseektime('6716')">1:51:56</a> they just really just lighten down  
<a onclick="modifyYTiframeseektime('6718')">1:51:58</a> something that is very

<a onclick="modifyYTiframeseektime('6724')">1:52:04</a> retracting is not an easy thing right  
<a onclick="modifyYTiframeseektime('6727')">1:52:07</a> this thing that i'm doing i've been  
<a onclick="modifyYTiframeseektime('6729')">1:52:09</a> thinking about it for so long  
<a onclick="modifyYTiframeseektime('6733')">1:52:13</a> for the last four years it was brought  
<a onclick="modifyYTiframeseektime('6734')">1:52:14</a> to my attention i've been thinking about  
<a onclick="modifyYTiframeseektime('6735')">1:52:15</a> even more so in the last two years  
<a onclick="modifyYTiframeseektime('6737')">1:52:17</a> and even more so in the last month

<a onclick="modifyYTiframeseektime('6743')">1:52:23</a> brothers are very beloved to you and  
<a onclick="modifyYTiframeseektime('6744')">1:52:24</a> sometimes to say  
<a onclick="modifyYTiframeseektime('6745')">1:52:25</a> something that might be a negative light  
<a onclick="modifyYTiframeseektime('6748')">1:52:28</a> it can be very difficult  
<a onclick="modifyYTiframeseektime('6750')">1:52:30</a> and i really really really hope that  
<a onclick="modifyYTiframeseektime('6753')">1:52:33</a> whatever mentioned doesn't happen to us  
<a onclick="modifyYTiframeseektime('6756')">1:52:36</a> when he said  
<a onclick="modifyYTiframeseektime('6762')">1:52:42</a> when the people they start cooperating  
<a onclick="modifyYTiframeseektime('6764')">1:52:44</a> in sin and evil they will begin to hate  
<a onclick="modifyYTiframeseektime('6765')">1:52:45</a> one another  
<a onclick="modifyYTiframeseektime('6768')">1:52:48</a> okay and like when you see some of these  
<a onclick="modifyYTiframeseektime('6771')">1:52:51</a> like let me give you guys an example of  
<a onclick="modifyYTiframeseektime('6776')">1:52:56</a> a medina  
<a onclick="modifyYTiframeseektime('6780')">1:53:00</a> the six books of hadith in like 28 years  
<a onclick="modifyYTiframeseektime('6782')">1:53:02</a> if i'm not mistaken but don't quote me  
<a onclick="modifyYTiframeseektime('6783')">1:53:03</a> on the years  
<a onclick="modifyYTiframeseektime('6785')">1:53:05</a> and he's then when started teaching the  
<a onclick="modifyYTiframeseektime('6787')">1:53:07</a> books again  
<a onclick="modifyYTiframeseektime('6788')">1:53:08</a> he's maybe in his early 90s or late 80s  
<a onclick="modifyYTiframeseektime('6791')">1:53:11</a> you can just quickly do a google check  
<a onclick="modifyYTiframeseektime('6792')">1:53:12</a> and you'll find this right  
<a onclick="modifyYTiframeseektime('6795')">1:53:15</a> how many times have i heard him say this  
<a onclick="modifyYTiframeseektime('6798')">1:53:18</a> the hectic  
<a onclick="modifyYTiframeseektime('6800')">1:53:20</a> he is like the scholar of the scholars

<a onclick="modifyYTiframeseektime('6805')">1:53:25</a> how many times have i heard him say  
<a onclick="modifyYTiframeseektime('6807')">1:53:27</a> allah  
<a onclick="modifyYTiframeseektime('6810')">1:53:30</a> and i don't even study with him the only  
<a onclick="modifyYTiframeseektime('6812')">1:53:32</a> time i've studied with him was  
<a onclick="modifyYTiframeseektime('6813')">1:53:33</a> like i finished the book with him  
<a onclick="modifyYTiframeseektime('6817')">1:53:37</a> this was recently when he taught it  
<a onclick="modifyYTiframeseektime('6819')">1:53:39</a> before he started teaching the  
<a onclick="modifyYTiframeseektime('6821')">1:53:41</a> malik how do i know this sometimes when  
<a onclick="modifyYTiframeseektime('6824')">1:53:44</a> i leave my halakhah i just basically  
<a onclick="modifyYTiframeseektime('6826')">1:53:46</a> stand there  
<a onclick="modifyYTiframeseektime('6827')">1:53:47</a> and i'm listening to the q and a's he  
<a onclick="modifyYTiframeseektime('6830')">1:53:50</a> says  
<a onclick="modifyYTiframeseektime('6833')">1:53:53</a> and sometimes he would even give a fatwa  
<a onclick="modifyYTiframeseektime('6835')">1:53:55</a> and he retracted later on  
<a onclick="modifyYTiframeseektime('6837')">1:53:57</a> like one of the towers that he recently  
<a onclick="modifyYTiframeseektime('6838')">1:53:58</a> gave regards to the coronavirus  
<a onclick="modifyYTiframeseektime('6840')">1:54:00</a> about you know how you pray in the haram  
<a onclick="modifyYTiframeseektime('6842')">1:54:02</a> they praying well there's a distance

<a onclick="modifyYTiframeseektime('6845')">1:54:05</a> huh he gave the fat when he said this is  
<a onclick="modifyYTiframeseektime('6847')">1:54:07</a> no that you can't do this  
<a onclick="modifyYTiframeseektime('6850')">1:54:10</a> and then later on when the legend spoke  
<a onclick="modifyYTiframeseektime('6851')">1:54:11</a> about it he retracted his statement  
<a onclick="modifyYTiframeseektime('6856')">1:54:16</a> somebody was very dear to my heart right  
<a onclick="modifyYTiframeseektime('6859')">1:54:19</a> and i'm just giving you guys a couple of  
<a onclick="modifyYTiframeseektime('6860')">1:54:20</a> examples of some of these mountains

<a onclick="modifyYTiframeseektime('6872')">1:54:32</a> where he was teaching us uh just after  
<a onclick="modifyYTiframeseektime('6875')">1:54:35</a> maghrib  
<a onclick="modifyYTiframeseektime('6876')">1:54:36</a> he was quoting the verses and he was  
<a onclick="modifyYTiframeseektime('6878')">1:54:38</a> trying to make a point about toheidan  
<a onclick="modifyYTiframeseektime('6887')">1:54:47</a> he mentioned that right then he  
<a onclick="modifyYTiframeseektime('6889')">1:54:49</a> mentioned the other ayah that's just on  
<a onclick="modifyYTiframeseektime('6891')">1:54:51</a> the next page  
<a onclick="modifyYTiframeseektime('6892')">1:54:52</a> when allah said  
<a onclick="modifyYTiframeseektime('6897')">1:54:57</a> that's basically the ayah right  
<a onclick="modifyYTiframeseektime('6902')">1:55:02</a> when he mentioned the ayah i've never  
<a onclick="modifyYTiframeseektime('6906')">1:55:06</a> had the ayah before  
<a onclick="modifyYTiframeseektime('6908')">1:55:08</a> he mentioned it in a way that is not in  
<a onclick="modifyYTiframeseektime('6910')">1:55:10</a> the quran  
<a onclick="modifyYTiframeseektime('6923')">1:55:23</a> it was very unintentional it happens to  
<a onclick="modifyYTiframeseektime('6925')">1:55:25</a> us sometimes we might misquote an ayah  
<a onclick="modifyYTiframeseektime('6927')">1:55:27</a> right  
<a onclick="modifyYTiframeseektime('6928')">1:55:28</a> i'm sitting in the class i'm actually

<a onclick="modifyYTiframeseektime('6934')">1:55:34</a> i'm asking myself  
<a onclick="modifyYTiframeseektime('6938')">1:55:38</a> next lesson after obviously saying  
<a onclick="modifyYTiframeseektime('6943')">1:55:43</a> because yesterday i made a mistake i was  
<a onclick="modifyYTiframeseektime('6944')">1:55:44</a> trying to quote an eye but i completely  
<a onclick="modifyYTiframeseektime('6946')">1:55:46</a> misquoted it  
<a onclick="modifyYTiframeseektime('6949')">1:55:49</a> when you think about it is this actually  
<a onclick="modifyYTiframeseektime('6952')">1:55:52</a> really difficult for them i don't  
<a onclick="modifyYTiframeseektime('6953')">1:55:53</a> believe it's difficult for them  
<a onclick="modifyYTiframeseektime('6955')">1:55:55</a> when you come to realization that those  
<a onclick="modifyYTiframeseektime('6957')">1:55:57</a> who are far greater than you  
<a onclick="modifyYTiframeseektime('6959')">1:55:59</a> from the look look at the look  
<a onclick="modifyYTiframeseektime('6964')">1:56:04</a> was not like any other companion i'm  
<a onclick="modifyYTiframeseektime('6965')">1:56:05</a> going to conclude with this right  
<a onclick="modifyYTiframeseektime('6970')">1:56:10</a> he was the top when it comes to the  
<a onclick="modifyYTiframeseektime('6971')">1:56:11</a> hadith he memorized even have  
<a onclick="modifyYTiframeseektime('6988')">1:56:28</a> doesn't ring a bell to most people but  
<a onclick="modifyYTiframeseektime('6990')">1:56:30</a> you say  
<a onclick="modifyYTiframeseektime('6992')">1:56:32</a> everybody knows him the sunnis know him  
<a onclick="modifyYTiframeseektime('6994')">1:56:34</a> the shiites know him as all  
<a onclick="modifyYTiframeseektime('6995')">1:56:35</a> and they've got their observations on  
<a onclick="modifyYTiframeseektime('6997')">1:56:37</a> this great wonderful companion right  
<a onclick="modifyYTiframeseektime('7000')">1:56:40</a> even harry one of them companions that  
<a onclick="modifyYTiframeseektime('7002')">1:56:42</a> didn't memorize  
<a onclick="modifyYTiframeseektime('7004')">1:56:44</a> anywhere near what they did he came up  
<a onclick="modifyYTiframeseektime('7007')">1:56:47</a> to him and he said to him  
<a onclick="modifyYTiframeseektime('7008')">1:56:48</a> oh you made a mistake used to give  
<a onclick="modifyYTiframeseektime('7012')">1:56:52</a> the fats with that if the adana fajr  
<a onclick="modifyYTiframeseektime('7016')">1:56:56</a> goes off  
<a onclick="modifyYTiframeseektime('7017')">1:56:57</a> right and you're in the state of janaba  
<a onclick="modifyYTiframeseektime('7019')">1:56:59</a> whether it was because of relations or  
<a onclick="modifyYTiframeseektime('7020')">1:57:00</a> whether you were  
<a onclick="modifyYTiframeseektime('7022')">1:57:02</a> you had the wet dream you can't fast  
<a onclick="modifyYTiframeseektime('7023')">1:57:03</a> that day and he gave the sweater for a  
<a onclick="modifyYTiframeseektime('7025')">1:57:05</a> very long time  
<a onclick="modifyYTiframeseektime('7027')">1:57:07</a> until abdu's came  
<a onclick="modifyYTiframeseektime('7032')">1:57:12</a> both of them saying that  
<a onclick="modifyYTiframeseektime('7036')">1:57:16</a> what you're saying is incorrect they're  
<a onclick="modifyYTiframeseektime('7038')">1:57:18</a> basically saying the opposite  
<a onclick="modifyYTiframeseektime('7040')">1:57:20</a> look at his response he didn't turn  
<a onclick="modifyYTiframeseektime('7042')">1:57:22</a> around and say  
<a onclick="modifyYTiframeseektime('7044')">1:57:24</a> like i am i am i've memorized x amount  
<a onclick="modifyYTiframeseektime('7047')">1:57:27</a> of a hadith  
<a onclick="modifyYTiframeseektime('7050')">1:57:30</a> did they really say this  
<a onclick="modifyYTiframeseektime('7055')">1:57:35</a> if that is the case they are more  
<a onclick="modifyYTiframeseektime('7056')">1:57:36</a> knowledgeable than me forgot this issue  
<a onclick="modifyYTiframeseektime('7058')">1:57:38</a> and he retracted his statement even  
<a onclick="modifyYTiframeseektime('7061')">1:57:41</a> faith suggests and recently retracted  
<a onclick="modifyYTiframeseektime('7063')">1:57:43</a> some things that he mentioned with  
<a onclick="modifyYTiframeseektime('7064')">1:57:44</a> regards to this whole corona virus  
<a onclick="modifyYTiframeseektime('7070')">1:57:50</a> so um it's important you know we  
<a onclick="modifyYTiframeseektime('7075')">1:57:55</a> just kind of like accept it we swallow  
<a onclick="modifyYTiframeseektime('7078')">1:57:58</a> the ego  
<a onclick="modifyYTiframeseektime('7078')">1:57:58</a> and we bite our tongues and just you  
<a onclick="modifyYTiframeseektime('7081')">1:58:01</a> know  
<a onclick="modifyYTiframeseektime('7082')">1:58:02</a> and and what you did basically in the  
<a onclick="modifyYTiframeseektime('7085')">1:58:05</a> video is always it's very highly  
<a onclick="modifyYTiframeseektime('7086')">1:58:06</a> respectable  
<a onclick="modifyYTiframeseektime('7088')">1:58:08</a> you know and uh  
<a onclick="modifyYTiframeseektime('7091')">1:58:11</a> when you basically said that you said he  
<a onclick="modifyYTiframeseektime('7093')">1:58:13</a> was mistaken  
<a onclick="modifyYTiframeseektime('7094')">1:58:14</a> it takes a man to do that right i've  
<a onclick="modifyYTiframeseektime('7097')">1:58:17</a> done that i've  
<a onclick="modifyYTiframeseektime('7098')">1:58:18</a> i've had so many retractions brother you  
<a onclick="modifyYTiframeseektime('7100')">1:58:20</a> know

<a onclick="modifyYTiframeseektime('7104')">1:58:24</a> and the other thing is and i think it's  
<a onclick="modifyYTiframeseektime('7105')">1:58:25</a> important that we discuss this is  
<a onclick="modifyYTiframeseektime('7107')">1:58:27</a> by the way it disarms people as well  
<a onclick="modifyYTiframeseektime('7108')">1:58:28</a> like when you  
<a onclick="modifyYTiframeseektime('7110')">1:58:30</a> when you've made a mistake and it's  
<a onclick="modifyYTiframeseektime('7111')">1:58:31</a> clear for the majority to see at least  
<a onclick="modifyYTiframeseektime('7113')">1:58:33</a> yeah  
<a onclick="modifyYTiframeseektime('7114')">1:58:34</a> and it's a mistake you know i've made  
<a onclick="modifyYTiframeseektime('7117')">1:58:37</a> many of them  
<a onclick="modifyYTiframeseektime('7118')">1:58:38</a> as you as people know like uh i've made  
<a onclick="modifyYTiframeseektime('7121')">1:58:41</a> videos about my mistakes  
<a onclick="modifyYTiframeseektime('7122')">1:58:42</a> muhammad hijab exposed i made a couple  
<a onclick="modifyYTiframeseektime('7124')">1:58:44</a> of videos okay i've never watched them  
<a onclick="modifyYTiframeseektime('7131')">1:58:51</a> so but i was going to say is that yeah  
<a onclick="modifyYTiframeseektime('7135')">1:58:55</a> it's just to sums people because  
<a onclick="modifyYTiframeseektime('7137')">1:58:57</a> you want your record to be clean as  
<a onclick="modifyYTiframeseektime('7139')">1:58:59</a> possible and you know you're going to be  
<a onclick="modifyYTiframeseektime('7140')">1:59:00</a> making mistakes especially at a young  
<a onclick="modifyYTiframeseektime('7142')">1:59:02</a> age you know you're going to be making  
<a onclick="modifyYTiframeseektime('7143')">1:59:03</a> mistakes so

<a onclick="modifyYTiframeseektime('7146')">1:59:06</a> just get out of the way and  
<a onclick="modifyYTiframeseektime('7147')">1:59:07</a> kind of move on yeah it's it's something  
<a onclick="modifyYTiframeseektime('7150')">1:59:10</a> that universally happens with everybody  
<a onclick="modifyYTiframeseektime('7165')">1:59:25</a> you you seek more knowledge even if you  
<a onclick="modifyYTiframeseektime('7167')">1:59:27</a> tell me he said  
<a onclick="modifyYTiframeseektime('7171')">1:59:31</a> the more you increase knowledge you  
<a onclick="modifyYTiframeseektime('7172')">1:59:32</a> become more merciful right that's  
<a onclick="modifyYTiframeseektime('7174')">1:59:34</a> beautiful  
<a onclick="modifyYTiframeseektime('7174')">1:59:34</a> yeah and um you really tend to think  
<a onclick="modifyYTiframeseektime('7178')">1:59:38</a> about things more and  
<a onclick="modifyYTiframeseektime('7180')">1:59:40</a> and and there's no harm you make  
<a onclick="modifyYTiframeseektime('7182')">1:59:42</a> mistakes even  
<a onclick="modifyYTiframeseektime('7183')">1:59:43</a> says to me all the time that he made you  
<a onclick="modifyYTiframeseektime('7186')">1:59:46</a> know he used to say things like  
<a onclick="modifyYTiframeseektime('7188')">1:59:48</a> telling everybody that you have to all  
<a onclick="modifyYTiframeseektime('7190')">1:59:50</a> make hijra jiben  
<a onclick="modifyYTiframeseektime('7191')">1:59:51</a> as soon as they came back and all of

<a onclick="modifyYTiframeseektime('7194')">1:59:54</a> but then you kind of like the more you  
<a onclick="modifyYTiframeseektime('7196')">1:59:56</a> give the hour you kind of mature  
<a onclick="modifyYTiframeseektime('7198')">1:59:58</a> through it and yeah and when you when

<a onclick="modifyYTiframeseektime('7202')">2:00:02</a> is yeah see what i'm saying yeah and  
<a onclick="modifyYTiframeseektime('7205')">2:00:05</a> things also very very important that we  
<a onclick="modifyYTiframeseektime('7206')">2:00:06</a> touch on this is  
<a onclick="modifyYTiframeseektime('7208')">2:00:08</a> just because i take a view it's not fair  
<a onclick="modifyYTiframeseektime('7211')">2:00:11</a> that my brother who i may have been  
<a onclick="modifyYTiframeseektime('7214')">2:00:14</a> seen with yeah okay is painted with the

<a onclick="modifyYTiframeseektime('7257')">2:00:57</a> always seen i've seen that  
<a onclick="modifyYTiframeseektime('7258')">2:00:58</a> we sat for how many years what two  
<a onclick="modifyYTiframeseektime('7260')">2:01:00</a> hedges we jumped into and we sat down  
<a onclick="modifyYTiframeseektime('7262')">2:01:02</a> and we talked and

<a onclick="modifyYTiframeseektime('7268')">2:01:08</a> i took it with a pinch of salt and i  
<a onclick="modifyYTiframeseektime('7269')">2:01:09</a> thought about it and it was one of the  
<a onclick="modifyYTiframeseektime('7271')">2:01:11</a> things that  
<a onclick="modifyYTiframeseektime('7272')">2:01:12</a> we discussed as well right and i told

<a onclick="modifyYTiframeseektime('7282')">2:01:22</a> of the brothers that i teach  
<a onclick="modifyYTiframeseektime('7283')">2:01:23</a> i don't think i'm the type of person who  
<a onclick="modifyYTiframeseektime('7284')">2:01:24</a> enforces his views  
<a onclick="modifyYTiframeseektime('7286')">2:01:26</a> i have this rough and tough what you  
<a onclick="modifyYTiframeseektime('7288')">2:01:28</a> call it mentality if you don't take my  
<a onclick="modifyYTiframeseektime('7290')">2:01:30</a> view  
<a onclick="modifyYTiframeseektime('7290')">2:01:30</a> i'm gonna throw you off or i'm gonna  
<a onclick="modifyYTiframeseektime('7292')">2:01:32</a> boycott you or whatever have you right  
<a onclick="modifyYTiframeseektime('7294')">2:01:34</a> it's been done to me before somebody  
<a onclick="modifyYTiframeseektime('7295')">2:01:35</a> said to me bro if you don't leave this  
<a onclick="modifyYTiframeseektime('7297')">2:01:37</a> i'm gonna boycott you  
<a onclick="modifyYTiframeseektime('7299')">2:01:39</a> okay go do whatever you wanna he like i

<a onclick="modifyYTiframeseektime('7302')">2:01:42</a> with you and at the end of the day you  
<a onclick="modifyYTiframeseektime('7305')">2:01:45</a> know it's uh  
<a onclick="modifyYTiframeseektime('7307')">2:01:47</a> it's been said to me so i know how he  
<a onclick="modifyYTiframeseektime('7308')">2:01:48</a> feels and i've seen people's  
<a onclick="modifyYTiframeseektime('7310')">2:01:50</a> relationships like a teacher student  
<a onclick="modifyYTiframeseektime('7312')">2:01:52</a> relation get a bit frosty as all because  
<a onclick="modifyYTiframeseektime('7314')">2:01:54</a> of the pushy roughy type of  
<a onclick="modifyYTiframeseektime('7318')">2:01:58</a> way that one was trying to get maybe his  
<a onclick="modifyYTiframeseektime('7321')">2:02:01</a> message across and i seen it doesn't go  
<a onclick="modifyYTiframeseektime('7324')">2:02:04</a> down nicely  
<a onclick="modifyYTiframeseektime('7325')">2:02:05</a> so my position with everybody is bro  
<a onclick="modifyYTiframeseektime('7327')">2:02:07</a> this is my view  
<a onclick="modifyYTiframeseektime('7330')">2:02:10</a> if you want to take is entirely up to  
<a onclick="modifyYTiframeseektime('7331')">2:02:11</a> you okay  
<a onclick="modifyYTiframeseektime('7334')">2:02:14</a> and um and i'll just advise a person  
<a onclick="modifyYTiframeseektime('7337')">2:02:17</a> and because i've advised him now does  
<a onclick="modifyYTiframeseektime('7339')">2:02:19</a> that mean i'm going to boycott i'm going  
<a onclick="modifyYTiframeseektime('7340')">2:02:20</a> to stop work doing that with him  
<a onclick="modifyYTiframeseektime('7343')">2:02:23</a> yeah and some people want that you see  
<a onclick="modifyYTiframeseektime('7345')">2:02:25</a> what i'm saying  
<a onclick="modifyYTiframeseektime('7346')">2:02:26</a> just because you've differed with so and  
<a onclick="modifyYTiframeseektime('7348')">2:02:28</a> so they want you to differ okay i've  
<a onclick="modifyYTiframeseektime('7349')">2:02:29</a> differed with him halas boycotting i  
<a onclick="modifyYTiframeseektime('7352')">2:02:32</a> don't think that's a productive way to  
<a onclick="modifyYTiframeseektime('7353')">2:02:33</a> kind of like  
<a onclick="modifyYTiframeseektime('7354')">2:02:34</a> really go forward as well some people  
<a onclick="modifyYTiframeseektime('7357')">2:02:37</a> have like ultra motives as well and  
<a onclick="modifyYTiframeseektime('7359')">2:02:39</a> everything yeah and i think  
<a onclick="modifyYTiframeseektime('7360')">2:02:40</a> that that attitude is um especially i'm  
<a onclick="modifyYTiframeseektime('7362')">2:02:42</a> going to say especially in in the  
<a onclick="modifyYTiframeseektime('7364')">2:02:44</a> muslim community those who attribute  
<a onclick="modifyYTiframeseektime('7367')">2:02:47</a> themselves to salafia if they if  
<a onclick="modifyYTiframeseektime('7370')">2:02:50</a> everyone attributed themselves salafiyah  
<a onclick="modifyYTiframeseektime('7372')">2:02:52</a> had this kind of attitude you know well  
<a onclick="modifyYTiframeseektime('7375')">2:02:55</a> i think we'd have  
<a onclick="modifyYTiframeseektime('7376')">2:02:56</a> more productive uh and more  
<a onclick="modifyYTiframeseektime('7380')">2:03:00</a> you know effective tower uh as as a  
<a onclick="modifyYTiframeseektime('7383')">2:03:03</a> muslim community as a whole  
<a onclick="modifyYTiframeseektime('7385')">2:03:05</a> and so i wanted to thank you for coming  
<a onclick="modifyYTiframeseektime('7387')">2:03:07</a> on to this podcast i think it's been  
<a onclick="modifyYTiframeseektime('7389')">2:03:09</a> extremely productive and um again let me  
<a onclick="modifyYTiframeseektime('7392')">2:03:12</a> just point out before this gets  
<a onclick="modifyYTiframeseektime('7393')">2:03:13</a> misconstrued as all right  
<a onclick="modifyYTiframeseektime('7395')">2:03:15</a> there is issues that go back to a  
<a onclick="modifyYTiframeseektime('7398')">2:03:18</a> person's hd head  
<a onclick="modifyYTiframeseektime('7399')">2:03:19</a> yeah okay and there's some issues here  
<a onclick="modifyYTiframeseektime('7401')">2:03:21</a> that is  
<a onclick="modifyYTiframeseektime('7402')">2:03:22</a> credo type matters right and we're not  
<a onclick="modifyYTiframeseektime('7404')">2:03:24</a> discussing this at the moment we're  
<a onclick="modifyYTiframeseektime('7405')">2:03:25</a> speaking about  
<a onclick="modifyYTiframeseektime('7406')">2:03:26</a> other personalities he had the issues  
<a onclick="modifyYTiframeseektime('7408')">2:03:28</a> yeah uh  
<a onclick="modifyYTiframeseektime('7409')">2:03:29</a> a person like wants to maybe do  
<a onclick="modifyYTiframeseektime('7411')">2:03:31</a> something i might disagree with him of  
<a onclick="modifyYTiframeseektime('7413')">2:03:33</a> how he goes to do  
<a onclick="modifyYTiframeseektime('7414')">2:03:34</a> a particular thing just because i don't  
<a onclick="modifyYTiframeseektime('7417')">2:03:37</a> agree with him that's why i'm gonna  
<a onclick="modifyYTiframeseektime('7418')">2:03:38</a> boycott him or throw him off you see  
<a onclick="modifyYTiframeseektime('7420')">2:03:40</a> what i'm saying  
<a onclick="modifyYTiframeseektime('7420')">2:03:40</a> and a lot of the time you see that it  
<a onclick="modifyYTiframeseektime('7422')">2:03:42</a> goes back to these issues  
<a onclick="modifyYTiframeseektime('7424')">2:03:44</a> now you find people calling this an  
<a onclick="modifyYTiframeseektime('7426')">2:03:46</a> individual innovator or  
<a onclick="modifyYTiframeseektime('7428')">2:03:48</a> this and that tends to come back to  
<a onclick="modifyYTiframeseektime('7430')">2:03:50</a> these kind of things isn't it  
<a onclick="modifyYTiframeseektime('7431')">2:03:51</a> and i think you're a living example of  
<a onclick="modifyYTiframeseektime('7433')">2:03:53</a> someone who starts off  
<a onclick="modifyYTiframeseektime('7435')">2:03:55</a> with um with a certain kind of approach  
<a onclick="modifyYTiframeseektime('7438')">2:03:58</a> and then  
<a onclick="modifyYTiframeseektime('7438')">2:03:58</a> what the more reading the more knowledge  
<a onclick="modifyYTiframeseektime('7440')">2:04:00</a> the more nuanced the more  
<a onclick="modifyYTiframeseektime('7442')">2:04:02</a> sophisticated you become for sharing  
<a onclick="modifyYTiframeseektime('7445')">2:04:05</a> your thoughts i think  
<a onclick="modifyYTiframeseektime('7446')">2:04:06</a> many of the things you've said people  
<a onclick="modifyYTiframeseektime('7448')">2:04:08</a> would resonate with and find really  
<a onclick="modifyYTiframeseektime('7450')">2:04:10</a> productive soldiers  
<a onclick="modifyYTiframeseektime('7453')">2:04:13</a> and uh for those watching insha allah  
<a onclick="modifyYTiframeseektime('7455')">2:04:15</a> you can uh
