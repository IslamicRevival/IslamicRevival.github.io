<a onclick="modifyYTiframeseektime('129')">0:02:09</a> to be  
<a onclick="modifyYTiframeseektime('130')">0:02:10</a> said to the public  
<a onclick="modifyYTiframeseektime('131')">0:02:11</a> now  
<a onclick="modifyYTiframeseektime('132')">0:02:12</a> a lot of us nowadays we we have so many  
<a onclick="modifyYTiframeseektime('135')">0:02:15</a> diet plans to choose from  
<a onclick="modifyYTiframeseektime('137')">0:02:17</a> we've got the carnivorous diet we have  
<a onclick="modifyYTiframeseektime('139')">0:02:19</a> the ketogenic diet we have uh vegan  
<a onclick="modifyYTiframeseektime('142')">0:02:22</a> vegan diet uh you know we have calorie  
<a onclick="modifyYTiframeseektime('144')">0:02:24</a> deficit we have you know fat fat deficit  
<a onclick="modifyYTiframeseektime('147')">0:02:27</a> so many deficits so many different diets  
<a onclick="modifyYTiframeseektime('150')">0:02:30</a> uh it's intermittent fasting has become  
<a onclick="modifyYTiframeseektime('152')">0:02:32</a> really big there's so many different  
<a onclick="modifyYTiframeseektime('154')">0:02:34</a> youtubers now that are on the scene that  
<a onclick="modifyYTiframeseektime('156')">0:02:36</a> given their own diet plans  
<a onclick="modifyYTiframeseektime('158')">0:02:38</a> this is becoming so confusing now mm-hmm  
<a onclick="modifyYTiframeseektime('161')">0:02:41</a> honestly it's i'm speaking from  
<a onclick="modifyYTiframeseektime('163')">0:02:43</a> experience when you it's almost as if  
<a onclick="modifyYTiframeseektime('166')">0:02:46</a> now there's competing schools of thought  
<a onclick="modifyYTiframeseektime('168')">0:02:48</a> you have the keto school of thought  
<a onclick="modifyYTiframeseektime('169')">0:02:49</a> where everything keto is good you know  
<a onclick="modifyYTiframeseektime('172')">0:02:52</a> and you have people that you know the  
<a onclick="modifyYTiframeseektime('173')">0:02:53</a> solution  
<a onclick="modifyYTiframeseektime('174')">0:02:54</a> to everything is ketogenic diet and  
<a onclick="modifyYTiframeseektime('176')">0:02:56</a> intermittent fasting and then you have  
<a onclick="modifyYTiframeseektime('177')">0:02:57</a> other people that say no actually no  
<a onclick="modifyYTiframeseektime('179')">0:02:59</a> this is nonsense let's go the opposite  
<a onclick="modifyYTiframeseektime('180')">0:03:00</a> way  
<a onclick="modifyYTiframeseektime('181')">0:03:01</a> or the carnivorous diet which is quite  
<a onclick="modifyYTiframeseektime('183')">0:03:03</a> close to quito  
<a onclick="modifyYTiframeseektime('185')">0:03:05</a> what do we do  
<a onclick="modifyYTiframeseektime('187')">0:03:07</a> i would say i love uh there's a paul  
<a onclick="modifyYTiframeseektime('188')">0:03:08</a> check quote that i absolutely love he  
<a onclick="modifyYTiframeseektime('190')">0:03:10</a> says look we're as different on the  
<a onclick="modifyYTiframeseektime('191')">0:03:11</a> inside as we are on the outside it's  
<a onclick="modifyYTiframeseektime('193')">0:03:13</a> such an important quote because it's  
<a onclick="modifyYTiframeseektime('194')">0:03:14</a> true look at the differences we have on  
<a onclick="modifyYTiframeseektime('195')">0:03:15</a> the outside you're not everybody's gonna  
<a onclick="modifyYTiframeseektime('198')">0:03:18</a> react the same way to the same diet  
<a onclick="modifyYTiframeseektime('201')">0:03:21</a> so there's some exploration now i i  
<a onclick="modifyYTiframeseektime('203')">0:03:23</a> personally think that  
<a onclick="modifyYTiframeseektime('205')">0:03:25</a> you should  
<a onclick="modifyYTiframeseektime('206')">0:03:26</a> try to choose a diet that you can live  
<a onclick="modifyYTiframeseektime('207')">0:03:27</a> with for the rest of your life  
<a onclick="modifyYTiframeseektime('210')">0:03:30</a> so if me personally i can't do keto i  
<a onclick="modifyYTiframeseektime('212')">0:03:32</a> can do keto for a little while then i  
<a onclick="modifyYTiframeseektime('214')">0:03:34</a> get bored of it i want to eat  
<a onclick="modifyYTiframeseektime('215')">0:03:35</a> carbohydrates i have i'm drawn to

<a onclick="modifyYTiframeseektime('229')">0:03:49</a> with why does protein fit into that five  
<a onclick="modifyYTiframeseektime('231')">0:03:51</a> cell um i have i have proteins but if i  
<a onclick="modifyYTiframeseektime('233')">0:03:53</a> want to lean up i go more towards egg

<a onclick="modifyYTiframeseektime('358')">0:05:58</a> when you eat carbs you retain more water

<a onclick="modifyYTiframeseektime('380')">0:06:20</a> you eat  
<a onclick="modifyYTiframeseektime('381')">0:06:21</a> it's a it's basically i'm not vegan okay  
<a onclick="modifyYTiframeseektime('383')">0:06:23</a> but i'm i'm  
<a onclick="modifyYTiframeseektime('385')">0:06:25</a> i don't believe we need so much animal  
<a onclick="modifyYTiframeseektime('387')">0:06:27</a> products okay there's a animal products  
<a onclick="modifyYTiframeseektime('389')">0:06:29</a> are really pushed on us because  
<a onclick="modifyYTiframeseektime('391')">0:06:31</a> i think it's it's big business right i  
<a onclick="modifyYTiframeseektime('394')">0:06:34</a> do believe in eating meat i think you  
<a onclick="modifyYTiframeseektime('395')">0:06:35</a> can have a deficiency on vegan diet long  
<a onclick="modifyYTiframeseektime('396')">0:06:36</a> term you can have problems what do you  
<a onclick="modifyYTiframeseektime('398')">0:06:38</a> think of just on this point what do you  
<a onclick="modifyYTiframeseektime('399')">0:06:39</a> think of the arguments that are being  
<a onclick="modifyYTiframeseektime('401')">0:06:41</a> put by many who kind of have a vegan  
<a onclick="modifyYTiframeseektime('403')">0:06:43</a> diet um the chi i think the china study  
<a onclick="modifyYTiframeseektime('406')">0:06:46</a> whatever of the meat and they say it's  
<a onclick="modifyYTiframeseektime('408')">0:06:48</a> um it brings you know there's a  
<a onclick="modifyYTiframeseektime('410')">0:06:50</a> correlation between cancer for example  
<a onclick="modifyYTiframeseektime('412')">0:06:52</a> um  
<a onclick="modifyYTiframeseektime('414')">0:06:54</a> to what extent do you kind of look at is  
<a onclick="modifyYTiframeseektime('415')">0:06:55</a> it meat or excessive amounts of meat  
<a onclick="modifyYTiframeseektime('417')">0:06:57</a> that's why i differentiate okay i think  
<a onclick="modifyYTiframeseektime('419')">0:06:59</a> eating meat three times a day is crazy i  
<a onclick="modifyYTiframeseektime('420')">0:07:00</a> think it's insane you might as well be a  
<a onclick="modifyYTiframeseektime('422')">0:07:02</a> smoker right okay you don't need that  
<a onclick="modifyYTiframeseektime('424')">0:07:04</a> much meat okay now i like to eat meat  
<a onclick="modifyYTiframeseektime('426')">0:07:06</a> when we're sitting around in a social  
<a onclick="modifyYTiframeseektime('428')">0:07:08</a> gathering okay somebody cooked meat  
<a onclick="modifyYTiframeseektime('429')">0:07:09</a> let's eat it and that includes fish by  
<a onclick="modifyYTiframeseektime('431')">0:07:11</a> the way  
<a onclick="modifyYTiframeseektime('432')">0:07:12</a> every type of animal product right even  
<a onclick="modifyYTiframeseektime('434')">0:07:14</a> if it's even  
<a onclick="modifyYTiframeseektime('435')">0:07:15</a> eggs and cheese every single animal  
<a onclick="modifyYTiframeseektime('438')">0:07:18</a> product mass-produced product in in one  
<a onclick="modifyYTiframeseektime('440')">0:07:20</a> way or another they they've  
<a onclick="modifyYTiframeseektime('442')">0:07:22</a> i hate to use the word poisoned it but  
<a onclick="modifyYTiframeseektime('443')">0:07:23</a> they they've done some bad things to it  
<a onclick="modifyYTiframeseektime('446')">0:07:26</a> yes you can get away  
<a onclick="modifyYTiframeseektime('447')">0:07:27</a> around it because  
<a onclick="modifyYTiframeseektime('449')">0:07:29</a> if you want to mass produce it they have  
<a onclick="modifyYTiframeseektime('451')">0:07:31</a> to mess with it  
<a onclick="modifyYTiframeseektime('454')">0:07:34</a> that's almost true of all our foods but  
<a onclick="modifyYTiframeseektime('455')">0:07:35</a> grains rice oatmeal pastas  
<a onclick="modifyYTiframeseektime('459')">0:07:39</a> if you have if you if you take in low  
<a onclick="modifyYTiframeseektime('461')">0:07:41</a> fat high carb you won't get fat just  
<a onclick="modifyYTiframeseektime('463')">0:07:43</a> like you won't get fat if you do high  
<a onclick="modifyYTiframeseektime('465')">0:07:45</a> fat low carb you could do it the other  
<a onclick="modifyYTiframeseektime('467')">0:07:47</a> way around  
<a onclick="modifyYTiframeseektime('468')">0:07:48</a> i prefer  
<a onclick="modifyYTiframeseektime('469')">0:07:49</a> high carb low fat because i'm in a  
<a onclick="modifyYTiframeseektime('471')">0:07:51</a> glycogen export i need that glycogen and  
<a onclick="modifyYTiframeseektime('472')">0:07:52</a> i feel full and satisfied one book i  
<a onclick="modifyYTiframeseektime('474')">0:07:54</a> really recommend is the starch  
<a onclick="modifyYTiframeseektime('477')">0:07:57</a> starch solution by john mcdougall  
<a onclick="modifyYTiframeseektime('480')">0:08:00</a> i think it's a fantastic book i think  
<a onclick="modifyYTiframeseektime('481')">0:08:01</a> people should try it  
<a onclick="modifyYTiframeseektime('483')">0:08:03</a> because you'll feel  
<a onclick="modifyYTiframeseektime('484')">0:08:04</a> very very good however i do believe he  
<a onclick="modifyYTiframeseektime('486')">0:08:06</a> goes too far i'm more of a nutritarian  
<a onclick="modifyYTiframeseektime('488')">0:08:08</a> like a joel furman where he gives you a  
<a onclick="modifyYTiframeseektime('490')">0:08:10</a> little more allowance of fat and meat  
<a onclick="modifyYTiframeseektime('493')">0:08:13</a> i think you should have meat once a day  
<a onclick="modifyYTiframeseektime('496')">0:08:16</a> if you're very active even once a week  
<a onclick="modifyYTiframeseektime('497')">0:08:17</a> from once a day to once but once a day  
<a onclick="modifyYTiframeseektime('499')">0:08:19</a> is too much even i think way too much  
<a onclick="modifyYTiframeseektime('501')">0:08:21</a> and if you eat meat should be like a  
<a onclick="modifyYTiframeseektime('502')">0:08:22</a> deck of cards not more  
<a onclick="modifyYTiframeseektime('504')">0:08:24</a> we eat too much animal products now look  
<a onclick="modifyYTiframeseektime('506')">0:08:26</a> my favorite thing to eat and for me is  
<a onclick="modifyYTiframeseektime('508')">0:08:28</a> steak so sometimes i make myself a nice  
<a onclick="modifyYTiframeseektime('510')">0:08:30</a> juicy steak i treat myself once in a  
<a onclick="modifyYTiframeseektime('512')">0:08:32</a> while  
<a onclick="modifyYTiframeseektime('513')">0:08:33</a> but you got to start equating steak with  
<a onclick="modifyYTiframeseektime('516')">0:08:36</a> like smoking would you do it every day  
<a onclick="modifyYTiframeseektime('518')">0:08:38</a> no i would do three times a day no like  
<a onclick="modifyYTiframeseektime('520')">0:08:40</a> be careful with eating meat it's not  
<a onclick="modifyYTiframeseektime('521')">0:08:41</a> healthy long term now a great example of  
<a onclick="modifyYTiframeseektime('524')">0:08:44</a> this is the okinawans the okinawans are  
<a onclick="modifyYTiframeseektime('526')">0:08:46</a> mainly vegan they eat sweet potato rice  
<a onclick="modifyYTiframeseektime('528')">0:08:48</a> vegetable and they eat fresh foods once  
<a onclick="modifyYTiframeseektime('531')">0:08:51</a> a month  
<a onclick="modifyYTiframeseektime('534')">0:08:54</a> so  
<a onclick="modifyYTiframeseektime('535')">0:08:55</a> how do we know all this well we observe  
<a onclick="modifyYTiframeseektime('538')">0:08:58</a> different uh different uh cultures how  
<a onclick="modifyYTiframeseektime('540')">0:09:00</a> they ate  
<a onclick="modifyYTiframeseektime('542')">0:09:02</a> like for instance the the inuits they  
<a onclick="modifyYTiframeseektime('544')">0:09:04</a> only eat fish  
<a onclick="modifyYTiframeseektime('546')">0:09:06</a> the age the the past in the united  
<a onclick="modifyYTiframeseektime('548')">0:09:08</a> states of the past today they have more  
<a onclick="modifyYTiframeseektime('549')">0:09:09</a> modern foods okay but  
<a onclick="modifyYTiframeseektime('550')">0:09:10</a> back in the day they used to eat mostly  
<a onclick="modifyYTiframeseektime('552')">0:09:12</a> fish you know they live in the arctic  
<a onclick="modifyYTiframeseektime('554')">0:09:14</a> yeah there's no uh grains there's no  
<a onclick="modifyYTiframeseektime('556')">0:09:16</a> vegetables good point here they never  
<a onclick="modifyYTiframeseektime('558')">0:09:18</a> die of heart disease because they're  
<a onclick="modifyYTiframeseektime('559')">0:09:19</a> eating fish but they die of cancer  
<a onclick="modifyYTiframeseektime('562')">0:09:22</a> so we know that too much eating  
<a onclick="modifyYTiframeseektime('565')">0:09:25</a> flesh foods can lead to cancer again  
<a onclick="modifyYTiframeseektime('567')">0:09:27</a> there's always more elements there's  
<a onclick="modifyYTiframeseektime('568')">0:09:28</a> always more to the story it's always  
<a onclick="modifyYTiframeseektime('570')">0:09:30</a> more complicated however there is a  
<a onclick="modifyYTiframeseektime('571')">0:09:31</a> there is a correlation between eating  
<a onclick="modifyYTiframeseektime('573')">0:09:33</a> fresh foods  
<a onclick="modifyYTiframeseektime('575')">0:09:35</a> and cancer  
<a onclick="modifyYTiframeseektime('577')">0:09:37</a> so and and many other ailments so i  
<a onclick="modifyYTiframeseektime('578')">0:09:38</a> would tell you that personally from my  
<a onclick="modifyYTiframeseektime('581')">0:09:41</a> researches and studying this for so many  
<a onclick="modifyYTiframeseektime('582')">0:09:42</a> years i would tell you that  
<a onclick="modifyYTiframeseektime('586')">0:09:46</a> i'm not vegan because i think also  
<a onclick="modifyYTiframeseektime('587')">0:09:47</a> veganism will lead to problems yeah  
<a onclick="modifyYTiframeseektime('590')">0:09:50</a> vitamin deficiency problems yeah calcium  
<a onclick="modifyYTiframeseektime('592')">0:09:52</a> deficiency  
<a onclick="modifyYTiframeseektime('593')">0:09:53</a> loss of muscle okay they try to say no  
<a onclick="modifyYTiframeseektime('595')">0:09:55</a> you don't need it i don't i've i believe  
<a onclick="modifyYTiframeseektime('597')">0:09:57</a> you lose muscle i would love to debate  
<a onclick="modifyYTiframeseektime('598')">0:09:58</a> somebody who who says it different  
<a onclick="modifyYTiframeseektime('600')">0:10:00</a> because you can get your proteins on a  
<a onclick="modifyYTiframeseektime('602')">0:10:02</a> plant diet but it's hard it's difficult  
<a onclick="modifyYTiframeseektime('604')">0:10:04</a> most people won't do it right it's  
<a onclick="modifyYTiframeseektime('606')">0:10:06</a> complicated that's my point it's complex  
<a onclick="modifyYTiframeseektime('608')">0:10:08</a> vegan diet you have to you have to be  
<a onclick="modifyYTiframeseektime('609')">0:10:09</a> you have to know so much about  
<a onclick="modifyYTiframeseektime('611')">0:10:11</a> everything it's very complicated so i  
<a onclick="modifyYTiframeseektime('613')">0:10:13</a> don't recommend it but i recommend  
<a onclick="modifyYTiframeseektime('616')">0:10:16</a> because you see when the animal eats  
<a onclick="modifyYTiframeseektime('617')">0:10:17</a> certain nutrients and you eat that  
<a onclick="modifyYTiframeseektime('619')">0:10:19</a> animal you get those nutrients  
<a onclick="modifyYTiframeseektime('622')">0:10:22</a> make it simple just eat a serving of  
<a onclick="modifyYTiframeseektime('624')">0:10:24</a> meat two to three times a week and again  
<a onclick="modifyYTiframeseektime('626')">0:10:26</a> it can vary some people will do better  
<a onclick="modifyYTiframeseektime('628')">0:10:28</a> on one portion of meat a week some  
<a onclick="modifyYTiframeseektime('630')">0:10:30</a> people do better on one portion of meat  
<a onclick="modifyYTiframeseektime('632')">0:10:32</a> per month you have to experiment  
<a onclick="modifyYTiframeseektime('634')">0:10:34</a> so me when i feel my best is when i have  
<a onclick="modifyYTiframeseektime('637')">0:10:37</a> meat let's say three times a week and  
<a onclick="modifyYTiframeseektime('638')">0:10:38</a> i'm talking about small portions of meat  
<a onclick="modifyYTiframeseektime('640')">0:10:40</a> that's when i'm feeling my best i feel  
<a onclick="modifyYTiframeseektime('641')">0:10:41</a> the most energy i feel the most active i  
<a onclick="modifyYTiframeseektime('643')">0:10:43</a> feel the most lean i feel the most  
<a onclick="modifyYTiframeseektime('645')">0:10:45</a> vibrant  
<a onclick="modifyYTiframeseektime('646')">0:10:46</a> so  
<a onclick="modifyYTiframeseektime('647')">0:10:47</a> there's a lot to say with cutting out  
<a onclick="modifyYTiframeseektime('649')">0:10:49</a> animal products but people are so  
<a onclick="modifyYTiframeseektime('651')">0:10:51</a> conditioned that if they don't eat  
<a onclick="modifyYTiframeseektime('652')">0:10:52</a> animal products something bad is going  
<a onclick="modifyYTiframeseektime('653')">0:10:53</a> to happen it's not true it's actually  
<a onclick="modifyYTiframeseektime('655')">0:10:55</a> the opposite when you lower your animal  
<a onclick="modifyYTiframeseektime('656')">0:10:56</a> products  
<a onclick="modifyYTiframeseektime('658')">0:10:58</a> your cardio will go up your well-being  
<a onclick="modifyYTiframeseektime('660')">0:11:00</a> will go up your energy will go up  
<a onclick="modifyYTiframeseektime('661')">0:11:01</a> everything will go up you don't need so  
<a onclick="modifyYTiframeseektime('664')">0:11:04</a> much flesh food  
<a onclick="modifyYTiframeseektime('667')">0:11:07</a> and so so okay you've kind of alluded to  
<a onclick="modifyYTiframeseektime('670')">0:11:10</a> the fact that going vegan sometimes is i  
<a onclick="modifyYTiframeseektime('673')">0:11:13</a> mean maybe i'm reading this wrong but  
<a onclick="modifyYTiframeseektime('674')">0:11:14</a> being being vegan sometimes is a good  
<a onclick="modifyYTiframeseektime('676')">0:11:16</a> thing  
<a onclick="modifyYTiframeseektime('677')">0:11:17</a> but you've also said that we need meat  
<a onclick="modifyYTiframeseektime('679')">0:11:19</a> so how would you play it so you got 52  
<a onclick="modifyYTiframeseektime('680')">0:11:20</a> weeks in a year  
<a onclick="modifyYTiframeseektime('682')">0:11:22</a> you got 365 days do you do it in such a  
<a onclick="modifyYTiframeseektime('684')">0:11:24</a> way that okay like your one week on one  
<a onclick="modifyYTiframeseektime('686')">0:11:26</a> week off or how do you how would you  
<a onclick="modifyYTiframeseektime('687')">0:11:27</a> play it i would i would recommend people  
<a onclick="modifyYTiframeseektime('689')">0:11:29</a> try eating meat if you eat meat every  
<a onclick="modifyYTiframeseektime('691')">0:11:31</a> day yeah try to even eat three three

<a onclick="modifyYTiframeseektime('801')">0:13:21</a> dinner i'll probably do something like  
<a onclick="modifyYTiframeseektime('803')">0:13:23</a> uh it'll be very similar to lunch it'll  
<a onclick="modifyYTiframeseektime('805')">0:13:25</a> be a  
<a onclick="modifyYTiframeseektime('806')">0:13:26</a> pasta or or

<a onclick="modifyYTiframeseektime('814')">0:13:34</a> fruit low as well and i do a lot of  
<a onclick="modifyYTiframeseektime('817')">0:13:37</a> lentils sometimes i'll make hummus with  
<a onclick="modifyYTiframeseektime('819')">0:13:39</a> bread hummus and bread it's vegan it's  
<a onclick="modifyYTiframeseektime('821')">0:13:41</a> good if you have that right so that's it  
<a onclick="modifyYTiframeseektime('822')">0:13:42</a> that's enough and sometimes i don't even  
<a onclick="modifyYTiframeseektime('824')">0:13:44</a> eat dinner when i want to lose weight i  
<a onclick="modifyYTiframeseektime('826')">0:13:46</a> don't even eat dinner i'll eat from ten  
<a onclick="modifyYTiframeseektime('827')">0:13:47</a> to six  
<a onclick="modifyYTiframeseektime('828')">0:13:48</a> so for me i go to practice after six so  
<a onclick="modifyYTiframeseektime('830')">0:13:50</a> after training there's no there's no  
<a onclick="modifyYTiframeseektime('832')">0:13:52</a> meal after i drink water and go to bed  
<a onclick="modifyYTiframeseektime('833')">0:13:53</a> that's it  
<a onclick="modifyYTiframeseektime('835')">0:13:55</a> and so do you have only three meals a  
<a onclick="modifyYTiframeseektime('836')">0:13:56</a> day  
<a onclick="modifyYTiframeseektime('838')">0:13:58</a> um  
<a onclick="modifyYTiframeseektime('839')">0:13:59</a> i eat about three meals a day with with  
<a onclick="modifyYTiframeseektime('841')">0:14:01</a> a few snacks but in a window small  
<a onclick="modifyYTiframeseektime('843')">0:14:03</a> window and i think people have to learn  
<a onclick="modifyYTiframeseektime('844')">0:14:04</a> to skip meals okay tell us about  
<a onclick="modifyYTiframeseektime('847')">0:14:07</a> intermittent fasting because this is a  
<a onclick="modifyYTiframeseektime('848')">0:14:08</a> big thing for you isn't it intermittent  
<a onclick="modifyYTiframeseektime('850')">0:14:10</a> fasting is huge if you want to keep your  
<a onclick="modifyYTiframeseektime('851')">0:14:11</a> youth yeah intermittent fasting is  
<a onclick="modifyYTiframeseektime('853')">0:14:13</a> massive what is it first of all for  
<a onclick="modifyYTiframeseektime('855')">0:14:15</a> those of you intermittent fasting is  
<a onclick="modifyYTiframeseektime('859')">0:14:19</a> it's hard to define because you could  
<a onclick="modifyYTiframeseektime('860')">0:14:20</a> say look i fast it for 12 hours is that  
<a onclick="modifyYTiframeseektime('862')">0:14:22</a> intimate fasting yes but a very a very  
<a onclick="modifyYTiframeseektime('864')">0:14:24</a> beginner level so i always tell people  
<a onclick="modifyYTiframeseektime('866')">0:14:26</a> look try to eat from nine to nine  
<a onclick="modifyYTiframeseektime('868')">0:14:28</a> then from nine am to eight  
<a onclick="modifyYTiframeseektime('870')">0:14:30</a> from nine to seven and slowly because it  
<a onclick="modifyYTiframeseektime('872')">0:14:32</a> gets easier  
<a onclick="modifyYTiframeseektime('873')">0:14:33</a> then all of a sudden you're eating from  
<a onclick="modifyYTiframeseektime('875')">0:14:35</a> nine to six and you're full after six  
<a onclick="modifyYTiframeseektime('876')">0:14:36</a> you don't want to eat anymore what are  
<a onclick="modifyYTiframeseektime('877')">0:14:37</a> the benefits of that when you don't eat  
<a onclick="modifyYTiframeseektime('880')">0:14:40</a> for at least 16 hours  
<a onclick="modifyYTiframeseektime('882')">0:14:42</a> about 16 hours now this is a  
<a onclick="modifyYTiframeseektime('883')">0:14:43</a> guesstimation okay it's not exactly the  
<a onclick="modifyYTiframeseektime('884')">0:14:44</a> 16 hours for everybody depending on how  
<a onclick="modifyYTiframeseektime('886')">0:14:46</a> how how much you exercise how much you  
<a onclick="modifyYTiframeseektime('888')">0:14:48</a> ate the day before et cetera but  
<a onclick="modifyYTiframeseektime('889')">0:14:49</a> approximately 16 hours we know that a  
<a onclick="modifyYTiframeseektime('891')">0:14:51</a> phenomenon now we that they call  
<a onclick="modifyYTiframeseektime('893')">0:14:53</a> autophagy the nobel prize was given for  
<a onclick="modifyYTiframeseektime('895')">0:14:55</a> this discovery in 2016. so it's a  
<a onclick="modifyYTiframeseektime('898')">0:14:58</a> scientific fact autophagy is a greek

<a onclick="modifyYTiframeseektime('922')">0:15:22</a> and those are the cells that are toxic  
<a onclick="modifyYTiframeseektime('924')">0:15:24</a> cancerous etc i'm relying on the work of  
<a onclick="modifyYTiframeseektime('926')">0:15:26</a> jason fong okay i'm not a biologist here  
<a onclick="modifyYTiframeseektime('928')">0:15:28</a> but jason's fund's work uh the  
<a onclick="modifyYTiframeseektime('931')">0:15:31</a> all you need to know about fasting he  
<a onclick="modifyYTiframeseektime('932')">0:15:32</a> goes into it he has a great book called

<a onclick="modifyYTiframeseektime('935')">0:15:35</a> has a few books on fasting and uh he  
<a onclick="modifyYTiframeseektime('938')">0:15:38</a> talks about how his claim not mine that  
<a onclick="modifyYTiframeseektime('940')">0:15:40</a> even fasting combats cancer  
<a onclick="modifyYTiframeseektime('943')">0:15:43</a> and for this reason for autophagy again  
<a onclick="modifyYTiframeseektime('945')">0:15:45</a> if you want to get into the specifics  
<a onclick="modifyYTiframeseektime('946')">0:15:46</a> you have to rely on his work he's a  
<a onclick="modifyYTiframeseektime('948')">0:15:48</a> doctor out of toronto he's the one who  
<a onclick="modifyYTiframeseektime('949')">0:15:49</a> helped georgetown pierre uh

<a onclick="modifyYTiframeseektime('955')">0:15:55</a> using drugs just using fasting  
<a onclick="modifyYTiframeseektime('957')">0:15:57</a> and he did it successfully  
<a onclick="modifyYTiframeseektime('959')">0:15:59</a> and uh many of us started fasting after  
<a onclick="modifyYTiframeseektime('961')">0:16:01</a> that as well and we saw a huge benefit  
<a onclick="modifyYTiframeseektime('963')">0:16:03</a> that of course we fast because we're  
<a onclick="modifyYTiframeseektime('964')">0:16:04</a> muslim since we're young  
<a onclick="modifyYTiframeseektime('966')">0:16:06</a> but  
<a onclick="modifyYTiframeseektime('967')">0:16:07</a> doing fasting throughout the year also  
<a onclick="modifyYTiframeseektime('968')">0:16:08</a> has major benefits and i feel that um  
<a onclick="modifyYTiframeseektime('972')">0:16:12</a> it's something that's  
<a onclick="modifyYTiframeseektime('973')">0:16:13</a> very very beneficial even for your  
<a onclick="modifyYTiframeseektime('975')">0:16:15</a> hormones  
<a onclick="modifyYTiframeseektime('976')">0:16:16</a> however i think again it should be  
<a onclick="modifyYTiframeseektime('977')">0:16:17</a> gradual and there's two you can go too  
<a onclick="modifyYTiframeseektime('979')">0:16:19</a> far you can fast for too long and make  
<a onclick="modifyYTiframeseektime('981')">0:16:21</a> yourself weak and frail we don't want to  
<a onclick="modifyYTiframeseektime('983')">0:16:23</a> fast for too long  
<a onclick="modifyYTiframeseektime('985')">0:16:25</a> 16 hours of fasting seems to be really  
<a onclick="modifyYTiframeseektime('987')">0:16:27</a> good  
<a onclick="modifyYTiframeseektime('988')">0:16:28</a> and  
<a onclick="modifyYTiframeseektime('989')">0:16:29</a> some you can experiment with 18  
<a onclick="modifyYTiframeseektime('990')">0:16:30</a> sometimes i even do one meal a day  
<a onclick="modifyYTiframeseektime('994')">0:16:34</a> like today i i we ate a meal together  
<a onclick="modifyYTiframeseektime('996')">0:16:36</a> that's my only meal for the day and last  
<a onclick="modifyYTiframeseektime('998')">0:16:38</a> time i ate was yesterday morning wow so  
<a onclick="modifyYTiframeseektime('1000')">0:16:40</a> that's it for today why because today  
<a onclick="modifyYTiframeseektime('1001')">0:16:41</a> i'm not training i'm not exercising i'm  
<a onclick="modifyYTiframeseektime('1002')">0:16:42</a> doing very little i have a wake-up call  
<a onclick="modifyYTiframeseektime('1004')">0:16:44</a> if you're training then you do what two  
<a onclick="modifyYTiframeseektime('1006')">0:16:46</a> i would i wouldn't have eaten such a  
<a onclick="modifyYTiframeseektime('1007')">0:16:47</a> large meal and i would have i would have  
<a onclick="modifyYTiframeseektime('1009')">0:16:49</a> ate throughout the day i see so it could  
<a onclick="modifyYTiframeseektime('1011')">0:16:51</a> be digested when i get to practice  
<a onclick="modifyYTiframeseektime('1013')">0:16:53</a> so look i really believe i really like  
<a onclick="modifyYTiframeseektime('1015')">0:16:55</a> this app called the fast tick  
<a onclick="modifyYTiframeseektime('1018')">0:16:58</a> f-a-s-t-i-c because it kind of gives you  
<a onclick="modifyYTiframeseektime('1021')">0:17:01</a> the road map of what your body's doing  
<a onclick="modifyYTiframeseektime('1023')">0:17:03</a> so you start fasting you click the  
<a onclick="modifyYTiframeseektime('1025')">0:17:05</a> button it tells you what phase you're in  
<a onclick="modifyYTiframeseektime('1026')">0:17:06</a> you don't get commissioned for saying no  
<a onclick="modifyYTiframeseektime('1027')">0:17:07</a> no  
<a onclick="modifyYTiframeseektime('1029')">0:17:09</a> no it's it's a great app because it kind  
<a onclick="modifyYTiframeseektime('1031')">0:17:11</a> of like  
<a onclick="modifyYTiframeseektime('1032')">0:17:12</a> it explains to you why you're feeling  
<a onclick="modifyYTiframeseektime('1033')">0:17:13</a> this way oh my god i'm feeling like this  
<a onclick="modifyYTiframeseektime('1035')">0:17:15</a> yeah don't worry wait a little bit  
<a onclick="modifyYTiframeseektime('1036')">0:17:16</a> longer your blood sugar levels are going  
<a onclick="modifyYTiframeseektime('1038')">0:17:18</a> to stabilize and it does and it's just a  
<a onclick="modifyYTiframeseektime('1040')">0:17:20</a> great way to train yourself to know the  
<a onclick="modifyYTiframeseektime('1042')">0:17:22</a> different phases of fasting and fasting  
<a onclick="modifyYTiframeseektime('1044')">0:17:24</a> the great thing about fasting can be  
<a onclick="modifyYTiframeseektime('1045')">0:17:25</a> quite addictive  
<a onclick="modifyYTiframeseektime('1046')">0:17:26</a> because if you fast long often enough  
<a onclick="modifyYTiframeseektime('1048')">0:17:28</a> you start actually to get a  
<a onclick="modifyYTiframeseektime('1050')">0:17:30</a> cognitively uh charged  
<a onclick="modifyYTiframeseektime('1053')">0:17:33</a> start being really alert really yeah  
<a onclick="modifyYTiframeseektime('1055')">0:17:35</a> yeah plato wouldn't uh  
<a onclick="modifyYTiframeseektime('1056')">0:17:36</a> uh except students that were in a fasted  
<a onclick="modifyYTiframeseektime('1058')">0:17:38</a> state  
<a onclick="modifyYTiframeseektime('1059')">0:17:39</a> because you become cognitively charged  
<a onclick="modifyYTiframeseektime('1061')">0:17:41</a> oh yeah absolutely yeah yeah you can be  
<a onclick="modifyYTiframeseektime('1064')">0:17:44</a> if you fast long enough intensely enough  
<a onclick="modifyYTiframeseektime('1066')">0:17:46</a> over a time  
<a onclick="modifyYTiframeseektime('1068')">0:17:48</a> you will have this cognitive charge it's  
<a onclick="modifyYTiframeseektime('1070')">0:17:50</a> hard to explain but it's just a mental

<a onclick="modifyYTiframeseektime('1074')">0:17:54</a> enjoyable feeling because  
<a onclick="modifyYTiframeseektime('1076')">0:17:56</a> when you when you eat all the time the  
<a onclick="modifyYTiframeseektime('1079')">0:17:59</a> blood flow goes towards the stomach it

<a onclick="modifyYTiframeseektime('1082')">0:18:02</a> there's a chain reaction but after a

<a onclick="modifyYTiframeseektime('1094')">0:18:14</a> have more energy for some people say  
<a onclick="modifyYTiframeseektime('1095')">0:18:15</a> it's the ketones because your body  
<a onclick="modifyYTiframeseektime('1096')">0:18:16</a> starts burning ketones and ketones it's  
<a onclick="modifyYTiframeseektime('1098')">0:18:18</a> almost like hey your body's starving  
<a onclick="modifyYTiframeseektime('1100')">0:18:20</a> give him the good fuel let him find  
<a onclick="modifyYTiframeseektime('1101')">0:18:21</a> resources right now you know make him  
<a onclick="modifyYTiframeseektime('1103')">0:18:23</a> super alert make him super cognitive  
<a onclick="modifyYTiframeseektime('1105')">0:18:25</a> because he  
<a onclick="modifyYTiframeseektime('1106')">0:18:26</a> again this is a narrative i'm just  
<a onclick="modifyYTiframeseektime('1108')">0:18:28</a> giving you a nerve  
<a onclick="modifyYTiframeseektime('1109')">0:18:29</a> give him the really good stuff the  
<a onclick="modifyYTiframeseektime('1110')">0:18:30</a> ketones so that he goes out in nature  
<a onclick="modifyYTiframeseektime('1112')">0:18:32</a> and finds some resources  
<a onclick="modifyYTiframeseektime('1114')">0:18:34</a> you know make him super alert uh you get  
<a onclick="modifyYTiframeseektime('1116')">0:18:36</a> this level of a heightened awareness  
<a onclick="modifyYTiframeseektime('1119')">0:18:39</a> that comes with prolonged  
<a onclick="modifyYTiframeseektime('1120')">0:18:40</a> fasting and so  
<a onclick="modifyYTiframeseektime('1123')">0:18:43</a> what breaks your fast because  
<a onclick="modifyYTiframeseektime('1125')">0:18:45</a> people might be thinking about dry fats  
<a onclick="modifyYTiframeseektime('1126')">0:18:46</a> right now that's the kind of only  
<a onclick="modifyYTiframeseektime('1128')">0:18:48</a> experience they may have had the ramadan  
<a onclick="modifyYTiframeseektime('1130')">0:18:50</a> fast for example  
<a onclick="modifyYTiframeseektime('1131')">0:18:51</a> so you're not talking about that you're  
<a onclick="modifyYTiframeseektime('1133')">0:18:53</a> what you can still drink water right  
<a onclick="modifyYTiframeseektime('1134')">0:18:54</a> yeah especially because we're training  
<a onclick="modifyYTiframeseektime('1136')">0:18:56</a> throughout the day we need water that's  
<a onclick="modifyYTiframeseektime('1137')">0:18:57</a> number one yeah two percent dehydration  
<a onclick="modifyYTiframeseektime('1139')">0:18:59</a> equals six percent loss in performance  
<a onclick="modifyYTiframeseektime('1141')">0:19:01</a> say that again two percent dehydration  
<a onclick="modifyYTiframeseektime('1144')">0:19:04</a> really  
<a onclick="modifyYTiframeseektime('1145')">0:19:05</a> equates to six percent loss in  
<a onclick="modifyYTiframeseektime('1147')">0:19:07</a> performance now this is uh this study  
<a onclick="modifyYTiframeseektime('1150')">0:19:10</a> was done on soldiers running through  
<a onclick="modifyYTiframeseektime('1151')">0:19:11</a> gauntlets they have to run shoot et  
<a onclick="modifyYTiframeseektime('1152')">0:19:12</a> cetera  
<a onclick="modifyYTiframeseektime('1153')">0:19:13</a> and they can only ethically dehydrate  
<a onclick="modifyYTiframeseektime('1155')">0:19:15</a> them two percent not more so all we have  
<a onclick="modifyYTiframeseektime('1157')">0:19:17</a> is two percent studies on two percent  
<a onclick="modifyYTiframeseektime('1159')">0:19:19</a> dehydration imagine there may be a law  
<a onclick="modifyYTiframeseektime('1161')">0:19:21</a> of diminishing returns right could be  
<a onclick="modifyYTiframeseektime('1162')">0:19:22</a> yeah  
<a onclick="modifyYTiframeseektime('1163')">0:19:23</a> but ethically they say they can only go  
<a onclick="modifyYTiframeseektime('1165')">0:19:25</a> two percent so what happens  
<a onclick="modifyYTiframeseektime('1167')">0:19:27</a> they got six percent and they say even  
<a onclick="modifyYTiframeseektime('1169')">0:19:29</a> the top of the top  
<a onclick="modifyYTiframeseektime('1171')">0:19:31</a> soldiers had a diminished  
<a onclick="modifyYTiframeseektime('1173')">0:19:33</a> ability by six percent yeah so it  
<a onclick="modifyYTiframeseektime('1175')">0:19:35</a> doesn't matter how tough you are you  
<a onclick="modifyYTiframeseektime('1176')">0:19:36</a> need hydration hydration is more  
<a onclick="modifyYTiframeseektime('1178')">0:19:38</a> important even than food you said you  
<a onclick="modifyYTiframeseektime('1179')">0:19:39</a> could also have black coffee right black  
<a onclick="modifyYTiframeseektime('1181')">0:19:41</a> coffee tea  
<a onclick="modifyYTiframeseektime('1183')">0:19:43</a> and uh water  
<a onclick="modifyYTiframeseektime('1185')">0:19:45</a> what's that no no no no milk milk will  
<a onclick="modifyYTiframeseektime('1187')">0:19:47</a> will spike your insulin so you have a  
<a onclick="modifyYTiframeseektime('1188')">0:19:48</a> java insulin response which you don't  
<a onclick="modifyYTiframeseektime('1190')">0:19:50</a> want during your fast  
<a onclick="modifyYTiframeseektime('1191')">0:19:51</a> okay now this is in relation to  
<a onclick="modifyYTiframeseektime('1194')">0:19:54</a> diet i think you've kind of covered a  
<a onclick="modifyYTiframeseektime('1196')">0:19:56</a> lot of bases there and that maybe many  
<a onclick="modifyYTiframeseektime('1198')">0:19:58</a> people will be changing their lives for  
<a onclick="modifyYTiframeseektime('1199')">0:19:59</a> the better and that's what we're really  
<a onclick="modifyYTiframeseektime('1201')">0:20:01</a> hoping for because  
<a onclick="modifyYTiframeseektime('1202')">0:20:02</a> last time we had this conversation you  
<a onclick="modifyYTiframeseektime('1204')">0:20:04</a> you spoke you gave a very  
<a onclick="modifyYTiframeseektime('1206')">0:20:06</a> very succinct piece of advice and i  
<a onclick="modifyYTiframeseektime('1208')">0:20:08</a> actually went viral i'm not sure if you  
<a onclick="modifyYTiframeseektime('1209')">0:20:09</a> know  
<a onclick="modifyYTiframeseektime('1210')">0:20:10</a> it got like 400 500 000 views or  
<a onclick="modifyYTiframeseektime('1212')">0:20:12</a> something like that just how to lose  
<a onclick="modifyYTiframeseektime('1214')">0:20:14</a> weight and  
<a onclick="modifyYTiframeseektime('1215')">0:20:15</a> people really really enjoyed it and  
<a onclick="modifyYTiframeseektime('1217')">0:20:17</a> that's why i think i started  
<a onclick="modifyYTiframeseektime('1218')">0:20:18</a> with that this time um i want to talk a  
<a onclick="modifyYTiframeseektime('1221')">0:20:21</a> bit about  
<a onclick="modifyYTiframeseektime('1222')">0:20:22</a> before we get to self-defense obviously  
<a onclick="modifyYTiframeseektime('1224')">0:20:24</a> which is your area of specialism  
<a onclick="modifyYTiframeseektime('1227')">0:20:27</a> to  
<a onclick="modifyYTiframeseektime('1228')">0:20:28</a> training more generally for people that  
<a onclick="modifyYTiframeseektime('1230')">0:20:30</a> may not necessarily be into self-defense  
<a onclick="modifyYTiframeseektime('1233')">0:20:33</a> or  
<a onclick="modifyYTiframeseektime('1234')">0:20:34</a> may have kind of weakened because of the  
<a onclick="modifyYTiframeseektime('1237')">0:20:37</a> years the wear and tear of whatever  
<a onclick="modifyYTiframeseektime('1239')">0:20:39</a> they want to get into a gym program just  
<a onclick="modifyYTiframeseektime('1241')">0:20:41</a> a normal gym program what would you  
<a onclick="modifyYTiframeseektime('1243')">0:20:43</a> recommend for a beginner  
<a onclick="modifyYTiframeseektime('1245')">0:20:45</a> i think the number one workout for just  
<a onclick="modifyYTiframeseektime('1248')">0:20:48</a> general fitness is a  
<a onclick="modifyYTiframeseektime('1251')">0:20:51</a> bag workout a punching bag workout  
<a onclick="modifyYTiframeseektime('1252')">0:20:52</a> really it's the ultimate i'll tell you  
<a onclick="modifyYTiframeseektime('1254')">0:20:54</a> why  
<a onclick="modifyYTiframeseektime('1255')">0:20:55</a> number one you're learning a skill  
<a onclick="modifyYTiframeseektime('1256')">0:20:56</a> you're learning how to throw a good  
<a onclick="modifyYTiframeseektime('1257')">0:20:57</a> punch  
<a onclick="modifyYTiframeseektime('1258')">0:20:58</a> if you get up every day and you hit the  
<a onclick="modifyYTiframeseektime('1259')">0:20:59</a> back for a few minutes before you go to  
<a onclick="modifyYTiframeseektime('1261')">0:21:01</a> work compare that to somebody who's  
<a onclick="modifyYTiframeseektime('1263')">0:21:03</a> running on a treadmill  
<a onclick="modifyYTiframeseektime('1265')">0:21:05</a> the guy hitting the bag is going to have  
<a onclick="modifyYTiframeseektime('1267')">0:21:07</a> less injury  
<a onclick="modifyYTiframeseektime('1268')">0:21:08</a> the guy running  
<a onclick="modifyYTiframeseektime('1270')">0:21:10</a> is going to have more injury yeah the  
<a onclick="modifyYTiframeseektime('1271')">0:21:11</a> guy hitting the bag is going to have  
<a onclick="modifyYTiframeseektime('1272')">0:21:12</a> less inflammation that guy running is  
<a onclick="modifyYTiframeseektime('1274')">0:21:14</a> going to have more inflammation the guy  
<a onclick="modifyYTiframeseektime('1275')">0:21:15</a> hitting the back is gonna have higher  
<a onclick="modifyYTiframeseektime('1276')">0:21:16</a> testosterone the guy running is gonna  
<a onclick="modifyYTiframeseektime('1277')">0:21:17</a> have lower testosterone like you beat  
<a onclick="modifyYTiframeseektime('1278')">0:21:18</a> him every which way plus if we ever get  
<a onclick="modifyYTiframeseektime('1280')">0:21:20</a> into an altercation he's gonna run i'm  
<a onclick="modifyYTiframeseektime('1282')">0:21:22</a> not  
<a onclick="modifyYTiframeseektime('1282')">0:21:22</a> you know what i mean like you could  
<a onclick="modifyYTiframeseektime('1283')">0:21:23</a> throw a good punch you could defend  
<a onclick="modifyYTiframeseektime('1285')">0:21:25</a> yourself you're also cultivating a skill  
<a onclick="modifyYTiframeseektime('1287')">0:21:27</a> so what i tell people is the thing is  
<a onclick="modifyYTiframeseektime('1289')">0:21:29</a> like when you run  
<a onclick="modifyYTiframeseektime('1291')">0:21:31</a> you can get overuse injuries especially  
<a onclick="modifyYTiframeseektime('1292')">0:21:32</a> if your technique is poor and most  
<a onclick="modifyYTiframeseektime('1294')">0:21:34</a> people's running technique is poor  
<a onclick="modifyYTiframeseektime('1296')">0:21:36</a> unknowingly  
<a onclick="modifyYTiframeseektime('1297')">0:21:37</a> their mechanics have been changed  
<a onclick="modifyYTiframeseektime('1298')">0:21:38</a> because they're wearing shoes  
<a onclick="modifyYTiframeseektime('1300')">0:21:40</a> if you look at barefoot runners versus  
<a onclick="modifyYTiframeseektime('1302')">0:21:42</a> people who learn to run in shoes their  
<a onclick="modifyYTiframeseektime('1303')">0:21:43</a> mechanics are different  
<a onclick="modifyYTiframeseektime('1305')">0:21:45</a> the best mechanics are those who learn  
<a onclick="modifyYTiframeseektime('1307')">0:21:47</a> how to run barefoot third world  
<a onclick="modifyYTiframeseektime('1308')">0:21:48</a> countries they're the best at the  
<a onclick="modifyYTiframeseektime('1309')">0:21:49</a> kenyans etc  
<a onclick="modifyYTiframeseektime('1312')">0:21:52</a> so because we have poor running  
<a onclick="modifyYTiframeseektime('1314')">0:21:54</a> mechanics if you run for a prolonged  
<a onclick="modifyYTiframeseektime('1315')">0:21:55</a> period of time your knee starts hurting  
<a onclick="modifyYTiframeseektime('1316')">0:21:56</a> you your hip starts hurting you i have  
<a onclick="modifyYTiframeseektime('1317')">0:21:57</a> one of my students he's an orthopedic  
<a onclick="modifyYTiframeseektime('1319')">0:21:59</a> surgeon and i asked him which sport has  
<a onclick="modifyYTiframeseektime('1320')">0:22:00</a> the most injuries he said runners  
<a onclick="modifyYTiframeseektime('1323')">0:22:03</a> runners it's incredible like they  
<a onclick="modifyYTiframeseektime('1324')">0:22:04</a> injured themselves by prolonged running  
<a onclick="modifyYTiframeseektime('1326')">0:22:06</a> over years  
<a onclick="modifyYTiframeseektime('1328')">0:22:08</a> so when you work the heavy bag but you  
<a onclick="modifyYTiframeseektime('1330')">0:22:10</a> need to do it with instruction like for  
<a onclick="modifyYTiframeseektime('1332')">0:22:12</a> example you're saying that you learn a  
<a onclick="modifyYTiframeseektime('1333')">0:22:13</a> new skill but if the person just doing  
<a onclick="modifyYTiframeseektime('1334')">0:22:14</a> on their own volition with their own  
<a onclick="modifyYTiframeseektime('1336')">0:22:16</a> devices right yeah they could be kind of  
<a onclick="modifyYTiframeseektime('1338')">0:22:18</a> reinforcing bad habits right yeah true  
<a onclick="modifyYTiframeseektime('1340')">0:22:20</a> but what's so good about our day and age  
<a onclick="modifyYTiframeseektime('1341')">0:22:21</a> is that you can easily get a digital  
<a onclick="modifyYTiframeseektime('1344')">0:22:24</a> coach  
<a onclick="modifyYTiframeseektime('1345')">0:22:25</a> go on youtube there's a thousand one  
<a onclick="modifyYTiframeseektime('1346')">0:22:26</a> tutorials how to jab how to throw right  
<a onclick="modifyYTiframeseektime('1348')">0:22:28</a> it's good that because if someone is if  
<a onclick="modifyYTiframeseektime('1349')">0:22:29</a> if someone does that say and the person  
<a onclick="modifyYTiframeseektime('1352')">0:22:32</a> is not overseeing what they're doing and  
<a onclick="modifyYTiframeseektime('1353')">0:22:33</a> then correcting them then is there still  
<a onclick="modifyYTiframeseektime('1356')">0:22:36</a> the issue of reinforcement of background  
<a onclick="modifyYTiframeseektime('1357')">0:22:37</a> i think over years look if you're  
<a onclick="modifyYTiframeseektime('1359')">0:22:39</a> looking to be a world-class boxer then  
<a onclick="modifyYTiframeseektime('1361')">0:22:41</a> yeah you need a coach yeah yeah but if  
<a onclick="modifyYTiframeseektime('1362')">0:22:42</a> you're just a layman you know if you're  
<a onclick="modifyYTiframeseektime('1363')">0:22:43</a> a regular joe learning just getting in  
<a onclick="modifyYTiframeseektime('1365')">0:22:45</a> shape i think it's more than enough a  
<a onclick="modifyYTiframeseektime('1366')">0:22:46</a> digital tutorial is plenty but what i  
<a onclick="modifyYTiframeseektime('1368')">0:22:48</a> see a lot of is a lot of people that go  
<a onclick="modifyYTiframeseektime('1370')">0:22:50</a> into personal training and get personal  
<a onclick="modifyYTiframeseektime('1371')">0:22:51</a> trainers and they do like pad work and  
<a onclick="modifyYTiframeseektime('1373')">0:22:53</a> stuff and the personal trainer is not a  
<a onclick="modifyYTiframeseektime('1376')">0:22:56</a> trained martial artist so he will teach  
<a onclick="modifyYTiframeseektime('1377')">0:22:57</a> the client  
<a onclick="modifyYTiframeseektime('1379')">0:22:59</a> a technique which is not a correct one  
<a onclick="modifyYTiframeseektime('1381')">0:23:01</a> could that be more harmful than good i  
<a onclick="modifyYTiframeseektime('1383')">0:23:03</a> think there are levels of instructors  
<a onclick="modifyYTiframeseektime('1385')">0:23:05</a> some can do more harm than good but the  
<a onclick="modifyYTiframeseektime('1386')">0:23:06</a> vast majority boxing is a known art like  
<a onclick="modifyYTiframeseektime('1388')">0:23:08</a> if you go around the world they have  
<a onclick="modifyYTiframeseektime('1389')">0:23:09</a> boxing yeah yeah and there are different  
<a onclick="modifyYTiframeseektime('1390')">0:23:10</a> levels of boxing instruction but it's  
<a onclick="modifyYTiframeseektime('1392')">0:23:12</a> fairly good yes so i would say you know  
<a onclick="modifyYTiframeseektime('1395')">0:23:15</a> find yourself a a a reputable instructor  
<a onclick="modifyYTiframeseektime('1398')">0:23:18</a> online are you saying boxing are you  
<a onclick="modifyYTiframeseektime('1399')">0:23:19</a> saying kickboxing  
<a onclick="modifyYTiframeseektime('1400')">0:23:20</a> both i would start with boxing graduate  
<a onclick="modifyYTiframeseektime('1402')">0:23:22</a> to kickboxing go to muay thai  
<a onclick="modifyYTiframeseektime('1404')">0:23:24</a> because the thing is with punching bag  
<a onclick="modifyYTiframeseektime('1405')">0:23:25</a> you can you can you don't even have to  
<a onclick="modifyYTiframeseektime('1407')">0:23:27</a> hit the bag hard let's say your  
<a onclick="modifyYTiframeseektime('1408')">0:23:28</a> shoulders are sore just kind of you can  
<a onclick="modifyYTiframeseektime('1410')">0:23:30</a> even shadow box zero impact very good  
<a onclick="modifyYTiframeseektime('1412')">0:23:32</a> cardio yep and i like to mix bag work  
<a onclick="modifyYTiframeseektime('1414')">0:23:34</a> with calisthenics right so i like to do  
<a onclick="modifyYTiframeseektime('1416')">0:23:36</a> one minute hitting the bag one minute  
<a onclick="modifyYTiframeseektime('1418')">0:23:38</a> swinging a kettlebell so i put on mma  
<a onclick="modifyYTiframeseektime('1419')">0:23:39</a> gloves so i can swing the kettlebell one  
<a onclick="modifyYTiframeseektime('1421')">0:23:41</a> minute hitting the back one minute  
<a onclick="modifyYTiframeseektime('1422')">0:23:42</a> getting ball i do that for maybe six

<a onclick="modifyYTiframeseektime('1580')">0:26:20</a> really carved a part of my my my psyche  
<a onclick="modifyYTiframeseektime('1583')">0:26:23</a> could like i needed it so much and now  
<a onclick="modifyYTiframeseektime('1585')">0:26:25</a> you've become you know what you are now

<a onclick="modifyYTiframeseektime('1592')">0:26:32</a> huge guy  
<a onclick="modifyYTiframeseektime('1595')">0:26:35</a> the guy was the the strongest arm or  
<a onclick="modifyYTiframeseektime('1598')">0:26:38</a> something like that at one point he's  
<a onclick="modifyYTiframeseektime('1600')">0:26:40</a> world champion right hand and left hand  
<a onclick="modifyYTiframeseektime('1601')">0:26:41</a> really yeah both hands at one point he  
<a onclick="modifyYTiframeseektime('1604')">0:26:44</a> you know he gone you i don't know who  
<a onclick="modifyYTiframeseektime('1605')">0:26:45</a> got on top of him you got on top of him  
<a onclick="modifyYTiframeseektime('1607')">0:26:47</a> and his arm was there and you were  
<a onclick="modifyYTiframeseektime('1609')">0:26:49</a> commenting on the videos like and if  
<a onclick="modifyYTiframeseektime('1611')">0:26:51</a> there goes the world's strongest arm  
<a onclick="modifyYTiframeseektime('1615')">0:26:55</a> and then you got him in the hill hook  
<a onclick="modifyYTiframeseektime('1617')">0:26:57</a> position isn't it yeah like yeah yeah  
<a onclick="modifyYTiframeseektime('1619')">0:26:59</a> which many people will not know what  
<a onclick="modifyYTiframeseektime('1620')">0:27:00</a> we're talking about but you obviously  
<a onclick="modifyYTiframeseektime('1622')">0:27:02</a> you have  
<a onclick="modifyYTiframeseektime('1623')">0:27:03</a> graduated from the school of danah who's  
<a onclick="modifyYTiframeseektime('1625')">0:27:05</a> like you know well known for  
<a onclick="modifyYTiframeseektime('1627')">0:27:07</a> you know legs  
<a onclick="modifyYTiframeseektime('1629')">0:27:09</a> and it's just so amazing to be honest  
<a onclick="modifyYTiframeseektime('1631')">0:27:11</a> for me anyway  
<a onclick="modifyYTiframeseektime('1632')">0:27:12</a> to be able to see that someone who if it  
<a onclick="modifyYTiframeseektime('1635')">0:27:15</a> was a boxing affair and both were like  
<a onclick="modifyYTiframeseektime('1638')">0:27:18</a> it wouldn't be the same but because  
<a onclick="modifyYTiframeseektime('1640')">0:27:20</a> you're able to get the weakest part to  
<a onclick="modifyYTiframeseektime('1642')">0:27:22</a> use dana has language right the weakest  
<a onclick="modifyYTiframeseektime('1644')">0:27:24</a> part of the opponent's body and the  
<a onclick="modifyYTiframeseektime('1645')">0:27:25</a> strongest part of your own  
<a onclick="modifyYTiframeseektime('1647')">0:27:27</a> you're able to get someone who could be  
<a onclick="modifyYTiframeseektime('1649')">0:27:29</a> almost double your size in terms of  
<a onclick="modifyYTiframeseektime('1651')">0:27:31</a> weight i don't know how you had at least  
<a onclick="modifyYTiframeseektime('1652')">0:27:32</a> 100 pounds on you or something like that  
<a onclick="modifyYTiframeseektime('1654')">0:27:34</a> into a position of  
<a onclick="modifyYTiframeseektime('1656')">0:27:36</a> subordination  
<a onclick="modifyYTiframeseektime('1658')">0:27:38</a> you know i mean if i tried to arm  
<a onclick="modifyYTiframeseektime('1660')">0:27:40</a> wrestle him he'd rip my arm out of out  
<a onclick="modifyYTiframeseektime('1661')">0:27:41</a> of the socket like he's so much stronger  
<a onclick="modifyYTiframeseektime('1663')">0:27:43</a> than me like we play arm wrestle then i  
<a onclick="modifyYTiframeseektime('1665')">0:27:45</a> could just see like his hand i feel like  
<a onclick="modifyYTiframeseektime('1666')">0:27:46</a> a child you know i'm holding a no but  
<a onclick="modifyYTiframeseektime('1668')">0:27:48</a> that's the point that someone's so  
<a onclick="modifyYTiframeseektime('1669')">0:27:49</a> strong he's incredible his power is  
<a onclick="modifyYTiframeseektime('1671')">0:27:51</a> incredible his physical look during that  
<a onclick="modifyYTiframeseektime('1673')">0:27:53</a> time i i as we first started resting i  
<a onclick="modifyYTiframeseektime('1675')">0:27:55</a> went on his back and i couldn't put my  
<a onclick="modifyYTiframeseektime('1677')">0:27:57</a> legs around his back and he was grabbing  
<a onclick="modifyYTiframeseektime('1679')">0:27:59</a> my arm and i knew like like i understood  
<a onclick="modifyYTiframeseektime('1681')">0:28:01</a> right away what submission i have to get  
<a onclick="modifyYTiframeseektime('1683')">0:28:03</a> to i have to isolate his ankle and get  
<a onclick="modifyYTiframeseektime('1685')">0:28:05</a> to that ankle and you didn't think about  
<a onclick="modifyYTiframeseektime('1686')">0:28:06</a> any other moves no i i think it's i  
<a onclick="modifyYTiframeseektime('1689')">0:28:09</a> think it would be  
<a onclick="modifyYTiframeseektime('1691')">0:28:11</a> every other submission is very risky  
<a onclick="modifyYTiframeseektime('1693')">0:28:13</a> very risky for me  
<a onclick="modifyYTiframeseektime('1695')">0:28:15</a> and the the leg lock is the one that's  
<a onclick="modifyYTiframeseektime('1698')">0:28:18</a> super super almost impossible for him to  
<a onclick="modifyYTiframeseektime('1700')">0:28:20</a> defend and super easy for me to access  
<a onclick="modifyYTiframeseektime('1703')">0:28:23</a> so it's it's because the thing is the  
<a onclick="modifyYTiframeseektime('1705')">0:28:25</a> bigger they are the easier they are to  
<a onclick="modifyYTiframeseektime('1706')">0:28:26</a> leg lock you have you can have much more  
<a onclick="modifyYTiframeseektime('1708')">0:28:28</a> trouble leg locking somebody your size  
<a onclick="modifyYTiframeseektime('1709')">0:28:29</a> than somebody who's much bigger because  
<a onclick="modifyYTiframeseektime('1711')">0:28:31</a> the foot is this big it's such an easy  
<a onclick="modifyYTiframeseektime('1713')">0:28:33</a> lever for me to hook on to whereas the  
<a onclick="modifyYTiframeseektime('1715')">0:28:35</a> guy has a size a normal size foot it's  
<a onclick="modifyYTiframeseektime('1717')">0:28:37</a> very hard so someone's like myself what  
<a onclick="modifyYTiframeseektime('1718')">0:28:38</a> should i do to avoid my  
<a onclick="modifyYTiframeseektime('1720')">0:28:40</a> [Laughter]  
<a onclick="modifyYTiframeseektime('1721')">0:28:41</a> you know what i'm going for forever  
<a onclick="modifyYTiframeseektime('1728')">0:28:48</a> don't let the guy get there so you see  
<a onclick="modifyYTiframeseektime('1730')">0:28:50</a> like uh like as we're engaging trying to  
<a onclick="modifyYTiframeseektime('1733')">0:28:53</a> lift him would be ludicrous so because  
<a onclick="modifyYTiframeseektime('1735')">0:28:55</a> he's so tall it's easy for me to slide  
<a onclick="modifyYTiframeseektime('1736')">0:28:56</a> underneath so into a minority or  
<a onclick="modifyYTiframeseektime('1738')">0:28:58</a> something like that yeah yeah but  
<a onclick="modifyYTiframeseektime('1739')">0:28:59</a> actually i didn't use a minority i used  
<a onclick="modifyYTiframeseektime('1740')">0:29:00</a> this ashy slide which is a slide  
<a onclick="modifyYTiframeseektime('1742')">0:29:02</a> underneath straight into a leg lock so  
<a onclick="modifyYTiframeseektime('1744')">0:29:04</a> there's no resistance there's no there's  
<a onclick="modifyYTiframeseektime('1746')">0:29:06</a> no lifting there's no there's no i'm not  
<a onclick="modifyYTiframeseektime('1748')">0:29:08</a> exposing my neck because you know when  
<a onclick="modifyYTiframeseektime('1749')">0:29:09</a> you shoot a double leg you're exposing  
<a onclick="modifyYTiframeseektime('1750')">0:29:10</a> your neck  
<a onclick="modifyYTiframeseektime('1751')">0:29:11</a> like there's just so many dangers if he  
<a onclick="modifyYTiframeseektime('1752')">0:29:12</a> puts his weight on he could hurt my back  
<a onclick="modifyYTiframeseektime('1754')">0:29:14</a> so  
<a onclick="modifyYTiframeseektime('1755')">0:29:15</a> it's you have to ask yourself what is  
<a onclick="modifyYTiframeseektime('1757')">0:29:17</a> the  
<a onclick="modifyYTiframeseektime('1758')">0:29:18</a> what is the easiest way for me to attack  
<a onclick="modifyYTiframeseektime('1761')">0:29:21</a> him from safety a position of safety and  
<a onclick="modifyYTiframeseektime('1763')">0:29:23</a> it's for in that situation not all  
<a onclick="modifyYTiframeseektime('1765')">0:29:25</a> not all situations are the same if i was  
<a onclick="modifyYTiframeseektime('1767')">0:29:27</a> fighting somebody my size i would use  
<a onclick="modifyYTiframeseektime('1768')">0:29:28</a> different tactics oh is it yeah yeah  
<a onclick="modifyYTiframeseektime('1770')">0:29:30</a> absolutely because he's so tall it's  
<a onclick="modifyYTiframeseektime('1772')">0:29:32</a> very he's very vulnerable for an ashy  
<a onclick="modifyYTiframeseektime('1773')">0:29:33</a> slide  
<a onclick="modifyYTiframeseektime('1774')">0:29:34</a> so what should he do then just so i know  
<a onclick="modifyYTiframeseektime('1777')">0:29:37</a> for reference  
<a onclick="modifyYTiframeseektime('1780')">0:29:40</a> he's gotta not let me get  
<a onclick="modifyYTiframeseektime('1782')">0:29:42</a> like he he'd have to he'd have to  
<a onclick="modifyYTiframeseektime('1785')">0:29:45</a> he'd have to control my grip so that i  
<a onclick="modifyYTiframeseektime('1786')">0:29:46</a> cannot actually slide which would be  
<a onclick="modifyYTiframeseektime('1788')">0:29:48</a> complicated to explain okay okay you  
<a onclick="modifyYTiframeseektime('1790')">0:29:50</a> have to fight my grip so that i cannot  
<a onclick="modifyYTiframeseektime('1791')">0:29:51</a> grab him in a way that i can actually  
<a onclick="modifyYTiframeseektime('1793')">0:29:53</a> slide but then there's other things i  
<a onclick="modifyYTiframeseektime('1794')">0:29:54</a> can do if he if he does that you know  
<a onclick="modifyYTiframeseektime('1796')">0:29:56</a> it's a we're playing chess you know yeah  
<a onclick="modifyYTiframeseektime('1798')">0:29:58</a> and of course he's being a great sport  
<a onclick="modifyYTiframeseektime('1799')">0:29:59</a> you know he's uh he's we're just playing  
<a onclick="modifyYTiframeseektime('1801')">0:30:01</a> obviously i'm not going super hard he's  
<a onclick="modifyYTiframeseektime('1802')">0:30:02</a> not going super cool but we're still  
<a onclick="modifyYTiframeseektime('1803')">0:30:03</a> we're still getting nevertheless we're

<a onclick="modifyYTiframeseektime('1806')">0:30:06</a> just to give people a kind of a taste of  
<a onclick="modifyYTiframeseektime('1808')">0:30:08</a> this because people look at the heel  
<a onclick="modifyYTiframeseektime('1810')">0:30:10</a> hook that might and they don't know what  
<a onclick="modifyYTiframeseektime('1811')">0:30:11</a> the ramifications of it are the  
<a onclick="modifyYTiframeseektime('1813')">0:30:13</a> implications are if you finish it and if  
<a onclick="modifyYTiframeseektime('1815')">0:30:15</a> there's nobody to stop it you're  
<a onclick="modifyYTiframeseektime('1816')">0:30:16</a> destroying the man for life you're  
<a onclick="modifyYTiframeseektime('1818')">0:30:18</a> breaking the case irreversible damage  
<a onclick="modifyYTiframeseektime('1820')">0:30:20</a> right it's very dangerous on the knee  
<a onclick="modifyYTiframeseektime('1821')">0:30:21</a> like it's you could you can have it  
<a onclick="modifyYTiframeseektime('1823')">0:30:23</a> repaired but your knee might never be  
<a onclick="modifyYTiframeseektime('1824')">0:30:24</a> the same either you know so yeah it's uh  
<a onclick="modifyYTiframeseektime('1826')">0:30:26</a> it's a nasty some promotions actually  
<a onclick="modifyYTiframeseektime('1828')">0:30:28</a> had banned the heel hook right  
<a onclick="modifyYTiframeseektime('1830')">0:30:30</a> in all of ibjf heel hooks are illegal  
<a onclick="modifyYTiframeseektime('1832')">0:30:32</a> yeah until very recently in nogi and in  
<a onclick="modifyYTiframeseektime('1835')">0:30:35</a> the higher divisions only brown on black  
<a onclick="modifyYTiframeseektime('1836')">0:30:36</a> or something yeah brown and black but  
<a onclick="modifyYTiframeseektime('1837')">0:30:37</a> yeah but for many years it was frowned  
<a onclick="modifyYTiframeseektime('1839')">0:30:39</a> upon because it's considered so  
<a onclick="modifyYTiframeseektime('1840')">0:30:40</a> dangerous yeah  
<a onclick="modifyYTiframeseektime('1842')">0:30:42</a> and you can injure something the thing  
<a onclick="modifyYTiframeseektime('1843')">0:30:43</a> is when you injure your knee it's funny  
<a onclick="modifyYTiframeseektime('1844')">0:30:44</a> because i actually just released a video  
<a onclick="modifyYTiframeseektime('1847')">0:30:47</a> called strong and stable for life yeah  
<a onclick="modifyYTiframeseektime('1849')">0:30:49</a> and strong and stable needs for life and  
<a onclick="modifyYTiframeseektime('1851')">0:30:51</a> the reason why i did it is because  
<a onclick="modifyYTiframeseektime('1852')">0:30:52</a> that's the number one question i get all  
<a onclick="modifyYTiframeseektime('1853')">0:30:53</a> the time so i'm like you know what  
<a onclick="modifyYTiframeseektime('1855')">0:30:55</a> i'm gonna do it because well i'm on the  
<a onclick="modifyYTiframeseektime('1856')">0:30:56</a> mats i always have somebody tap me on  
<a onclick="modifyYTiframeseektime('1857')">0:30:57</a> the shoulder and tell me hey coach i  
<a onclick="modifyYTiframeseektime('1859')">0:30:59</a> have a knee injury what do i do i heard  
<a onclick="modifyYTiframeseektime('1860')">0:31:00</a> you  
<a onclick="modifyYTiframeseektime('1862')">0:31:02</a> you're you know you can fix my knee and  
<a onclick="modifyYTiframeseektime('1864')">0:31:04</a> then i go through the whole spiel oh as  
<a onclick="modifyYTiframeseektime('1866')">0:31:06</a> i said you know what let me put it on  
<a onclick="modifyYTiframeseektime('1867')">0:31:07</a> tape got that on your channel yeah let  
<a onclick="modifyYTiframeseektime('1868')">0:31:08</a> me let me get it on tape and now from  
<a onclick="modifyYTiframeseektime('1870')">0:31:10</a> now on i'm just going to give it to my  
<a onclick="modifyYTiframeseektime('1871')">0:31:11</a> members is it is it on the dude  
<a onclick="modifyYTiframeseektime('1875')">0:31:15</a> it's uh knees are so important because  
<a onclick="modifyYTiframeseektime('1877')">0:31:17</a> here's the problem with knees  
<a onclick="modifyYTiframeseektime('1878')">0:31:18</a> if you injure your knee like a serious  
<a onclick="modifyYTiframeseektime('1880')">0:31:20</a> injury like an acl tear yep on average  
<a onclick="modifyYTiframeseektime('1882')">0:31:22</a> two years later the other acl goes  
<a onclick="modifyYTiframeseektime('1885')">0:31:25</a> why they explain they explain to us that  
<a onclick="modifyYTiframeseektime('1887')">0:31:27</a> your your body overcompensates one side  
<a onclick="modifyYTiframeseektime('1890')">0:31:30</a> so what happens you never recalibrate  
<a onclick="modifyYTiframeseektime('1892')">0:31:32</a> your joint your legs like they were  
<a onclick="modifyYTiframeseektime('1894')">0:31:34</a> before so for instance if i injure  
<a onclick="modifyYTiframeseektime('1896')">0:31:36</a> my shoulder i can go under the knife  
<a onclick="modifyYTiframeseektime('1898')">0:31:38</a> but that doesn't affect my left shoulder  
<a onclick="modifyYTiframeseektime('1900')">0:31:40</a> yeah if i injure my right doesn't affect  
<a onclick="modifyYTiframeseektime('1901')">0:31:41</a> my left but when it comes to the knees  
<a onclick="modifyYTiframeseektime('1903')">0:31:43</a> because your knees your legs are  
<a onclick="modifyYTiframeseektime('1904')">0:31:44</a> carrying your body they have a certain  
<a onclick="modifyYTiframeseektime('1906')">0:31:46</a> calibration between the two when you  
<a onclick="modifyYTiframeseektime('1908')">0:31:48</a> injure one the other one takes over so  
<a onclick="modifyYTiframeseektime('1909')">0:31:49</a> what happens you're overusing the one  
<a onclick="modifyYTiframeseektime('1910')">0:31:50</a> that's compensating  
<a onclick="modifyYTiframeseektime('1912')">0:31:52</a> so on average there's a tariff the  
<a onclick="modifyYTiframeseektime('1914')">0:31:54</a> second one now when george tore his acl  
<a onclick="modifyYTiframeseektime('1916')">0:31:56</a> we knew about this they warned us we  
<a onclick="modifyYTiframeseektime('1917')">0:31:57</a> brought in every expert to make sure  
<a onclick="modifyYTiframeseektime('1919')">0:31:59</a> that his acl the second one doesn't  
<a onclick="modifyYTiframeseektime('1921')">0:32:01</a> break because it costs us a pretty penny  
<a onclick="modifyYTiframeseektime('1924')">0:32:04</a> and he's in the height of his career now  
<a onclick="modifyYTiframeseektime('1925')">0:32:05</a> we want to you know keep him as healthy  
<a onclick="modifyYTiframeseektime('1927')">0:32:07</a> as possible  
<a onclick="modifyYTiframeseektime('1928')">0:32:08</a> still it broke  
<a onclick="modifyYTiframeseektime('1929')">0:32:09</a> and it broke the second acl broke and it  
<a onclick="modifyYTiframeseektime('1931')">0:32:11</a> wasn't like a very intense wrestling he  
<a onclick="modifyYTiframeseektime('1934')">0:32:14</a> wasn't wrestling like usual  
<a onclick="modifyYTiframeseektime('1936')">0:32:16</a> but his knee failed and it was a scary  
<a onclick="modifyYTiframeseektime('1938')">0:32:18</a> thing because now he broke a trust with  
<a onclick="modifyYTiframeseektime('1940')">0:32:20</a> his knees like he doesn't trust his  
<a onclick="modifyYTiframeseektime('1941')">0:32:21</a> knees like he used to wow  
<a onclick="modifyYTiframeseektime('1944')">0:32:24</a> so we had to rebuild him physically and  
<a onclick="modifyYTiframeseektime('1945')">0:32:25</a> psychologically to retrust his knees  
<a onclick="modifyYTiframeseektime('1947')">0:32:27</a> again and he fought two world titles  
<a onclick="modifyYTiframeseektime('1949')">0:32:29</a> after that successfully  
<a onclick="modifyYTiframeseektime('1951')">0:32:31</a> but again there's a distrust with the  
<a onclick="modifyYTiframeseektime('1952')">0:32:32</a> knees because don't forget you're  
<a onclick="modifyYTiframeseektime('1953')">0:32:33</a> applying all your weight and the weight  
<a onclick="modifyYTiframeseektime('1955')">0:32:35</a> of your opponent sometimes when you lift  
<a onclick="modifyYTiframeseektime('1956')">0:32:36</a> your opponent it's your weight and his  
<a onclick="modifyYTiframeseektime('1957')">0:32:37</a> weight on your knees  
<a onclick="modifyYTiframeseektime('1959')">0:32:39</a> it's not the same thing with the  
<a onclick="modifyYTiframeseektime('1960')">0:32:40</a> shoulder you don't rely on your  
<a onclick="modifyYTiframeseektime('1961')">0:32:41</a> shoulders as much as you rely on your  
<a onclick="modifyYTiframeseektime('1963')">0:32:43</a> knees your knees are so  
<a onclick="modifyYTiframeseektime('1965')">0:32:45</a> important because of the base of your  
<a onclick="modifyYTiframeseektime('1967')">0:32:47</a> power every time you generate power  
<a onclick="modifyYTiframeseektime('1969')">0:32:49</a> whether you throw a punch  
<a onclick="modifyYTiframeseektime('1971')">0:32:51</a> you're using your legs your posterior  
<a onclick="modifyYTiframeseektime('1972')">0:32:52</a> chain it starts with the feet knees and  
<a onclick="modifyYTiframeseektime('1975')">0:32:55</a> hips and it goes up the shoulder  
<a onclick="modifyYTiframeseektime('1978')">0:32:58</a> does  
<a onclick="modifyYTiframeseektime('1979')">0:32:59</a> does definitely uh  
<a onclick="modifyYTiframeseektime('1981')">0:33:01</a> contribute to the kinetic chain however  
<a onclick="modifyYTiframeseektime('1983')">0:33:03</a> it's not as fundamental  
<a onclick="modifyYTiframeseektime('1986')">0:33:06</a> and it's not carrying as much stress  
<a onclick="modifyYTiframeseektime('1988')">0:33:08</a> and it doesn't rely we don't rely on the  
<a onclick="modifyYTiframeseektime('1990')">0:33:10</a> sensitivity of calibration my shoulders  
<a onclick="modifyYTiframeseektime('1992')">0:33:12</a> don't need to be calibrated as  
<a onclick="modifyYTiframeseektime('1993')">0:33:13</a> sensitively as my knees so all these  
<a onclick="modifyYTiframeseektime('1995')">0:33:15</a> problems i tell like i i wrestle every  
<a onclick="modifyYTiframeseektime('1997')">0:33:17</a> day twice a day i do mma doubles  
<a onclick="modifyYTiframeseektime('2000')">0:33:20</a> the most brutal sport mma yeah and i've

<a onclick="modifyYTiframeseektime('2014')">0:33:34</a> high level of stabilization work okay  
<a onclick="modifyYTiframeseektime('2017')">0:33:37</a> i use the stability ball a lot like i  
<a onclick="modifyYTiframeseektime('2019')">0:33:39</a> jump up on the stability ball i call it  
<a onclick="modifyYTiframeseektime('2020')">0:33:40</a> the forbidden exercise really yeah  
<a onclick="modifyYTiframeseektime('2022')">0:33:42</a> jumping up on the stability ball is very  
<a onclick="modifyYTiframeseektime('2024')">0:33:44</a> dangerous you fall down break your neck  
<a onclick="modifyYTiframeseektime('2025')">0:33:45</a> you got these catchphrases for

<a onclick="modifyYTiframeseektime('2037')">0:33:57</a> yeah  
<a onclick="modifyYTiframeseektime('2038')">0:33:58</a> i you know i learned that teaching

<a onclick="modifyYTiframeseektime('2041')">0:34:01</a> things is it's good for a point of

<a onclick="modifyYTiframeseektime('2050')">0:34:10</a> important it's important i want my  
<a onclick="modifyYTiframeseektime('2051')">0:34:11</a> students to know exactly what i'm  
<a onclick="modifyYTiframeseektime('2052')">0:34:12</a> pinpointing yeah and uh  
<a onclick="modifyYTiframeseektime('2055')">0:34:15</a> like i i'll jump up on a stability ball  
<a onclick="modifyYTiframeseektime('2057')">0:34:17</a> but just to demonstrate the stability  
<a onclick="modifyYTiframeseektime('2059')">0:34:19</a> i've built over the years  
<a onclick="modifyYTiframeseektime('2061')">0:34:21</a> not that i would do that as an exercise  
<a onclick="modifyYTiframeseektime('2063')">0:34:23</a> that's highly dangerous you know what  
<a onclick="modifyYTiframeseektime('2064')">0:34:24</a> what forbidden  
<a onclick="modifyYTiframeseektime('2066')">0:34:26</a> you'll break your neck i'm going to get  
<a onclick="modifyYTiframeseektime('2067')">0:34:27</a> a thousand one in the lawsuits if i you  
<a onclick="modifyYTiframeseektime('2069')">0:34:29</a> know that's why i named it that to make  
<a onclick="modifyYTiframeseektime('2070')">0:34:30</a> sure that if i'm ever in court i'm like  
<a onclick="modifyYTiframeseektime('2072')">0:34:32</a> hey i told it was forbidden  
<a onclick="modifyYTiframeseektime('2075')">0:34:35</a> and  
<a onclick="modifyYTiframeseektime('2076')">0:34:36</a> it's just to demonstrate  
<a onclick="modifyYTiframeseektime('2078')">0:34:38</a> uh  
<a onclick="modifyYTiframeseektime('2079')">0:34:39</a> stability but we don't build stability  
<a onclick="modifyYTiframeseektime('2081')">0:34:41</a> in a dangerous with a dangerous exercise  
<a onclick="modifyYTiframeseektime('2083')">0:34:43</a> we use safe exercises to build that  
<a onclick="modifyYTiframeseektime('2084')">0:34:44</a> level of stability but then to  
<a onclick="modifyYTiframeseektime('2086')">0:34:46</a> demonstrate stability okay we can do the  
<a onclick="modifyYTiframeseektime('2088')">0:34:48</a> forbidden exercise as a demonstration  
<a onclick="modifyYTiframeseektime('2090')">0:34:50</a> but stability training is huge number  
<a onclick="modifyYTiframeseektime('2092')">0:34:52</a> one is alignment number two is making  
<a onclick="modifyYTiframeseektime('2094')">0:34:54</a> sure you don't have tight muscles  
<a onclick="modifyYTiframeseektime('2096')">0:34:56</a> because tight muscles pull you out of  
<a onclick="modifyYTiframeseektime('2097')">0:34:57</a> alignment and number three is my opinion  
<a onclick="modifyYTiframeseektime('2099')">0:34:59</a> is stability that's the one thing i  
<a onclick="modifyYTiframeseektime('2100')">0:35:00</a> think that's missing from other programs  
<a onclick="modifyYTiframeseektime('2102')">0:35:02</a> i'm a big believer in cultivating far  
<a onclick="modifyYTiframeseektime('2105')">0:35:05</a> more stability than you need in your  
<a onclick="modifyYTiframeseektime('2106')">0:35:06</a> sport  
<a onclick="modifyYTiframeseektime('2108')">0:35:08</a> so the stability needed in mma is far  
<a onclick="modifyYTiframeseektime('2110')">0:35:10</a> greater than any other sport i can play  
<a onclick="modifyYTiframeseektime('2112')">0:35:12</a> basketball tennis soccer all day long  
<a onclick="modifyYTiframeseektime('2114')">0:35:14</a> i'll never hurt myself right because  
<a onclick="modifyYTiframeseektime('2116')">0:35:16</a> that's a far less amount of stability i  
<a onclick="modifyYTiframeseektime('2118')">0:35:18</a> need  
<a onclick="modifyYTiframeseektime('2119')">0:35:19</a> than in wrestling when the guy's  
<a onclick="modifyYTiframeseektime('2120')">0:35:20</a> actively trying to throw you on the  
<a onclick="modifyYTiframeseektime('2121')">0:35:21</a> ground and the guy's actively trying to  
<a onclick="modifyYTiframeseektime('2123')">0:35:23</a> break my leg he's not it's not i broke  
<a onclick="modifyYTiframeseektime('2124')">0:35:24</a> my leg kicking a ball no no the guy's  
<a onclick="modifyYTiframeseektime('2125')">0:35:25</a> trying to grab my leg and twist my knee  
<a onclick="modifyYTiframeseektime('2127')">0:35:27</a> off that's i need a tremendous amount of  
<a onclick="modifyYTiframeseektime('2129')">0:35:29</a> know-how and stability and  
<a onclick="modifyYTiframeseektime('2131')">0:35:31</a> uh  
<a onclick="modifyYTiframeseektime('2132')">0:35:32</a> and athleticism to to keep my knee from  
<a onclick="modifyYTiframeseektime('2135')">0:35:35</a> breaking so it's it's a far more  
<a onclick="modifyYTiframeseektime('2136')">0:35:36</a> dangerous sport i just had one of my  
<a onclick="modifyYTiframeseektime('2138')">0:35:38</a> fighters uh kevin lee he fought in the

<a onclick="modifyYTiframeseektime('2147')">0:35:47</a> the first round  
<a onclick="modifyYTiframeseektime('2149')">0:35:49</a> broke his acl one kick  
<a onclick="modifyYTiframeseektime('2151')">0:35:51</a> he fought the rest of the fight on one  
<a onclick="modifyYTiframeseektime('2152')">0:35:52</a> leg basically wobbling he won the fight  
<a onclick="modifyYTiframeseektime('2155')">0:35:55</a> did amazing but let's show you how  
<a onclick="modifyYTiframeseektime('2157')">0:35:57</a> dangerous the support we have

<a onclick="modifyYTiframeseektime('2180')">0:36:20</a> they jump  
<a onclick="modifyYTiframeseektime('2182')">0:36:22</a> they've measured the landing force is

<a onclick="modifyYTiframeseektime('2185')">0:36:25</a> weight yeah  
<a onclick="modifyYTiframeseektime('2187')">0:36:27</a> gymnastics can be very dangerous  
<a onclick="modifyYTiframeseektime('2189')">0:36:29</a> of course they're very intelligent  
<a onclick="modifyYTiframeseektime('2190')">0:36:30</a> trainers i i have a high regard for  
<a onclick="modifyYTiframeseektime('2192')">0:36:32</a> gymnastics i i actually use gymnastics a  
<a onclick="modifyYTiframeseektime('2193')">0:36:33</a> lot in my program i'm the one who put  
<a onclick="modifyYTiframeseektime('2196')">0:36:36</a> georgie appear in gymnastics i'm a big  
<a onclick="modifyYTiframeseektime('2197')">0:36:37</a> believer in gymnastics training  
<a onclick="modifyYTiframeseektime('2199')">0:36:39</a> they figured it out they figured out the  
<a onclick="modifyYTiframeseektime('2200')">0:36:40</a> body how to make it you you decided  
<a onclick="modifyYTiframeseektime('2202')">0:36:42</a> because you see the famous you know  
<a onclick="modifyYTiframeseektime('2204')">0:36:44</a> videos of him yeah i put him onto  
<a onclick="modifyYTiframeseektime('2205')">0:36:45</a> gymnastics really yeah absolutely yeah  
<a onclick="modifyYTiframeseektime('2207')">0:36:47</a> definitely  
<a onclick="modifyYTiframeseektime('2208')">0:36:48</a> they've understood the body more than  
<a onclick="modifyYTiframeseektime('2209')">0:36:49</a> anybody else  
<a onclick="modifyYTiframeseektime('2211')">0:36:51</a> when they dismount or they do certain  
<a onclick="modifyYTiframeseektime('2213')">0:36:53</a> jumps they've measured one imagine 20  
<a onclick="modifyYTiframeseektime('2216')">0:36:56</a> times your body nobody could squat 20  
<a onclick="modifyYTiframeseektime('2218')">0:36:58</a> times their body weight doesn't exist  
<a onclick="modifyYTiframeseektime('2219')">0:36:59</a> but they go up to  
<a onclick="modifyYTiframeseektime('2221')">0:37:01</a> levels of up to 20 times because they're  
<a onclick="modifyYTiframeseektime('2223')">0:37:03</a> they're spinning and crashing towards  
<a onclick="modifyYTiframeseektime('2225')">0:37:05</a> the ground that's probably the most  
<a onclick="modifyYTiframeseektime('2225')">0:37:05</a> dangerous sport  
<a onclick="modifyYTiframeseektime('2228')">0:37:08</a> because they do it on mats etc and they  
<a onclick="modifyYTiframeseektime('2230')">0:37:10</a> know how to control the the landings  
<a onclick="modifyYTiframeseektime('2232')">0:37:12</a> they're brilliant athletes no doubt  
<a onclick="modifyYTiframeseektime('2234')">0:37:14</a> um is it the most dangerous sport no i  
<a onclick="modifyYTiframeseektime('2236')">0:37:16</a> wouldn't say it's the most dangerous  
<a onclick="modifyYTiframeseektime('2237')">0:37:17</a> sport because it's more controlled than  
<a onclick="modifyYTiframeseektime('2239')">0:37:19</a> let's say football football in my  
<a onclick="modifyYTiframeseektime('2240')">0:37:20</a> opinion is probably the rugby and  
<a onclick="modifyYTiframeseektime('2242')">0:37:22</a> football in my opinion is crazy is very  
<a onclick="modifyYTiframeseektime('2244')">0:37:24</a> dangerous i gotta i i assume they're all  
<a onclick="modifyYTiframeseektime('2246')">0:37:26</a> on on peds because the brutality of that  
<a onclick="modifyYTiframeseektime('2249')">0:37:29</a> sport you know every every play  
<a onclick="modifyYTiframeseektime('2251')">0:37:31</a> they crash into each other every play  
<a onclick="modifyYTiframeseektime('2253')">0:37:33</a> the most recent cte studies that have  
<a onclick="modifyYTiframeseektime('2256')">0:37:36</a> been done as usually done in the context  
<a onclick="modifyYTiframeseektime('2258')">0:37:38</a> of american football right and this  
<a onclick="modifyYTiframeseektime('2261')">0:37:41</a> i've i saw something or heard something  
<a onclick="modifyYTiframeseektime('2263')">0:37:43</a> where by  
<a onclick="modifyYTiframeseektime('2264')">0:37:44</a> i think i actually might have been joe  
<a onclick="modifyYTiframeseektime('2265')">0:37:45</a> rogan he was saying  
<a onclick="modifyYTiframeseektime('2267')">0:37:47</a> what he was saying that basically even  
<a onclick="modifyYTiframeseektime('2268')">0:37:48</a> if you just do a year of american  
<a onclick="modifyYTiframeseektime('2270')">0:37:50</a> football in  
<a onclick="modifyYTiframeseektime('2272')">0:37:52</a> in school or college or whatever they  
<a onclick="modifyYTiframeseektime('2274')">0:37:54</a> call it in america  
<a onclick="modifyYTiframeseektime('2275')">0:37:55</a> because we call college something else  
<a onclick="modifyYTiframeseektime('2277')">0:37:57</a> university is  
<a onclick="modifyYTiframeseektime('2279')">0:37:59</a> their idea of college i think but um  
<a onclick="modifyYTiframeseektime('2281')">0:38:01</a> college whatever if they spend one year  
<a onclick="modifyYTiframeseektime('2283')">0:38:03</a> of doing that they can develop cte which  
<a onclick="modifyYTiframeseektime('2286')">0:38:06</a> i think is only detectable through  
<a onclick="modifyYTiframeseektime('2287')">0:38:07</a> autopsies i'm not sure i'm not sure  
<a onclick="modifyYTiframeseektime('2289')">0:38:09</a> actually but they're saying that so  
<a onclick="modifyYTiframeseektime('2292')">0:38:12</a> from that angle right i mean because  
<a onclick="modifyYTiframeseektime('2293')">0:38:13</a> smashing and all those kind of things  
<a onclick="modifyYTiframeseektime('2295')">0:38:15</a> into uh it's a brutal sport it's brutal  
<a onclick="modifyYTiframeseektime('2297')">0:38:17</a> there's no weight class you can put your  
<a onclick="modifyYTiframeseektime('2298')">0:38:18</a> kids into that yourself no i wouldn't  
<a onclick="modifyYTiframeseektime('2299')">0:38:19</a> put my kids in football look you can get  
<a onclick="modifyYTiframeseektime('2301')">0:38:21</a> hit by a guy who's 70 pounds heavier  
<a onclick="modifyYTiframeseektime('2302')">0:38:22</a> than you it's part of the game you could  
<a onclick="modifyYTiframeseektime('2304')">0:38:24</a> be running at you at full speed yeah and  
<a onclick="modifyYTiframeseektime('2306')">0:38:26</a> he can hit you without you seeing him  
<a onclick="modifyYTiframeseektime('2308')">0:38:28</a> you're you're here breaking a tackle  
<a onclick="modifyYTiframeseektime('2309')">0:38:29</a> he's hitting you in this direction it's  
<a onclick="modifyYTiframeseektime('2310')">0:38:30</a> a brutal sport i've seen tackles that  
<a onclick="modifyYTiframeseektime('2312')">0:38:32</a> were brutal so you would say mma  
<a onclick="modifyYTiframeseektime('2314')">0:38:34</a> comparatively is less dangerous  
<a onclick="modifyYTiframeseektime('2316')">0:38:36</a> yeah in terms of injuries sustained and  
<a onclick="modifyYTiframeseektime('2318')">0:38:38</a> stuff uh i would i would say  
<a onclick="modifyYTiframeseektime('2320')">0:38:40</a> it's as dangerous because also don't  
<a onclick="modifyYTiframeseektime('2322')">0:38:42</a> forget a knee to the head a kick to the  
<a onclick="modifyYTiframeseektime('2323')">0:38:43</a> head a shin to the head is this is  
<a onclick="modifyYTiframeseektime('2325')">0:38:45</a> brutal too yeah so i would tell you  
<a onclick="modifyYTiframeseektime('2327')">0:38:47</a> football rugby mma i would say they're  
<a onclick="modifyYTiframeseektime('2328')">0:38:48</a> on par okay because believe me a flying  
<a onclick="modifyYTiframeseektime('2331')">0:38:51</a> knee to the head while you're shooting a  
<a onclick="modifyYTiframeseektime('2332')">0:38:52</a> double could be disastrous as well  
<a onclick="modifyYTiframeseektime('2334')">0:38:54</a> you could literally break the facial  
<a onclick="modifyYTiframeseektime('2336')">0:38:56</a> structure the skull  
<a onclick="modifyYTiframeseektime('2337')">0:38:57</a> you know it's unfortunate but i've seen  
<a onclick="modifyYTiframeseektime('2339')">0:38:59</a> it but with your own kids then so would  
<a onclick="modifyYTiframeseektime('2340')">0:39:00</a> you  
<a onclick="modifyYTiframeseektime('2341')">0:39:01</a> what would you want them to be like  
<a onclick="modifyYTiframeseektime('2343')">0:39:03</a> would you want them to be  
<a onclick="modifyYTiframeseektime('2344')">0:39:04</a> would you would you push them in a  
<a onclick="modifyYTiframeseektime('2345')">0:39:05</a> particular direction would you want them  
<a onclick="modifyYTiframeseektime('2347')">0:39:07</a> to eat because you've said it before i  
<a onclick="modifyYTiframeseektime('2348')">0:39:08</a> think that you'd want them to be black  
<a onclick="modifyYTiframeseektime('2350')">0:39:10</a> belts in jiu jitsu yeah at the very  
<a onclick="modifyYTiframeseektime('2352')">0:39:12</a> minimum would you want them to stay in  
<a onclick="modifyYTiframeseektime('2353')">0:39:13</a> something like grappling to us to avoid  
<a onclick="modifyYTiframeseektime('2356')">0:39:16</a> the impact on the head yeah yeah that's  
<a onclick="modifyYTiframeseektime('2359')">0:39:19</a> definitely like i want no impact on the  
<a onclick="modifyYTiframeseektime('2360')">0:39:20</a> head till they're adult they're finished  
<a onclick="modifyYTiframeseektime('2361')">0:39:21</a> developing and then if they're really  
<a onclick="modifyYTiframeseektime('2363')">0:39:23</a> passionate about it i want them to learn  
<a onclick="modifyYTiframeseektime('2365')">0:39:25</a> kickboxing boxing and jiu jitsu no doubt  
<a onclick="modifyYTiframeseektime('2367')">0:39:27</a> yeah because they live with me it's so  
<a onclick="modifyYTiframeseektime('2368')">0:39:28</a> easy for them to get the black belt in  
<a onclick="modifyYTiframeseektime('2370')">0:39:30</a> in that way they have such an advantage  
<a onclick="modifyYTiframeseektime('2371')">0:39:31</a> why not take it like and i feel that jiu  
<a onclick="modifyYTiframeseektime('2373')">0:39:33</a> jitsu will prepare them for life you  
<a onclick="modifyYTiframeseektime('2374')">0:39:34</a> know teach them to work hard and think  
<a onclick="modifyYTiframeseektime('2377')">0:39:37</a> just you have to work hard you have to  
<a onclick="modifyYTiframeseektime('2378')">0:39:38</a> be smart you can't be a brutish and you  
<a onclick="modifyYTiframeseektime('2379')">0:39:39</a> can't just be smart you have to have  
<a onclick="modifyYTiframeseektime('2380')">0:39:40</a> both you're not an intellectual living  
<a onclick="modifyYTiframeseektime('2383')">0:39:43</a> behind a book and you're not a guy who's  
<a onclick="modifyYTiframeseektime('2384')">0:39:44</a> just lifting weights and getting strong  
<a onclick="modifyYTiframeseektime('2385')">0:39:45</a> no no you're you're the two  
<a onclick="modifyYTiframeseektime('2387')">0:39:47</a> jiu jitsu is like it's chess it's body  
<a onclick="modifyYTiframeseektime('2389')">0:39:49</a> chest so you're developing the body the  
<a onclick="modifyYTiframeseektime('2391')">0:39:51</a> mind it's a beautiful thing i really  
<a onclick="modifyYTiframeseektime('2392')">0:39:52</a> enjoy that system so i want them to be  
<a onclick="modifyYTiframeseektime('2394')">0:39:54</a> black belts and jiu jitsu master the  
<a onclick="modifyYTiframeseektime('2396')">0:39:56</a> striking arts and then decide if you  
<a onclick="modifyYTiframeseektime('2398')">0:39:58</a> want to fight  
<a onclick="modifyYTiframeseektime('2399')">0:39:59</a> it could be a bonus but i would be happy  
<a onclick="modifyYTiframeseektime('2400')">0:40:00</a> if my kids were doctors professionals uh  
<a onclick="modifyYTiframeseektime('2403')">0:40:03</a> some you know pursue academia would make  
<a onclick="modifyYTiframeseektime('2405')">0:40:05</a> me equally happy however i'd want them  
<a onclick="modifyYTiframeseektime('2407')">0:40:07</a> to be able to defend themselves for me  
<a onclick="modifyYTiframeseektime('2408')">0:40:08</a> it's very important  
<a onclick="modifyYTiframeseektime('2410')">0:40:10</a> yeah because this is this is obviously a  
<a onclick="modifyYTiframeseektime('2412')">0:40:12</a> tension between like like the mma stuff  
<a onclick="modifyYTiframeseektime('2415')">0:40:15</a> and the islamic stuff in particular  
<a onclick="modifyYTiframeseektime('2417')">0:40:17</a> because there is a very famous hadith of  
<a onclick="modifyYTiframeseektime('2419')">0:40:19</a> the prophet where he says  
<a onclick="modifyYTiframeseektime('2424')">0:40:24</a> if you it's very interesting actually if  
<a onclick="modifyYTiframeseektime('2426')">0:40:26</a> if if you're fighting with your brother  
<a onclick="modifyYTiframeseektime('2428')">0:40:28</a> then you know be careful of the face  
<a onclick="modifyYTiframeseektime('2431')">0:40:31</a> because allah has created adam on his  
<a onclick="modifyYTiframeseektime('2433')">0:40:33</a> own image  
<a onclick="modifyYTiframeseektime('2434')">0:40:34</a> so  
<a onclick="modifyYTiframeseektime('2435')">0:40:35</a> the idea being that in training  
<a onclick="modifyYTiframeseektime('2437')">0:40:37</a> environments and i think this you are a  
<a onclick="modifyYTiframeseektime('2438')">0:40:38</a> pro proponent of a low level don't break  
<a onclick="modifyYTiframeseektime('2441')">0:40:41</a> your  
<a onclick="modifyYTiframeseektime('2442')">0:40:42</a> your jaw in the gym or don't lose your  
<a onclick="modifyYTiframeseektime('2444')">0:40:44</a> your jaw in the gym or your chin in the  
<a onclick="modifyYTiframeseektime('2446')">0:40:46</a> gym  
<a onclick="modifyYTiframeseektime('2447')">0:40:47</a> um  
<a onclick="modifyYTiframeseektime('2448')">0:40:48</a> kind of thing where you're smashing your  
<a onclick="modifyYTiframeseektime('2449')">0:40:49</a> head all the time  
<a onclick="modifyYTiframeseektime('2451')">0:40:51</a> now science is telling us cte and all  
<a onclick="modifyYTiframeseektime('2453')">0:40:53</a> that kind of thing as well  
<a onclick="modifyYTiframeseektime('2454')">0:40:54</a> um it because the thing is if you have  
<a onclick="modifyYTiframeseektime('2456')">0:40:56</a> an intellectual pursuit  
<a onclick="modifyYTiframeseektime('2458')">0:40:58</a> which i think  
<a onclick="modifyYTiframeseektime('2459')">0:40:59</a> like for example in the community we  
<a onclick="modifyYTiframeseektime('2461')">0:41:01</a> would want our people to have  
<a onclick="modifyYTiframeseektime('2462')">0:41:02</a> intellectual pursuits but you also have  
<a onclick="modifyYTiframeseektime('2464')">0:41:04</a> a physical pursuit you wouldn't want  
<a onclick="modifyYTiframeseektime('2466')">0:41:06</a> those two things to kind of work  
<a onclick="modifyYTiframeseektime('2468')">0:41:08</a> against one against one another and so a  
<a onclick="modifyYTiframeseektime('2471')">0:41:11</a> heavy like so for me i mean i i've told  
<a onclick="modifyYTiframeseektime('2474')">0:41:14</a> you already like i've got my kids in bjj  
<a onclick="modifyYTiframeseektime('2477')">0:41:17</a> and i'm like focusing on grappling with  
<a onclick="modifyYTiframeseektime('2479')">0:41:19</a> them but i do realize i see the very  
<a onclick="modifyYTiframeseektime('2482')">0:41:22</a> important  
<a onclick="modifyYTiframeseektime('2484')">0:41:24</a> uh need for striking and i understand  
<a onclick="modifyYTiframeseektime('2486')">0:41:26</a> also to get to develop that martial  
<a onclick="modifyYTiframeseektime('2488')">0:41:28</a> literacy you need to do some sparring  
<a onclick="modifyYTiframeseektime('2490')">0:41:30</a> but if you do inspiring with someone who  
<a onclick="modifyYTiframeseektime('2492')">0:41:32</a> wants to take your head off every time  
<a onclick="modifyYTiframeseektime('2494')">0:41:34</a> then there's an issue here as well isn't  
<a onclick="modifyYTiframeseektime('2496')">0:41:36</a> that they can you know ev every gym has  
<a onclick="modifyYTiframeseektime('2498')">0:41:38</a> this culture what's the culture of  
<a onclick="modifyYTiframeseektime('2499')">0:41:39</a> tristar then culture is controlled  
<a onclick="modifyYTiframeseektime('2501')">0:41:41</a> because we have classes called touch  
<a onclick="modifyYTiframeseektime('2502')">0:41:42</a> sparring classes where there's no hard  
<a onclick="modifyYTiframeseektime('2504')">0:41:44</a> hard shots just play spark and then  
<a onclick="modifyYTiframeseektime('2506')">0:41:46</a> after you develop a certain ability to  
<a onclick="modifyYTiframeseektime('2508')">0:41:48</a> move  
<a onclick="modifyYTiframeseektime('2509')">0:41:49</a> then we invite you to the more robust  
<a onclick="modifyYTiframeseektime('2511')">0:41:51</a> sparrings yes and those robust sparrings  
<a onclick="modifyYTiframeseektime('2513')">0:41:53</a> are limited two times a week and for  
<a onclick="modifyYTiframeseektime('2515')">0:41:55</a> training camp and they're done they're  
<a onclick="modifyYTiframeseektime('2517')">0:41:57</a> done more sparingly  
<a onclick="modifyYTiframeseektime('2519')">0:41:59</a> and even then there's a control even  
<a onclick="modifyYTiframeseektime('2521')">0:42:01</a> then so so you would then you wouldn't  
<a onclick="modifyYTiframeseektime('2523')">0:42:03</a> allow like elbows and knees no  
<a onclick="modifyYTiframeseektime('2525')">0:42:05</a> only only the guys i trust the most were  
<a onclick="modifyYTiframeseektime('2527')">0:42:07</a> gonna like simulate it they're not gonna  
<a onclick="modifyYTiframeseektime('2529')">0:42:09</a> throw it for real okay the reason why  
<a onclick="modifyYTiframeseektime('2530')">0:42:10</a> you wanna build the body yes yes you  
<a onclick="modifyYTiframeseektime('2532')">0:42:12</a> don't wanna destroy the body when you go  
<a onclick="modifyYTiframeseektime('2534')">0:42:14</a> in the gym you have to build the body  
<a onclick="modifyYTiframeseektime('2535')">0:42:15</a> not destroy the body people go in the  
<a onclick="modifyYTiframeseektime('2536')">0:42:16</a> gym to destroy the body it's wrong it's  
<a onclick="modifyYTiframeseektime('2538')">0:42:18</a> the wrong way of thinking now there are  
<a onclick="modifyYTiframeseektime('2539')">0:42:19</a> two methods to  
<a onclick="modifyYTiframeseektime('2540')">0:42:20</a> build a very  
<a onclick="modifyYTiframeseektime('2542')">0:42:22</a> strong gym one you put everybody all  
<a onclick="modifyYTiframeseektime('2544')">0:42:24</a> these alpha males in one room you're in  
<a onclick="modifyYTiframeseektime('2545')">0:42:25</a> a metropolitan city where there's  
<a onclick="modifyYTiframeseektime('2546')">0:42:26</a> millions and millions of people  
<a onclick="modifyYTiframeseektime('2548')">0:42:28</a> you're flooded with guys who want to  
<a onclick="modifyYTiframeseektime('2549')">0:42:29</a> make it you put them in the room they  
<a onclick="modifyYTiframeseektime('2550')">0:42:30</a> kill each other there's one guy who  
<a onclick="modifyYTiframeseektime('2552')">0:42:32</a> survives at all and he's your champion  
<a onclick="modifyYTiframeseektime('2554')">0:42:34</a> then you have a thousand one dead bodies  
<a onclick="modifyYTiframeseektime('2556')">0:42:36</a> but you have one champion yeah  
<a onclick="modifyYTiframeseektime('2558')">0:42:38</a> and the other method is  
<a onclick="modifyYTiframeseektime('2559')">0:42:39</a> you teach each one of them how to be  
<a onclick="modifyYTiframeseektime('2561')">0:42:41</a> their best you exhaust their potential  
<a onclick="modifyYTiframeseektime('2563')">0:42:43</a> there's a you create a synergy where  
<a onclick="modifyYTiframeseektime('2564')">0:42:44</a> everybody respects everyone nobody  
<a onclick="modifyYTiframeseektime('2566')">0:42:46</a> injures the other we're here to develop  
<a onclick="modifyYTiframeseektime('2568')">0:42:48</a> our skills not kill each other and then  
<a onclick="modifyYTiframeseektime('2569')">0:42:49</a> you have a variety of of excellent  
<a onclick="modifyYTiframeseektime('2572')">0:42:52</a> fighters yeah  
<a onclick="modifyYTiframeseektime('2574')">0:42:54</a> and then from there they feed off each  
<a onclick="modifyYTiframeseektime('2575')">0:42:55</a> other because excellence breeds  
<a onclick="modifyYTiframeseektime('2577')">0:42:57</a> excellence and so on you have you got  
<a onclick="modifyYTiframeseektime('2578')">0:42:58</a> this type of synergy  
<a onclick="modifyYTiframeseektime('2580')">0:43:00</a> but many gyms are the darwinian style as  
<a onclick="modifyYTiframeseektime('2582')">0:43:02</a> if i could say you know it's killer be  
<a onclick="modifyYTiframeseektime('2584')">0:43:04</a> killed and you didn't make it too bad  
<a onclick="modifyYTiframeseektime('2585')">0:43:05</a> there's another guy waiting to take your  
<a onclick="modifyYTiframeseektime('2586')">0:43:06</a> place because we're in a very we're  
<a onclick="modifyYTiframeseektime('2587')">0:43:07</a> we're in a city where it's too  
<a onclick="modifyYTiframeseektime('2588')">0:43:08</a> jam-packed we have too many people  
<a onclick="modifyYTiframeseektime('2590')">0:43:10</a> and you got hurt there's less space on  
<a onclick="modifyYTiframeseektime('2592')">0:43:12</a> there's more space on the mat for us  
<a onclick="modifyYTiframeseektime('2594')">0:43:14</a> because there are some places where  
<a onclick="modifyYTiframeseektime('2595')">0:43:15</a> they're so full of people  
<a onclick="modifyYTiframeseektime('2598')">0:43:18</a> that they don't care if they lose a  
<a onclick="modifyYTiframeseektime('2599')">0:43:19</a> customer or not or a fighter they have  
<a onclick="modifyYTiframeseektime('2600')">0:43:20</a> another guy coming in town he wants to  
<a onclick="modifyYTiframeseektime('2602')">0:43:22</a> make it too so it all depends on what  
<a onclick="modifyYTiframeseektime('2604')">0:43:24</a> kind of atmosphere and i breed an  
<a onclick="modifyYTiframeseektime('2606')">0:43:26</a> atmosphere of building right not  
<a onclick="modifyYTiframeseektime('2609')">0:43:29</a> uh last man standing type uh atmosphere  
<a onclick="modifyYTiframeseektime('2611')">0:43:31</a> and is that i've heard i'm not sure of  
<a onclick="modifyYTiframeseektime('2613')">0:43:33</a> talks industry but for example in  
<a onclick="modifyYTiframeseektime('2615')">0:43:35</a> dagestan the way they do wrestling and  
<a onclick="modifyYTiframeseektime('2617')">0:43:37</a> stuff like that they're soft they play  
<a onclick="modifyYTiframeseektime('2620')">0:43:40</a> they're more playful yeah  
<a onclick="modifyYTiframeseektime('2621')">0:43:41</a> and do you think that's that might be a  
<a onclick="modifyYTiframeseektime('2623')">0:43:43</a> secret to their success because we're  
<a onclick="modifyYTiframeseektime('2624')">0:43:44</a> seeing the rise of  
<a onclick="modifyYTiframeseektime('2626')">0:43:46</a> i mean you've got um sagilev who's the  
<a onclick="modifyYTiframeseektime('2628')">0:43:48</a> wrestler like he's he's i'm not sure  
<a onclick="modifyYTiframeseektime('2630')">0:43:50</a> seen as pound-for-pound best freestyle  
<a onclick="modifyYTiframeseektime('2632')">0:43:52</a> wrestler in the world right now and then  
<a onclick="modifyYTiframeseektime('2634')">0:43:54</a> you've got like all these kind of  
<a onclick="modifyYTiframeseektime('2635')">0:43:55</a> fighters of khabib being notable but  
<a onclick="modifyYTiframeseektime('2638')">0:43:58</a> ankylo have done really well really well  
<a onclick="modifyYTiframeseektime('2640')">0:44:00</a> now in the light heavyweight division  
<a onclick="modifyYTiframeseektime('2642')">0:44:02</a> and other fighters as well  
<a onclick="modifyYTiframeseektime('2644')">0:44:04</a> they seem to have a real  
<a onclick="modifyYTiframeseektime('2646')">0:44:06</a> kind of pedigree  
<a onclick="modifyYTiframeseektime('2648')">0:44:08</a> and  
<a onclick="modifyYTiframeseektime('2649')">0:44:09</a> at the heart of it is grappling so is is  
<a onclick="modifyYTiframeseektime('2652')">0:44:12</a> is that because they've developed team  
<a onclick="modifyYTiframeseektime('2654')">0:44:14</a> spirit that they're all working with  
<a onclick="modifyYTiframeseektime('2656')">0:44:16</a> each other or is it because of the  
<a onclick="modifyYTiframeseektime('2657')">0:44:17</a> playful kind of training what is it  
<a onclick="modifyYTiframeseektime('2659')">0:44:19</a> really what i think is i think i think  
<a onclick="modifyYTiframeseektime('2661')">0:44:21</a> they have a  
<a onclick="modifyYTiframeseektime('2662')">0:44:22</a> they have a  
<a onclick="modifyYTiframeseektime('2664')">0:44:24</a> learn the sequences they have they have  
<a onclick="modifyYTiframeseektime('2665')">0:44:25</a> a higher regard for technique  
<a onclick="modifyYTiframeseektime('2668')">0:44:28</a> and so if you do something and you do it  
<a onclick="modifyYTiframeseektime('2670')">0:44:30</a> using force it's considered your  
<a onclick="modifyYTiframeseektime('2672')">0:44:32</a> wrestling is ugly it's not aesthetically  
<a onclick="modifyYTiframeseektime('2674')">0:44:34</a> pleasing  
<a onclick="modifyYTiframeseektime('2675')">0:44:35</a> why because if you mastered the  
<a onclick="modifyYTiframeseektime('2676')">0:44:36</a> technique and then you unleash your  
<a onclick="modifyYTiframeseektime('2677')">0:44:37</a> force you'd be even better  
<a onclick="modifyYTiframeseektime('2679')">0:44:39</a> so they they breed a culture of wow you  
<a onclick="modifyYTiframeseektime('2682')">0:44:42</a> got the technique right  
<a onclick="modifyYTiframeseektime('2684')">0:44:44</a> where in america if you do something  
<a onclick="modifyYTiframeseektime('2686')">0:44:46</a> athletic it's wow look how you bypass  
<a onclick="modifyYTiframeseektime('2688')">0:44:48</a> the system yeah yeah whereas them know  
<a onclick="modifyYTiframeseektime('2691')">0:44:51</a> do it right there's a wrong way in the  
<a onclick="modifyYTiframeseektime('2693')">0:44:53</a> right way and then demonstrate your  
<a onclick="modifyYTiframeseektime('2694')">0:44:54</a> athleticism so it's it's really the the  
<a onclick="modifyYTiframeseektime('2697')">0:44:57</a> tradition of teaching and training  
<a onclick="modifyYTiframeseektime('2698')">0:44:58</a> because not that americans are not  
<a onclick="modifyYTiframeseektime('2701')">0:45:01</a> technical they are definitely they just  
<a onclick="modifyYTiframeseektime('2703')">0:45:03</a> also have a great  
<a onclick="modifyYTiframeseektime('2705')">0:45:05</a> enjoyment to watch something athletic  
<a onclick="modifyYTiframeseektime('2707')">0:45:07</a> just something that's  
<a onclick="modifyYTiframeseektime('2708')">0:45:08</a> freaky you know the guy can jump so much  
<a onclick="modifyYTiframeseektime('2710')">0:45:10</a> or he can pull so much or what  
<a onclick="modifyYTiframeseektime('2712')">0:45:12</a> they have more they breathe more culture  
<a onclick="modifyYTiframeseektime('2714')">0:45:14</a> of do you do it right do you understand  
<a onclick="modifyYTiframeseektime('2716')">0:45:16</a> why we do it this way and if the answer  
<a onclick="modifyYTiframeseektime('2718')">0:45:18</a> is yes it's good if the answer is bad  
<a onclick="modifyYTiframeseektime('2720')">0:45:20</a> explain it to him again you know because  
<a onclick="modifyYTiframeseektime('2722')">0:45:22</a> they have this and that's why look the  
<a onclick="modifyYTiframeseektime('2723')">0:45:23</a> european wrestling there's a lot to say  
<a onclick="modifyYTiframeseektime('2725')">0:45:25</a> they have a lot more gold medals than in  
<a onclick="modifyYTiframeseektime('2727')">0:45:27</a> the west okay  
<a onclick="modifyYTiframeseektime('2728')">0:45:28</a> and also they support their athletes  
<a onclick="modifyYTiframeseektime('2730')">0:45:30</a> more their other their other factors but  
<a onclick="modifyYTiframeseektime('2731')">0:45:31</a> generally speaking most  
<a onclick="modifyYTiframeseektime('2733')">0:45:33</a> wrestling experts will tell you that  
<a onclick="modifyYTiframeseektime('2734')">0:45:34</a> they're more technical  
<a onclick="modifyYTiframeseektime('2736')">0:45:36</a> the wrestling is more it's superior  
<a onclick="modifyYTiframeseektime('2740')">0:45:40</a> does that have to do with state funding  
<a onclick="modifyYTiframeseektime('2742')">0:45:42</a> i would say yes but also the culture of  
<a onclick="modifyYTiframeseektime('2743')">0:45:43</a> learning like for instance if you look  
<a onclick="modifyYTiframeseektime('2744')">0:45:44</a> at scandinavian countries they they do  
<a onclick="modifyYTiframeseektime('2746')">0:45:46</a> really well in school even though they  
<a onclick="modifyYTiframeseektime('2748')">0:45:48</a> do less hours and less homework and they  
<a onclick="modifyYTiframeseektime('2749')">0:45:49</a> start at a later age why is that  
<a onclick="modifyYTiframeseektime('2751')">0:45:51</a> well in america if you say something  
<a onclick="modifyYTiframeseektime('2753')">0:45:53</a> like not not everywhere in america but  
<a onclick="modifyYTiframeseektime('2755')">0:45:55</a> like  
<a onclick="modifyYTiframeseektime('2757')">0:45:57</a> let's just put it this way they have a  
<a onclick="modifyYTiframeseektime('2758')">0:45:58</a> high regard for  
<a onclick="modifyYTiframeseektime('2761')">0:46:01</a> um  
<a onclick="modifyYTiframeseektime('2762')">0:46:02</a> education education is seen as a good  
<a onclick="modifyYTiframeseektime('2764')">0:46:04</a> thing it's seen it is true in america  
<a onclick="modifyYTiframeseektime('2766')">0:46:06</a> but maybe more so in scandinavian  
<a onclick="modifyYTiframeseektime('2768')">0:46:08</a> countries saying something like for  
<a onclick="modifyYTiframeseektime('2770')">0:46:10</a> instance i remember watching dr phil  
<a onclick="modifyYTiframeseektime('2773')">0:46:13</a> and there was this girl she was 16 years  
<a onclick="modifyYTiframeseektime('2774')">0:46:14</a> old and she was like  
<a onclick="modifyYTiframeseektime('2775')">0:46:15</a> getting angry at the crowd and she's  
<a onclick="modifyYTiframeseektime('2777')">0:46:17</a> like take catch me outside how about  
<a onclick="modifyYTiframeseektime('2778')">0:46:18</a> that  
<a onclick="modifyYTiframeseektime('2780')">0:46:20</a> catch me outside let's go fight outside  
<a onclick="modifyYTiframeseektime('2781')">0:46:21</a> she's saying and when she said that i  
<a onclick="modifyYTiframeseektime('2783')">0:46:23</a> didn't understand what you're saying but  
<a onclick="modifyYTiframeseektime('2783')">0:46:23</a> she became a star  
<a onclick="modifyYTiframeseektime('2785')">0:46:25</a> now in scandinavia she would be it would  
<a onclick="modifyYTiframeseektime('2787')">0:46:27</a> be frowned upon because she's doing  
<a onclick="modifyYTiframeseektime('2788')">0:46:28</a> something a behavior that's probably  
<a onclick="modifyYTiframeseektime('2790')">0:46:30</a> ignorant you know it seems like but in  
<a onclick="modifyYTiframeseektime('2791')">0:46:31</a> america they'll they'll marvel at  
<a onclick="modifyYTiframeseektime('2793')">0:46:33</a> they'll laugh about it because it's cool  
<a onclick="modifyYTiframeseektime('2795')">0:46:35</a> it's funny and she later became a  
<a onclick="modifyYTiframeseektime('2797')">0:46:37</a> millionaire she signed a 16 million  
<a onclick="modifyYTiframeseektime('2798')">0:46:38</a> dollar contract or 40 if millions of  
<a onclick="modifyYTiframeseektime('2800')">0:46:40</a> dollars to do like a music video where  
<a onclick="modifyYTiframeseektime('2802')">0:46:42</a> she's just lip singing and it's like  
<a onclick="modifyYTiframeseektime('2804')">0:46:44</a> crazy that they made her such a star why  
<a onclick="modifyYTiframeseektime('2806')">0:46:46</a> because she went on dr phil and she  
<a onclick="modifyYTiframeseektime('2808')">0:46:48</a> behaved in a certain way  
<a onclick="modifyYTiframeseektime('2809')">0:46:49</a> now in certain other cultures that would  
<a onclick="modifyYTiframeseektime('2811')">0:46:51</a> be rejected  
<a onclick="modifyYTiframeseektime('2812')">0:46:52</a> that would be frowned upon that would be  
<a onclick="modifyYTiframeseektime('2813')">0:46:53</a> embarrassing they probably wouldn't even  
<a onclick="modifyYTiframeseektime('2815')">0:46:55</a> show it on the air  
<a onclick="modifyYTiframeseektime('2816')">0:46:56</a> however in certain cultures hey it's  
<a onclick="modifyYTiframeseektime('2818')">0:46:58</a> considered cool and fun and and funny  
<a onclick="modifyYTiframeseektime('2820')">0:47:00</a> and then marvelous and whatnot so  
<a onclick="modifyYTiframeseektime('2823')">0:47:03</a> culture makes a huge difference  
<a onclick="modifyYTiframeseektime('2825')">0:47:05</a> absolutely right like you know  
<a onclick="modifyYTiframeseektime('2826')">0:47:06</a> especially in india china like  
<a onclick="modifyYTiframeseektime('2828')">0:47:08</a> why why do they  
<a onclick="modifyYTiframeseektime('2830')">0:47:10</a> excel so much over and above western  
<a onclick="modifyYTiframeseektime('2832')">0:47:12</a> countries and for example sub jobs like  
<a onclick="modifyYTiframeseektime('2834')">0:47:14</a> mathematics  
<a onclick="modifyYTiframeseektime('2836')">0:47:16</a> uh probably the same kind of reasoning  
<a onclick="modifyYTiframeseektime('2838')">0:47:18</a> the the education and the teacher gets  
<a onclick="modifyYTiframeseektime('2840')">0:47:20</a> to maintain his integrity whereas in the  
<a onclick="modifyYTiframeseektime('2842')">0:47:22</a> west the teacher is almost like a  
<a onclick="modifyYTiframeseektime('2844')">0:47:24</a> dispensable asset like you know you can  
<a onclick="modifyYTiframeseektime('2846')">0:47:26</a> just replace him if you don't like him  
<a onclick="modifyYTiframeseektime('2847')">0:47:27</a> you can vote him out or something you  
<a onclick="modifyYTiframeseektime('2848')">0:47:28</a> know i remember watching a documentary  
<a onclick="modifyYTiframeseektime('2850')">0:47:30</a> where they they sent they brought in a  
<a onclick="modifyYTiframeseektime('2852')">0:47:32</a> chinese  
<a onclick="modifyYTiframeseektime('2853')">0:47:33</a> a group of chinese teachers here to  
<a onclick="modifyYTiframeseektime('2854')">0:47:34</a> england  
<a onclick="modifyYTiframeseektime('2856')">0:47:36</a> and they separated a grade one would do  
<a onclick="modifyYTiframeseektime('2857')">0:47:37</a> the chinese system one would do  
<a onclick="modifyYTiframeseektime('2859')">0:47:39</a> the english system  
<a onclick="modifyYTiframeseektime('2861')">0:47:41</a> and the chinese teachers were like  
<a onclick="modifyYTiframeseektime('2865')">0:47:45</a> in china we don't have to discipline  
<a onclick="modifyYTiframeseektime('2866')">0:47:46</a> because they were asking the students to  
<a onclick="modifyYTiframeseektime('2868')">0:47:48</a> do a b and c and the students weren't  
<a onclick="modifyYTiframeseektime('2870')">0:47:50</a> doing it  
<a onclick="modifyYTiframeseektime('2871')">0:47:51</a> and that the chinese teachers were  
<a onclick="modifyYTiframeseektime('2872')">0:47:52</a> perplexed they were like in china we  
<a onclick="modifyYTiframeseektime('2874')">0:47:54</a> don't have to discipline they're born  
<a onclick="modifyYTiframeseektime('2875')">0:47:55</a> disciplined  
<a onclick="modifyYTiframeseektime('2876')">0:47:56</a> meaning in their culture they're raised  
<a onclick="modifyYTiframeseektime('2878')">0:47:58</a> by the time they go to school they  
<a onclick="modifyYTiframeseektime('2879')">0:47:59</a> already understand that you have to  
<a onclick="modifyYTiframeseektime('2880')">0:48:00</a> follow the rules and it's natural to  
<a onclick="modifyYTiframeseektime('2882')">0:48:02</a> them  
<a onclick="modifyYTiframeseektime('2882')">0:48:02</a> so in the west they had this different  
<a onclick="modifyYTiframeseektime('2884')">0:48:04</a> challenge where they had to they had to  
<a onclick="modifyYTiframeseektime('2887')">0:48:07</a> try to discipline the children but they  
<a onclick="modifyYTiframeseektime('2888')">0:48:08</a> had no means to they had no program for  
<a onclick="modifyYTiframeseektime('2890')">0:48:10</a> this and they were making the kids work  
<a onclick="modifyYTiframeseektime('2892')">0:48:12</a> harder longer and eventually they  
<a onclick="modifyYTiframeseektime('2894')">0:48:14</a> compared the grades and the chinese  
<a onclick="modifyYTiframeseektime('2896')">0:48:16</a> school had better grades the chinese  
<a onclick="modifyYTiframeseektime('2898')">0:48:18</a> group but then the chinese teacher said  
<a onclick="modifyYTiframeseektime('2901')">0:48:21</a> something very interesting he said look  
<a onclick="modifyYTiframeseektime('2903')">0:48:23</a> in china we have kung fu  
<a onclick="modifyYTiframeseektime('2906')">0:48:26</a> and we have pandas but we would never  
<a onclick="modifyYTiframeseektime('2908')">0:48:28</a> have kung fu panda meaning  
<a onclick="modifyYTiframeseektime('2910')">0:48:30</a> that by being so rigid they kind of kill

<a onclick="modifyYTiframeseektime('3408')">0:56:48</a> rounds we'll do five minute rounds do  
<a onclick="modifyYTiframeseektime('3409')">0:56:49</a> you ever do do you ever do full fully  
<a onclick="modifyYTiframeseektime('3411')">0:56:51</a> fledged sparring uh no no no the kids no  
<a onclick="modifyYTiframeseektime('3413')">0:56:53</a> no no no no no no just just grappling uh  
<a onclick="modifyYTiframeseektime('3415')">0:56:55</a> graphic we do body shot sparring i'm a  
<a onclick="modifyYTiframeseektime('3417')">0:56:57</a> big believer in the kyokushin style  
<a onclick="modifyYTiframeseektime('3418')">0:56:58</a> system like if you look at george grew  
<a onclick="modifyYTiframeseektime('3419')">0:56:59</a> up in that system where they kick and  
<a onclick="modifyYTiframeseektime('3421')">0:57:01</a> punch to the body really and then later  
<a onclick="modifyYTiframeseektime('3423')">0:57:03</a> as they're older they teach some  
<a onclick="modifyYTiframeseektime('3424')">0:57:04</a> striking to their head do you not think  
<a onclick="modifyYTiframeseektime('3426')">0:57:06</a> that one of the drawbacks of that system  
<a onclick="modifyYTiframeseektime('3427')">0:57:07</a> is that if you learn to punch the body  
<a onclick="modifyYTiframeseektime('3430')">0:57:10</a> and defend to the body that when you go  
<a onclick="modifyYTiframeseektime('3432')">0:57:12</a> and do sparring  
<a onclick="modifyYTiframeseektime('3433')">0:57:13</a> fully fledged that your defenses will be  
<a onclick="modifyYTiframeseektime('3435')">0:57:15</a> they quickly catch up are you sure yeah  
<a onclick="modifyYTiframeseektime('3437')">0:57:17</a> absolutely because  
<a onclick="modifyYTiframeseektime('3440')">0:57:20</a> there's many world champions in k1 that  
<a onclick="modifyYTiframeseektime('3442')">0:57:22</a> came from a karate background that had  
<a onclick="modifyYTiframeseektime('3443')">0:57:23</a> hard time early in the beginning then  
<a onclick="modifyYTiframeseektime('3445')">0:57:25</a> they adopted boxing and george is one of  
<a onclick="modifyYTiframeseektime('3446')">0:57:26</a> them george exactly like this he had a  
<a onclick="modifyYTiframeseektime('3447')">0:57:27</a> great kicking and punching to the body  
<a onclick="modifyYTiframeseektime('3449')">0:57:29</a> but no punching to the head it was very  
<a onclick="modifyYTiframeseektime('3450')">0:57:30</a> easy to hit he quickly transformed why  
<a onclick="modifyYTiframeseektime('3452')">0:57:32</a> because it's very similar  
<a onclick="modifyYTiframeseektime('3454')">0:57:34</a> and it's it's just basically you're  
<a onclick="modifyYTiframeseektime('3456')">0:57:36</a> putting the icing on the cake it's not  
<a onclick="modifyYTiframeseektime('3457')">0:57:37</a> really you're you're not building the  
<a onclick="modifyYTiframeseektime('3458')">0:57:38</a> whole idea of reflexes and distance  
<a onclick="modifyYTiframeseektime('3460')">0:57:40</a> control and the thing is because they  
<a onclick="modifyYTiframeseektime('3462')">0:57:42</a> haven't gotten hit in the head their  
<a onclick="modifyYTiframeseektime('3463')">0:57:43</a> mind is completely well developed and  
<a onclick="modifyYTiframeseektime('3465')">0:57:45</a> clear  
<a onclick="modifyYTiframeseektime('3466')">0:57:46</a> you know so i really believe in the  
<a onclick="modifyYTiframeseektime('3468')">0:57:48</a> system i think it's fantastic because  
<a onclick="modifyYTiframeseektime('3469')">0:57:49</a> you learn how to kick punch distance  
<a onclick="modifyYTiframeseektime('3471')">0:57:51</a> control and actually it's more painful  
<a onclick="modifyYTiframeseektime('3473')">0:57:53</a> to get hit in the body than the head the  
<a onclick="modifyYTiframeseektime('3474')">0:57:54</a> head you don't really feel anything and  
<a onclick="modifyYTiframeseektime('3476')">0:57:56</a> just you might see a spark here and  
<a onclick="modifyYTiframeseektime('3477')">0:57:57</a> there a star here and there but you  
<a onclick="modifyYTiframeseektime('3479')">0:57:59</a> don't feel pain like getting in the body  
<a onclick="modifyYTiframeseektime('3480')">0:58:00</a> so they're actually more resistant to  
<a onclick="modifyYTiframeseektime('3481')">0:58:01</a> pain  
<a onclick="modifyYTiframeseektime('3482')">0:58:02</a> and they're less likely to head hunt  
<a onclick="modifyYTiframeseektime('3483')">0:58:03</a> because they've been hitting the body  
<a onclick="modifyYTiframeseektime('3484')">0:58:04</a> their entire life  
<a onclick="modifyYTiframeseektime('3486')">0:58:06</a> it's a brilliant system i think it's  
<a onclick="modifyYTiframeseektime('3487')">0:58:07</a> very very good and i think  
<a onclick="modifyYTiframeseektime('3489')">0:58:09</a> well  
<a onclick="modifyYTiframeseektime('3489')">0:58:09</a> in kyokushin karate  
<a onclick="modifyYTiframeseektime('3492')">0:58:12</a> the karate system because they're they  
<a onclick="modifyYTiframeseektime('3493')">0:58:13</a> start in the youth they only attack the  
<a onclick="modifyYTiframeseektime('3495')">0:58:15</a> body even in taekwondo they just they  
<a onclick="modifyYTiframeseektime('3497')">0:58:17</a> put a shield on the body and you can hit  
<a onclick="modifyYTiframeseektime('3499')">0:58:19</a> the body as hard as you want right okay  
<a onclick="modifyYTiframeseektime('3501')">0:58:21</a> well not not every kyokushin tournament  
<a onclick="modifyYTiframeseektime('3504')">0:58:24</a> is as hard as you want they have  
<a onclick="modifyYTiframeseektime('3505')">0:58:25</a> somewhere you're not allowed to hit as  
<a onclick="modifyYTiframeseektime('3506')">0:58:26</a> hard as you want but it's very very safe  
<a onclick="modifyYTiframeseektime('3508')">0:58:28</a> for the brain like the worst you can get  
<a onclick="modifyYTiframeseektime('3510')">0:58:30</a> is  
<a onclick="modifyYTiframeseektime('3511')">0:58:31</a> really hard on the body and winded  
<a onclick="modifyYTiframeseektime('3512')">0:58:32</a> mm-hmm so basically you run out of you  
<a onclick="modifyYTiframeseektime('3514')">0:58:34</a> get dropped to your knees and you can't  
<a onclick="modifyYTiframeseektime('3515')">0:58:35</a> breathe for a second or two and it's  
<a onclick="modifyYTiframeseektime('3517')">0:58:37</a> very rare but it's nothing serious and  
<a onclick="modifyYTiframeseektime('3519')">0:58:39</a> george came from that background  
<a onclick="modifyYTiframeseektime('3520')">0:58:40</a> absolutely he became world champion  
<a onclick="modifyYTiframeseektime('3521')">0:58:41</a> that's why i'm telling people it's  
<a onclick="modifyYTiframeseektime('3522')">0:58:42</a> better to do it that way  
<a onclick="modifyYTiframeseektime('3524')">0:58:44</a> then because if you look at boxers and  
<a onclick="modifyYTiframeseektime('3526')">0:58:46</a> muay thai fighters after they're retired  
<a onclick="modifyYTiframeseektime('3528')">0:58:48</a> the ones who started very very young a  
<a onclick="modifyYTiframeseektime('3530')">0:58:50</a> lot of them unfortunately become  
<a onclick="modifyYTiframeseektime('3531')">0:58:51</a> alcoholics  
<a onclick="modifyYTiframeseektime('3532')">0:58:52</a> dysfunctional they're completely  
<a onclick="modifyYTiframeseektime('3534')">0:58:54</a> dysfunctional they can't go into society  
<a onclick="modifyYTiframeseektime('3536')">0:58:56</a> why  
<a onclick="modifyYTiframeseektime('3538')">0:58:58</a> the way that they explain it the way  
<a onclick="modifyYTiframeseektime('3539')">0:58:59</a> i've heard it to be explained is that  
<a onclick="modifyYTiframeseektime('3542')">0:59:02</a> when you get hit in the head often  
<a onclick="modifyYTiframeseektime('3544')">0:59:04</a> the brain the receptor in your brain is  
<a onclick="modifyYTiframeseektime('3546')">0:59:06</a> not as  
<a onclick="modifyYTiframeseektime('3547')">0:59:07</a> efficient it's not as sensitive so what  
<a onclick="modifyYTiframeseektime('3549')">0:59:09</a> happens  
<a onclick="modifyYTiframeseektime('3551')">0:59:11</a> if a hundred is feeling normal they're  
<a onclick="modifyYTiframeseektime('3553')">0:59:13</a> at 80.  
<a onclick="modifyYTiframeseektime('3555')">0:59:15</a> so they need a substance a self-medicate  
<a onclick="modifyYTiframeseektime('3556')">0:59:16</a> they say they take drugs or alcohol to  
<a onclick="modifyYTiframeseektime('3558')">0:59:18</a> bring them up to just a hundred just to  
<a onclick="modifyYTiframeseektime('3560')">0:59:20</a> feel normal  
<a onclick="modifyYTiframeseektime('3561')">0:59:21</a> and i don't know if this narrative is  
<a onclick="modifyYTiframeseektime('3563')">0:59:23</a> true you know i've heard experts say  
<a onclick="modifyYTiframeseektime('3565')">0:59:25</a> this but i i can't say that i have no  
<a onclick="modifyYTiframeseektime('3566')">0:59:26</a> studies  
<a onclick="modifyYTiframeseektime('3568')">0:59:28</a> explains this for a fact but  
<a onclick="modifyYTiframeseektime('3570')">0:59:30</a> i've definitely noticed a trend that  
<a onclick="modifyYTiframeseektime('3571')">0:59:31</a> ex-boxers are not functional after yeah  
<a onclick="modifyYTiframeseektime('3574')">0:59:34</a> i've seen yeah i've i've been in  
<a onclick="modifyYTiframeseektime('3575')">0:59:35</a> thailand believe me i've been i've been  
<a onclick="modifyYTiframeseektime('3577')">0:59:37</a> in the thick of it okay  
<a onclick="modifyYTiframeseektime('3578')">0:59:38</a> land they they retire like 32 or  
<a onclick="modifyYTiframeseektime('3580')">0:59:40</a> something right younger 526 yeah because  
<a onclick="modifyYTiframeseektime('3583')">0:59:43</a> it's just too much is it because they  
<a onclick="modifyYTiframeseektime('3585')">0:59:45</a> used to be on the stage and now they  
<a onclick="modifyYTiframeseektime('3586')">0:59:46</a> have they have a regular job and that's  
<a onclick="modifyYTiframeseektime('3587')">0:59:47</a> what's depressing them i don't know i  
<a onclick="modifyYTiframeseektime('3589')">0:59:49</a> can't tell you that either narrative is  
<a onclick="modifyYTiframeseektime('3590')">0:59:50</a> true i don't know for a fact i thought  
<a onclick="modifyYTiframeseektime('3592')">0:59:52</a> it was because their bodies had had  
<a onclick="modifyYTiframeseektime('3593')">0:59:53</a> enough i think it has a lot to do with  
<a onclick="modifyYTiframeseektime('3594')">0:59:54</a> blows to the head is that yeah yeah um  
<a onclick="modifyYTiframeseektime('3597')">0:59:57</a> i think excessive looks to the head  
<a onclick="modifyYTiframeseektime('3598')">0:59:58</a> don't forget they do with elbows kicks  
<a onclick="modifyYTiframeseektime('3600')">1:00:00</a> to the head it's brutal yeah that's why  
<a onclick="modifyYTiframeseektime('3602')">1:00:02</a> i'm very sensitive to that issue your  
<a onclick="modifyYTiframeseektime('3604')">1:00:04</a> brain is developing because the thing is  
<a onclick="modifyYTiframeseektime('3605')">1:00:05</a> in thailand they make them fight with  
<a onclick="modifyYTiframeseektime('3607')">1:00:07</a> elbows and knees as kids like we're  
<a onclick="modifyYTiframeseektime('3609')">1:00:09</a> talking about seven-year-old  
<a onclick="modifyYTiframeseektime('3610')">1:00:10</a> eight-year-old six years old  
<a onclick="modifyYTiframeseektime('3611')">1:00:11</a> and they make them cut weight who knows  
<a onclick="modifyYTiframeseektime('3614')">1:00:14</a> what that does to your organs and brain  
<a onclick="modifyYTiframeseektime('3615')">1:00:15</a> i don't know what it does there's no  
<a onclick="modifyYTiframeseektime('3616')">1:00:16</a> study that tells you there's no study  
<a onclick="modifyYTiframeseektime('3618')">1:00:18</a> following kids cutting weight so i think  
<a onclick="modifyYTiframeseektime('3620')">1:00:20</a> it's too much i rather my kids have a

<a onclick="modifyYTiframeseektime('3624')">1:00:24</a> developed and then i'll add them to  
<a onclick="modifyYTiframeseektime('3626')">1:00:26</a> these do you know an mma there are two  
<a onclick="modifyYTiframeseektime('3628')">1:00:28</a> kind of if you want to call them that  
<a onclick="modifyYTiframeseektime('3629')">1:00:29</a> schools of thought someone's come from a  
<a onclick="modifyYTiframeseektime('3631')">1:00:31</a> specialist background and then they  
<a onclick="modifyYTiframeseektime('3632')">1:00:32</a> learn the other two or three sports  
<a onclick="modifyYTiframeseektime('3634')">1:00:34</a> whatever they're gonna learn all  
<a onclick="modifyYTiframeseektime('3635')">1:00:35</a> together and someone who's trying to be  
<a onclick="modifyYTiframeseektime('3637')">1:00:37</a> a generalist  
<a onclick="modifyYTiframeseektime('3638')">1:00:38</a> in terms of effectiveness  
<a onclick="modifyYTiframeseektime('3640')">1:00:40</a> and general efficacy who what do you  
<a onclick="modifyYTiframeseektime('3642')">1:00:42</a> think other like where has success been  
<a onclick="modifyYTiframeseektime('3645')">1:00:45</a> more seen  
<a onclick="modifyYTiframeseektime('3646')">1:00:46</a> people that have for example freestyle  
<a onclick="modifyYTiframeseektime('3648')">1:00:48</a> wrestling backgrounds and then they come  
<a onclick="modifyYTiframeseektime('3649')">1:00:49</a> and they learn like a bit of striking  
<a onclick="modifyYTiframeseektime('3651')">1:00:51</a> and  
<a onclick="modifyYTiframeseektime('3652')">1:00:52</a> jiu-jitsu or someone who's trying to do  
<a onclick="modifyYTiframeseektime('3654')">1:00:54</a> all three at the same time um i would  
<a onclick="modifyYTiframeseektime('3656')">1:00:56</a> recommend doing wrestling and jiu jitsu  
<a onclick="modifyYTiframeseektime('3658')">1:00:58</a> first  
<a onclick="modifyYTiframeseektime('3659')">1:00:59</a> wrestling in jitsu shouldn't be  
<a onclick="modifyYTiframeseektime('3660')">1:01:00</a> separated  
<a onclick="modifyYTiframeseektime('3661')">1:01:01</a> and do that because you're gonna build  
<a onclick="modifyYTiframeseektime('3663')">1:01:03</a> an athleticism the wrestlers have a  
<a onclick="modifyYTiframeseektime('3664')">1:01:04</a> better athleticism  
<a onclick="modifyYTiframeseektime('3666')">1:01:06</a> then let's go into striking  
<a onclick="modifyYTiframeseektime('3668')">1:01:08</a> and i'll quick quick what age is always  
<a onclick="modifyYTiframeseektime('3670')">1:01:10</a> talking about here  
<a onclick="modifyYTiframeseektime('3671')">1:01:11</a> i would say look after your brain  
<a onclick="modifyYTiframeseektime('3672')">1:01:12</a> finishes developing i would teach my  
<a onclick="modifyYTiframeseektime('3674')">1:01:14</a> kids how to hit the bag earlier on like  
<a onclick="modifyYTiframeseektime('3676')">1:01:16</a> my kids they don't do a lot of striking  
<a onclick="modifyYTiframeseektime('3678')">1:01:18</a> they do a lot of wrestling in jiu jitsu  
<a onclick="modifyYTiframeseektime('3679')">1:01:19</a> and then i make them hit the back let's  
<a onclick="modifyYTiframeseektime('3680')">1:01:20</a> say once a week once every two weeks  
<a onclick="modifyYTiframeseektime('3682')">1:01:22</a> just so they can develop that  
<a onclick="modifyYTiframeseektime('3684')">1:01:24</a> coordination when they're young  
<a onclick="modifyYTiframeseektime('3685')">1:01:25</a> because we've seen world champions pick  
<a onclick="modifyYTiframeseektime('3687')">1:01:27</a> up kickboxing at the age of 14 and  
<a onclick="modifyYTiframeseektime('3689')">1:01:29</a> become world champion by the time  
<a onclick="modifyYTiframeseektime('3690')">1:01:30</a> they're 25.  
<a onclick="modifyYTiframeseektime('3691')">1:01:31</a> what happened he learned in such a short  
<a onclick="modifyYTiframeseektime('3692')">1:01:32</a> period well it doesn't take that long  
<a onclick="modifyYTiframeseektime('3695')">1:01:35</a> it's not that it takes forever to learn  
<a onclick="modifyYTiframeseektime('3696')">1:01:36</a> however  
<a onclick="modifyYTiframeseektime('3697')">1:01:37</a> jiu jitsu is complicated yeah  
<a onclick="modifyYTiframeseektime('3700')">1:01:40</a> and wrestling is there's a lot of  
<a onclick="modifyYTiframeseektime('3703')">1:01:43</a> uh possibilities whereas in kickboxing  
<a onclick="modifyYTiframeseektime('3705')">1:01:45</a> and muay thai  
<a onclick="modifyYTiframeseektime('3707')">1:01:47</a> it's more about speeding timing the  
<a onclick="modifyYTiframeseektime('3708')">1:01:48</a> possibilities are not that complicated  
<a onclick="modifyYTiframeseektime('3710')">1:01:50</a> comparatively comparatively don't forget  
<a onclick="modifyYTiframeseektime('3712')">1:01:52</a> and jiu jitsu jesus there's so many  
<a onclick="modifyYTiframeseektime('3714')">1:01:54</a> nuances there's so many positions so  
<a onclick="modifyYTiframeseektime('3715')">1:01:55</a> many things you have to learn cerebrally  
<a onclick="modifyYTiframeseektime('3718')">1:01:58</a> now boxing is also you know there's a  
<a onclick="modifyYTiframeseektime('3720')">1:02:00</a> lot of detail but nowhere near nobody  
<a onclick="modifyYTiframeseektime('3722')">1:02:02</a> can the possibilities in wrestling in  
<a onclick="modifyYTiframeseektime('3723')">1:02:03</a> jujitsu are far greater than striking  
<a onclick="modifyYTiframeseektime('3727')">1:02:07</a> i i i saw a video of john jones one time  
<a onclick="modifyYTiframeseektime('3729')">1:02:09</a> he was asking what's the most potent  
<a onclick="modifyYTiframeseektime('3732')">1:02:12</a> sport um kind of martial in the sport  
<a onclick="modifyYTiframeseektime('3734')">1:02:14</a> and he said it was freestyle wrestling  
<a onclick="modifyYTiframeseektime('3736')">1:02:16</a> to what extent do you agree that if you  
<a onclick="modifyYTiframeseektime('3737')">1:02:17</a> have a time limit i would say yeah it  
<a onclick="modifyYTiframeseektime('3739')">1:02:19</a> makes sense if there's no time limit  
<a onclick="modifyYTiframeseektime('3740')">1:02:20</a> it's jiu jitsu right because look jiu  
<a onclick="modifyYTiframeseektime('3743')">1:02:23</a> jitsu was developed in the time of vale  
<a onclick="modifyYTiframeseektime('3744')">1:02:24</a> tudor valley tutorial means anything  
<a onclick="modifyYTiframeseektime('3746')">1:02:26</a> goes me and you would fight but there's  
<a onclick="modifyYTiframeseektime('3747')">1:02:27</a> no time limit the winner gets the  
<a onclick="modifyYTiframeseektime('3748')">1:02:28</a> videotape that's how it was  
<a onclick="modifyYTiframeseektime('3750')">1:02:30</a> fights will last two three hours so what  
<a onclick="modifyYTiframeseektime('3752')">1:02:32</a> you took me down so what however if you  
<a onclick="modifyYTiframeseektime('3754')">1:02:34</a> take me down and there's only two  
<a onclick="modifyYTiframeseektime('3755')">1:02:35</a> minutes left on the clock  
<a onclick="modifyYTiframeseektime('3757')">1:02:37</a> and you just fend off my submissions and  
<a onclick="modifyYTiframeseektime('3759')">1:02:39</a> you just kind of hold me tight and you  
<a onclick="modifyYTiframeseektime('3760')">1:02:40</a> just and the bell rings they give you  
<a onclick="modifyYTiframeseektime('3762')">1:02:42</a> the round you read  
<a onclick="modifyYTiframeseektime('3764')">1:02:44</a> you repeat the process two more times  
<a onclick="modifyYTiframeseektime('3765')">1:02:45</a> and you win  
<a onclick="modifyYTiframeseektime('3766')">1:02:46</a> however that's just 15 minutes  
<a onclick="modifyYTiframeseektime('3768')">1:02:48</a> that's not a long time for two guys to  
<a onclick="modifyYTiframeseektime('3770')">1:02:50</a> find out who's a better fighter now  
<a onclick="modifyYTiframeseektime('3772')">1:02:52</a> let's say that let's say we made it  
<a onclick="modifyYTiframeseektime('3773')">1:02:53</a> unlimited rounds and the fighter the  
<a onclick="modifyYTiframeseektime('3775')">1:02:55</a> wrestler gets subbed in seventh round  
<a onclick="modifyYTiframeseektime('3777')">1:02:57</a> you'll be like oh the grappler is better  
<a onclick="modifyYTiframeseektime('3779')">1:02:59</a> yeah but you didn't get to the seventh  
<a onclick="modifyYTiframeseektime('3780')">1:03:00</a> round in competition night you only saw  
<a onclick="modifyYTiframeseektime('3782')">1:03:02</a> the first three  
<a onclick="modifyYTiframeseektime('3783')">1:03:03</a> because believe me when i tell you  
<a onclick="modifyYTiframeseektime('3785')">1:03:05</a> um  
<a onclick="modifyYTiframeseektime('3786')">1:03:06</a> the wrestlers don't have a way to end  
<a onclick="modifyYTiframeseektime('3787')">1:03:07</a> the fight often  
<a onclick="modifyYTiframeseektime('3789')">1:03:09</a> so i've seen many fights where there was  
<a onclick="modifyYTiframeseektime('3791')">1:03:11</a> no time limit and the wrestler gets  
<a onclick="modifyYTiframeseektime('3793')">1:03:13</a> subbed or knocked out or hurt because he  
<a onclick="modifyYTiframeseektime('3795')">1:03:15</a> just had no way to end the fight he can  
<a onclick="modifyYTiframeseektime('3796')">1:03:16</a> get the guy down he can't do anything  
<a onclick="modifyYTiframeseektime('3797')">1:03:17</a> about it it takes years to refine how to  
<a onclick="modifyYTiframeseektime('3799')">1:03:19</a> pass their guard mount them take their  
<a onclick="modifyYTiframeseektime('3800')">1:03:20</a> back etc  
<a onclick="modifyYTiframeseektime('3801')">1:03:21</a> so  
<a onclick="modifyYTiframeseektime('3803')">1:03:23</a> with because we've made it more of a  
<a onclick="modifyYTiframeseektime('3804')">1:03:24</a> sport it's more time sensitive i would  
<a onclick="modifyYTiframeseektime('3806')">1:03:26</a> say yes makes sense  
<a onclick="modifyYTiframeseektime('3808')">1:03:28</a> and on this point what do you think with  
<a onclick="modifyYTiframeseektime('3810')">1:03:30</a> the whole comes out hamza chameleo and  
<a onclick="modifyYTiframeseektime('3814')">1:03:34</a> burns  
<a onclick="modifyYTiframeseektime('3815')">1:03:35</a> if it becomes a grappling affair then on  
<a onclick="modifyYTiframeseektime('3817')">1:03:37</a> this analysis it should favor burns  
<a onclick="modifyYTiframeseektime('3819')">1:03:39</a> because then he could yeah but because  
<a onclick="modifyYTiframeseektime('3821')">1:03:41</a> of the time limit i don't think there's  
<a onclick="modifyYTiframeseektime('3822')">1:03:42</a> much you can do like you have to look  
<a onclick="modifyYTiframeseektime('3823')">1:03:43</a> the better the guy is the more sequences  
<a onclick="modifyYTiframeseektime('3825')">1:03:45</a> i need to trap him  
<a onclick="modifyYTiframeseektime('3827')">1:03:47</a> and the guy knows that so what he's  
<a onclick="modifyYTiframeseektime('3828')">1:03:48</a> going to stall he's going to have stall  
<a onclick="modifyYTiframeseektime('3829')">1:03:49</a> tactics he's not even going to do the  
<a onclick="modifyYTiframeseektime('3831')">1:03:51</a> sequences he knows that if he keeps  
<a onclick="modifyYTiframeseektime('3832')">1:03:52</a> breaking grips keep interrupting the  
<a onclick="modifyYTiframeseektime('3833')">1:03:53</a> sequences he can eventually kill the  
<a onclick="modifyYTiframeseektime('3836')">1:03:56</a> time so what do you think's going to  
<a onclick="modifyYTiframeseektime('3837')">1:03:57</a> happen i think comes that's going to win  
<a onclick="modifyYTiframeseektime('3838')">1:03:58</a> it's going to be a stand-up affair is it  
<a onclick="modifyYTiframeseektime('3840')">1:04:00</a> yeah i think he has the reach the power  
<a onclick="modifyYTiframeseektime('3842')">1:04:02</a> the the the distance he's assault pots  
<a onclick="modifyYTiframeseektime('3844')">1:04:04</a> and open stance it could be harder for  
<a onclick="modifyYTiframeseektime('3846')">1:04:06</a> uh bernstein he's a blue belt compared  
<a onclick="modifyYTiframeseektime('3848')">1:04:08</a> to yeah but  
<a onclick="modifyYTiframeseektime('3849')">1:04:09</a> that's that's misleading because he's  
<a onclick="modifyYTiframeseektime('3851')">1:04:11</a> been wrestling his whole life and people  
<a onclick="modifyYTiframeseektime('3852')">1:04:12</a> think wrestlers don't do ground that's  
<a onclick="modifyYTiframeseektime('3853')">1:04:13</a> not true  
<a onclick="modifyYTiframeseektime('3854')">1:04:14</a> see the fatal flaw in jiu jitsu is that  
<a onclick="modifyYTiframeseektime('3855')">1:04:15</a> they do just ground a lot of them like  
<a onclick="modifyYTiframeseektime('3857')">1:04:17</a> in my academy we do standing and we do  
<a onclick="modifyYTiframeseektime('3859')">1:04:19</a> ground  
<a onclick="modifyYTiframeseektime('3860')">1:04:20</a> wrestlers do standing and ground it's a  
<a onclick="modifyYTiframeseektime('3861')">1:04:21</a> myth that they don't it's it's not true  
<a onclick="modifyYTiframeseektime('3863')">1:04:23</a> that they do a different type of ground  
<a onclick="modifyYTiframeseektime('3865')">1:04:25</a> but it's very relevant to what we do on  
<a onclick="modifyYTiframeseektime('3867')">1:04:27</a> mma but  
<a onclick="modifyYTiframeseektime('3868')">1:04:28</a> with the difference being with um anklev  
<a onclick="modifyYTiframeseektime('3870')">1:04:30</a> and um  
<a onclick="modifyYTiframeseektime('3872')">1:04:32</a> khabib is that they did right  
<a onclick="modifyYTiframeseektime('3874')">1:04:34</a> whereas  
<a onclick="modifyYTiframeseektime('3875')">1:04:35</a> whereas whereas hamza is coming from a  
<a onclick="modifyYTiframeseektime('3876')">1:04:36</a> freestyle restaurant but freestyle they  
<a onclick="modifyYTiframeseektime('3878')">1:04:38</a> do ground  
<a onclick="modifyYTiframeseektime('3879')">1:04:39</a> yeah but they do like what you call it  
<a onclick="modifyYTiframeseektime('3881')">1:04:41</a> gut wrench etc that's plenty they do a  
<a onclick="modifyYTiframeseektime('3883')">1:04:43</a> lot of ground there is a lot of ground  
<a onclick="modifyYTiframeseektime('3885')">1:04:45</a> so they know how to control their  
<a onclick="modifyYTiframeseektime('3887')">1:04:47</a> balance they know how to hold you down  
<a onclick="modifyYTiframeseektime('3888')">1:04:48</a> from getting up i don't think it's going  
<a onclick="modifyYTiframeseektime('3890')">1:04:50</a> to be too much of a ground affair would  
<a onclick="modifyYTiframeseektime('3891')">1:04:51</a> surprise me i mean nothing's impossible  
<a onclick="modifyYTiframeseektime('3892')">1:04:52</a> but i think it's a it's a good very good  
<a onclick="modifyYTiframeseektime('3894')">1:04:54</a> hamsa it's a very good fight for him  
<a onclick="modifyYTiframeseektime('3896')">1:04:56</a> it's gonna be interesting i think if he  
<a onclick="modifyYTiframeseektime('3897')">1:04:57</a> gets through this one  
<a onclick="modifyYTiframeseektime('3898')">1:04:58</a> you know a very yeah i thought martial  
<a onclick="modifyYTiframeseektime('3900')">1:05:00</a> is a world champion or in ibj  
<a onclick="modifyYTiframeseektime('3903')">1:05:03</a> burns ah burns he is right so if he gets  
<a onclick="modifyYTiframeseektime('3905')">1:05:05</a> through him i think that would  
<a onclick="modifyYTiframeseektime('3907')">1:05:07</a> definitely mean that he's  
<a onclick="modifyYTiframeseektime('3908')">1:05:08</a> i think one of the top guys there i  
<a onclick="modifyYTiframeseektime('3910')">1:05:10</a> think the winner is going to get kobe  
<a onclick="modifyYTiframeseektime('3911')">1:05:11</a> covington  
<a onclick="modifyYTiframeseektime('3913')">1:05:13</a> hamzat or  
<a onclick="modifyYTiframeseektime('3914')">1:05:14</a> burns  
<a onclick="modifyYTiframeseektime('3915')">1:05:15</a> both of them i think either whoever wins  
<a onclick="modifyYTiframeseektime('3917')">1:05:17</a> the fight gets kobe and the winner of  
<a onclick="modifyYTiframeseektime('3918')">1:05:18</a> kobe versus  
<a onclick="modifyYTiframeseektime('3919')">1:05:19</a> kamza go back tomorrow or yeah i think  
<a onclick="modifyYTiframeseektime('3922')">1:05:22</a> we'll go to camaro but even then if it's  
<a onclick="modifyYTiframeseektime('3926')">1:05:26</a> the thing is if kobe wins would they do  
<a onclick="modifyYTiframeseektime('3927')">1:05:27</a> a third time  
<a onclick="modifyYTiframeseektime('3929')">1:05:29</a> it's boring isn't it it's it's  
<a onclick="modifyYTiframeseektime('3931')">1:05:31</a> i think it wouldn't sell yeah i mean  
<a onclick="modifyYTiframeseektime('3933')">1:05:33</a> yeah i mean i would watch it but i don't  
<a onclick="modifyYTiframeseektime('3934')">1:05:34</a> know if it's cell because he lost twice  
<a onclick="modifyYTiframeseektime('3936')">1:05:36</a> convincingly yeah i think it would have  
<a onclick="modifyYTiframeseektime('3938')">1:05:38</a> to be a camzat beating a kobe and now we  
<a onclick="modifyYTiframeseektime('3940')">1:05:40</a> have a new contender they're saying kobe  
<a onclick="modifyYTiframeseektime('3941')">1:05:41</a> is going to go up to middleweight now i  
<a onclick="modifyYTiframeseektime('3942')">1:05:42</a> think  
<a onclick="modifyYTiframeseektime('3943')">1:05:43</a> that's what no he said he's cooled up  
<a onclick="modifyYTiframeseektime('3946')">1:05:46</a> yeah  
<a onclick="modifyYTiframeseektime('3947')">1:05:47</a> oh uh  
<a onclick="modifyYTiframeseektime('3949')">1:05:49</a> maybe he's called him up  
<a onclick="modifyYTiframeseektime('3951')">1:05:51</a> you don't think he's because he's got a  
<a onclick="modifyYTiframeseektime('3952')">1:05:52</a> grappling pedigree right or do you i  
<a onclick="modifyYTiframeseektime('3954')">1:05:54</a> know he's very good look kobe is a real  
<a onclick="modifyYTiframeseektime('3955')">1:05:55</a> he's a legit fighter yeah i don't know  
<a onclick="modifyYTiframeseektime('3957')">1:05:57</a> if he beats uh  
<a onclick="modifyYTiframeseektime('3958')">1:05:58</a> uh  
<a onclick="modifyYTiframeseektime('3959')">1:05:59</a> i don't think so because

<a onclick="modifyYTiframeseektime('3963')">1:06:03</a> yeah sure sure but he's much bigger  
<a onclick="modifyYTiframeseektime('3965')">1:06:05</a> longer stronger dangerous at the same  
<a onclick="modifyYTiframeseektime('3967')">1:06:07</a> thing  
<a onclick="modifyYTiframeseektime('3969')">1:06:09</a> was bigger and stronger that's the  
<a onclick="modifyYTiframeseektime('3971')">1:06:11</a> difference yeah blood blochovic was 205  
<a onclick="modifyYTiframeseektime('3974')">1:06:14</a> yeah  
<a onclick="modifyYTiframeseektime('3975')">1:06:15</a> i think pound for pound at the seniors  
<a onclick="modifyYTiframeseektime('3976')">1:06:16</a> better than blojovic yeah but there's a  
<a onclick="modifyYTiframeseektime('3979')">1:06:19</a> massive there's a 20 pound weight  
<a onclick="modifyYTiframeseektime('3980')">1:06:20</a> difference wait a way in difference not  
<a onclick="modifyYTiframeseektime('3982')">1:06:22</a> even a weight difference  
<a onclick="modifyYTiframeseektime('3983')">1:06:23</a> blhovich was even bigger than that  
<a onclick="modifyYTiframeseektime('3985')">1:06:25</a> that's a massive order so adesanio beats  
<a onclick="modifyYTiframeseektime('3987')">1:06:27</a> kovy covington you see bobby covington  
<a onclick="modifyYTiframeseektime('3991')">1:06:31</a> what do you think is going to happen  
<a onclick="modifyYTiframeseektime('3992')">1:06:32</a> between him and uh hamzat if they go i  
<a onclick="modifyYTiframeseektime('3994')">1:06:34</a> think hamzad has his number really yeah  
<a onclick="modifyYTiframeseektime('3996')">1:06:36</a> with the grappling and stuff striking  
<a onclick="modifyYTiframeseektime('3998')">1:06:38</a> cannot strike him really  
<a onclick="modifyYTiframeseektime('4000')">1:06:40</a> i think so possible here's the thing  
<a onclick="modifyYTiframeseektime('4002')">1:06:42</a> here here's my i want to say one thing  
<a onclick="modifyYTiframeseektime('4004')">1:06:44</a> we haven't seen hamzat in later rounds  
<a onclick="modifyYTiframeseektime('4006')">1:06:46</a> sometimes the guy looks so good in round  
<a onclick="modifyYTiframeseektime('4008')">1:06:48</a> one and round two he falls apart round  
<a onclick="modifyYTiframeseektime('4009')">1:06:49</a> three he falls apart so i don't know  
<a onclick="modifyYTiframeseektime('4011')">1:06:51</a> that about him yet i don't know if he  
<a onclick="modifyYTiframeseektime('4012')">1:06:52</a> fights hard all the way to the third but  
<a onclick="modifyYTiframeseektime('4013')">1:06:53</a> if he can maintain what he does in  
<a onclick="modifyYTiframeseektime('4015')">1:06:55</a> rounds one  
<a onclick="modifyYTiframeseektime('4016')">1:06:56</a> because all i've seen is round one from  
<a onclick="modifyYTiframeseektime('4018')">1:06:58</a> we'll beat everybody him  
<a onclick="modifyYTiframeseektime('4019')">1:06:59</a> seen a lot from madison i mean he's good  
<a onclick="modifyYTiframeseektime('4021')">1:07:01</a> we know we know what he looks like  
<a onclick="modifyYTiframeseektime('4022')">1:07:02</a> around five and he's very durable yeah  
<a onclick="modifyYTiframeseektime('4024')">1:07:04</a> he's very durable yeah and uh  
<a onclick="modifyYTiframeseektime('4027')">1:07:07</a> mike there's a question mark and comes  
<a onclick="modifyYTiframeseektime('4029')">1:07:09</a> that does he have that durability i  
<a onclick="modifyYTiframeseektime('4030')">1:07:10</a> think so but we haven't seen it yet  
<a onclick="modifyYTiframeseektime('4032')">1:07:12</a> that's why i don't want to jump the gun  
<a onclick="modifyYTiframeseektime('4033')">1:07:13</a> and say yes he has it i don't know i  
<a onclick="modifyYTiframeseektime('4034')">1:07:14</a> haven't seen that yet but  
<a onclick="modifyYTiframeseektime('4036')">1:07:16</a> uh i i really like him against kobe so  
<a onclick="modifyYTiframeseektime('4038')">1:07:18</a> do you think he's that he he faces  
<a onclick="modifyYTiframeseektime('4039')">1:07:19</a> better chances against um  
<a onclick="modifyYTiframeseektime('4043')">1:07:23</a> sanya than he does against  
<a onclick="modifyYTiframeseektime('4045')">1:07:25</a> than he does against um  
<a onclick="modifyYTiframeseektime('4052')">1:07:32</a> that's tough to call i think uzman's  
<a onclick="modifyYTiframeseektime('4053')">1:07:33</a> ultimate challenge for hamzad right yeah  
<a onclick="modifyYTiframeseektime('4056')">1:07:36</a> because usman is very mentally tough  
<a onclick="modifyYTiframeseektime('4057')">1:07:37</a> also not that arasanya isn't but  
<a onclick="modifyYTiframeseektime('4059')">1:07:39</a> it's going to be easier to take down i  
<a onclick="modifyYTiframeseektime('4060')">1:07:40</a> think than uh kumaro  
<a onclick="modifyYTiframeseektime('4063')">1:07:43</a> that's that's the problem isn't that  
<a onclick="modifyYTiframeseektime('4064')">1:07:44</a> because kumar was he's only ever been  
<a onclick="modifyYTiframeseektime('4065')">1:07:45</a> taken down once in his career not that  
<a onclick="modifyYTiframeseektime('4067')">1:07:47</a> they counted it when kobe took him down  
<a onclick="modifyYTiframeseektime('4068')">1:07:48</a> the last fight they didn't statistically  
<a onclick="modifyYTiframeseektime('4070')">1:07:50</a> count it but in my opinion it was it was  
<a onclick="modifyYTiframeseektime('4072')">1:07:52</a> a takedown who would you have between  
<a onclick="modifyYTiframeseektime('4074')">1:07:54</a> usman and george simpion  
<a onclick="modifyYTiframeseektime('4078')">1:07:58</a> am i getting in trouble now  
<a onclick="modifyYTiframeseektime('4080')">1:08:00</a> listen i love both those guys yeah but  
<a onclick="modifyYTiframeseektime('4082')">1:08:02</a> if i have to be totally candid i think  
<a onclick="modifyYTiframeseektime('4084')">1:08:04</a> george just has more skills  
<a onclick="modifyYTiframeseektime('4085')">1:08:05</a> yeah george has more skills even now  
<a onclick="modifyYTiframeseektime('4087')">1:08:07</a> he's more developed yeah even though  
<a onclick="modifyYTiframeseektime('4088')">1:08:08</a> like his game goes deeper he has more  
<a onclick="modifyYTiframeseektime('4090')">1:08:10</a> layers  
<a onclick="modifyYTiframeseektime('4092')">1:08:12</a> and i love usman i really love us man i  
<a onclick="modifyYTiframeseektime('4093')">1:08:13</a> i love the guy he's  
<a onclick="modifyYTiframeseektime('4095')">1:08:15</a> if you met i don't know if you met him  
<a onclick="modifyYTiframeseektime('4098')">1:08:18</a> he's a very sweet humble person kind  
<a onclick="modifyYTiframeseektime('4100')">1:08:20</a> salted the earth guy um  
<a onclick="modifyYTiframeseektime('4104')">1:08:24</a> this goes beyond you know but i guess  
<a onclick="modifyYTiframeseektime('4106')">1:08:26</a> so so yeah but exactly so sure i i hate  
<a onclick="modifyYTiframeseektime('4108')">1:08:28</a> to pick one over the other because i  
<a onclick="modifyYTiframeseektime('4109')">1:08:29</a> like them both so much but george's game  
<a onclick="modifyYTiframeseektime('4111')">1:08:31</a> just goes deeper  
<a onclick="modifyYTiframeseektime('4112')">1:08:32</a> yeah he's just he has a greater  
<a onclick="modifyYTiframeseektime('4114')">1:08:34</a> understanding of  
<a onclick="modifyYTiframeseektime('4115')">1:08:35</a> what about khabib versus uh  
<a onclick="modifyYTiframeseektime('4118')">1:08:38</a> pound for a pound  
<a onclick="modifyYTiframeseektime('4119')">1:08:39</a> well if they had to catch weight let's  
<a onclick="modifyYTiframeseektime('4120')">1:08:40</a> see  
<a onclick="modifyYTiframeseektime('4123')">1:08:43</a> people are gonna people are gonna grill  
<a onclick="modifyYTiframeseektime('4124')">1:08:44</a> me for this but i'll pick khabib i think  
<a onclick="modifyYTiframeseektime('4126')">1:08:46</a> i think that highly of khabib i think  
<a onclick="modifyYTiframeseektime('4127')">1:08:47</a> khabib is the ultimate killing machine  
<a onclick="modifyYTiframeseektime('4129')">1:08:49</a> he's incredible  
<a onclick="modifyYTiframeseektime('4131')">1:08:51</a> so i just feel that khabib has a few  
<a onclick="modifyYTiframeseektime('4133')">1:08:53</a> more layers and he's he's just  
<a onclick="modifyYTiframeseektime('4135')">1:08:55</a> he's as tough mentally as as usman  
<a onclick="modifyYTiframeseektime('4138')">1:08:58</a> and not that i ever want to see them  
<a onclick="modifyYTiframeseektime('4139')">1:08:59</a> fight they're close you know they would  
<a onclick="modifyYTiframeseektime('4141')">1:09:01</a> never fight each other but i think i  
<a onclick="modifyYTiframeseektime('4142')">1:09:02</a> think khabib is like he's a special cut  
<a onclick="modifyYTiframeseektime('4145')">1:09:05</a> above  
<a onclick="modifyYTiframeseektime('4146')">1:09:06</a> he's very special khabib  
<a onclick="modifyYTiframeseektime('4149')">1:09:09</a> i wanted to speak to you more about your  
<a onclick="modifyYTiframeseektime('4150')">1:09:10</a> philosophies  
<a onclick="modifyYTiframeseektime('4153')">1:09:13</a> but i think what we'll do is we'll do um  
<a onclick="modifyYTiframeseektime('4156')">1:09:16</a> when you're when you're back in canada  
<a onclick="modifyYTiframeseektime('4157')">1:09:17</a> we'll do an episode just for them  
<a onclick="modifyYTiframeseektime('4160')">1:09:20</a> uh because  
<a onclick="modifyYTiframeseektime('4161')">1:09:21</a> last time when when i did this  
<a onclick="modifyYTiframeseektime('4163')">1:09:23</a> and we said oh we got for us we we made  
<a onclick="modifyYTiframeseektime('4165')">1:09:25</a> it the opposite way we kind of spoke  
<a onclick="modifyYTiframeseektime('4167')">1:09:27</a> more about the feel philosophical issues  
<a onclick="modifyYTiframeseektime('4168')">1:09:28</a> more  
<a onclick="modifyYTiframeseektime('4169')">1:09:29</a> and the um  
<a onclick="modifyYTiframeseektime('4171')">1:09:31</a> and the the the sports stuff less but  
<a onclick="modifyYTiframeseektime('4174')">1:09:34</a> this i think  
<a onclick="modifyYTiframeseektime('4175')">1:09:35</a> you know the first time we had a fleshed  
<a onclick="modifyYTiframeseektime('4177')">1:09:37</a> out conversation about these things i  
<a onclick="modifyYTiframeseektime('4179')">1:09:39</a> think this is very important for the  
<a onclick="modifyYTiframeseektime('4180')">1:09:40</a> muslim community but obviously people  
<a onclick="modifyYTiframeseektime('4182')">1:09:42</a> don't realize that you have been  
<a onclick="modifyYTiframeseektime('4184')">1:09:44</a> really deeply involved i mean one time  
<a onclick="modifyYTiframeseektime('4187')">1:09:47</a> maybe you wouldn't mind me saying this  
<a onclick="modifyYTiframeseektime('4188')">1:09:48</a> but  
<a onclick="modifyYTiframeseektime('4189')">1:09:49</a> in addition to your training you do  
<a onclick="modifyYTiframeseektime('4191')">1:09:51</a> hours and hours of studying don't you  
<a onclick="modifyYTiframeseektime('4193')">1:09:53</a> like  
<a onclick="modifyYTiframeseektime('4194')">1:09:54</a> maybe three four five hours a day or  
<a onclick="modifyYTiframeseektime('4196')">1:09:56</a> some how many hours yeah i would say two  
<a onclick="modifyYTiframeseektime('4198')">1:09:58</a> to five sometimes wow wow when i travel  
<a onclick="modifyYTiframeseektime('4201')">1:10:01</a> you read that much yeah i do what do you  
<a onclick="modifyYTiframeseektime('4204')">1:10:04</a> read what do you do  
<a onclick="modifyYTiframeseektime('4206')">1:10:06</a> i do a lot of you know what i really  
<a onclick="modifyYTiframeseektime('4207')">1:10:07</a> like uh is audible audible.com i use a  
<a onclick="modifyYTiframeseektime('4210')">1:10:10</a> lot of their  
<a onclick="modifyYTiframeseektime('4211')">1:10:11</a> audiobooks i do a lot of lectures i find  
<a onclick="modifyYTiframeseektime('4213')">1:10:13</a> lectures online science history  
<a onclick="modifyYTiframeseektime('4214')">1:10:14</a> philosophy  
<a onclick="modifyYTiframeseektime('4216')">1:10:16</a> religion i like to listen to debates  
<a onclick="modifyYTiframeseektime('4218')">1:10:18</a> lectures i mean absolutely everything on  
<a onclick="modifyYTiframeseektime('4220')">1:10:20</a> science history philosophy religion i  
<a onclick="modifyYTiframeseektime('4222')">1:10:22</a> listen to all of it i buy all the books  
<a onclick="modifyYTiframeseektime('4224')">1:10:24</a> i buy hundreds of books  
<a onclick="modifyYTiframeseektime('4225')">1:10:25</a> and for me it's a pleasure just  
<a onclick="modifyYTiframeseektime('4227')">1:10:27</a> listening to it as a pleasure like  
<a onclick="modifyYTiframeseektime('4228')">1:10:28</a> people listen to music i listen to  
<a onclick="modifyYTiframeseektime('4229')">1:10:29</a> audiobooks wow yeah and and as it helped  
<a onclick="modifyYTiframeseektime('4233')">1:10:33</a> you gain a sense of spirituality now  
<a onclick="modifyYTiframeseektime('4234')">1:10:34</a> we're two weeks away from ramadan  
<a onclick="modifyYTiframeseektime('4237')">1:10:37</a> like the the spiritual aspects of islam  
<a onclick="modifyYTiframeseektime('4240')">1:10:40</a> you've been reading a lot of ghazali  
<a onclick="modifyYTiframeseektime('4241')">1:10:41</a> recently as well haven't you and  
<a onclick="modifyYTiframeseektime('4244')">1:10:44</a> what have you what have you kind of  
<a onclick="modifyYTiframeseektime('4245')">1:10:45</a> taken from that and  
<a onclick="modifyYTiframeseektime('4247')">1:10:47</a> for people that might be listening to  
<a onclick="modifyYTiframeseektime('4248')">1:10:48</a> this who might not be aware of the  
<a onclick="modifyYTiframeseektime('4250')">1:10:50</a> islamic tradition in particular  
<a onclick="modifyYTiframeseektime('4251')">1:10:51</a> what would you guide them to in terms of  
<a onclick="modifyYTiframeseektime('4254')">1:10:54</a> reading material  
<a onclick="modifyYTiframeseektime('4256')">1:10:56</a> i think gazelle is hard to read honestly  
<a onclick="modifyYTiframeseektime('4258')">1:10:58</a> okay i think i think i would if i didn't  
<a onclick="modifyYTiframeseektime('4261')">1:11:01</a> study philosophy for so many years  
<a onclick="modifyYTiframeseektime('4262')">1:11:02</a> before gazali i wouldn't have understood  
<a onclick="modifyYTiframeseektime('4264')">1:11:04</a> anything he meant so i think hazel is  
<a onclick="modifyYTiframeseektime('4266')">1:11:06</a> actually quite a difficult read  
<a onclick="modifyYTiframeseektime('4269')">1:11:09</a> it's not a good place to start per se if  
<a onclick="modifyYTiframeseektime('4271')">1:11:11</a> you don't have a background yeah if you  
<a onclick="modifyYTiframeseektime('4272')">1:11:12</a> if you don't have a background then you  
<a onclick="modifyYTiframeseektime('4273')">1:11:13</a> start with the quran you know exactly  
<a onclick="modifyYTiframeseektime('4275')">1:11:15</a> with the profit  
<a onclick="modifyYTiframeseektime('4277')">1:11:17</a> it's a long ways away  
<a onclick="modifyYTiframeseektime('4279')">1:11:19</a> um  
<a onclick="modifyYTiframeseektime('4280')">1:11:20</a> i don't think i don't think philosophy  
<a onclick="modifyYTiframeseektime('4282')">1:11:22</a> is a place where you start yeah i  
<a onclick="modifyYTiframeseektime('4284')">1:11:24</a> definitely don't think you start there  
<a onclick="modifyYTiframeseektime('4285')">1:11:25</a> uh but you can you can build to that and  
<a onclick="modifyYTiframeseektime('4288')">1:11:28</a> um  
<a onclick="modifyYTiframeseektime('4289')">1:11:29</a> you know it's it's it's  
<a onclick="modifyYTiframeseektime('4291')">1:11:31</a> again you know you start with the quran  
<a onclick="modifyYTiframeseektime('4292')">1:11:32</a> the sunnah and then  
<a onclick="modifyYTiframeseektime('4295')">1:11:35</a> i'll listen i studied the greeks i  
<a onclick="modifyYTiframeseektime('4297')">1:11:37</a> studied muslim philosophers and the  
<a onclick="modifyYTiframeseektime('4299')">1:11:39</a> british empiricism and enlightenment  
<a onclick="modifyYTiframeseektime('4301')">1:11:41</a> period i think the three together  
<a onclick="modifyYTiframeseektime('4304')">1:11:44</a> because i think a lot of them each one  
<a onclick="modifyYTiframeseektime('4305')">1:11:45</a> of them was commentary of the on the  
<a onclick="modifyYTiframeseektime('4307')">1:11:47</a> past they were influenced by the past  
<a onclick="modifyYTiframeseektime('4309')">1:11:49</a> and  
<a onclick="modifyYTiframeseektime('4310')">1:11:50</a> logic is an innate thing  
<a onclick="modifyYTiframeseektime('4313')">1:11:53</a> so hazel said it beautifully said it  
<a onclick="modifyYTiframeseektime('4315')">1:11:55</a> doesn't matter who said it we have to  
<a onclick="modifyYTiframeseektime('4316')">1:11:56</a> study each  
<a onclick="modifyYTiframeseektime('4317')">1:11:57</a> each claim by itself standing alone and  
<a onclick="modifyYTiframeseektime('4320')">1:12:00</a> see whether it's true or not doesn't  
<a onclick="modifyYTiframeseektime('4321')">1:12:01</a> matter if aristotle said something or  
<a onclick="modifyYTiframeseektime('4323')">1:12:03</a> this guy said something it doesn't  
<a onclick="modifyYTiframeseektime('4324')">1:12:04</a> matter we have to verify it for  
<a onclick="modifyYTiframeseektime('4325')">1:12:05</a> ourselves we have to have demonstration  
<a onclick="modifyYTiframeseektime('4328')">1:12:08</a> and this is this is i think very  
<a onclick="modifyYTiframeseektime('4329')">1:12:09</a> important but ultimately speaking  
<a onclick="modifyYTiframeseektime('4331')">1:12:11</a> everything boils back down to the fitrah  
<a onclick="modifyYTiframeseektime('4334')">1:12:14</a> like you can't go further than that once  
<a onclick="modifyYTiframeseektime('4335')">1:12:15</a> you try to go further than that this is  
<a onclick="modifyYTiframeseektime('4336')">1:12:16</a> the limit  
<a onclick="modifyYTiframeseektime('4338')">1:12:18</a> and  
<a onclick="modifyYTiframeseektime('4339')">1:12:19</a> this is what gives certainty hazali's  
<a onclick="modifyYTiframeseektime('4341')">1:12:21</a> work is all about getting to certainty  
<a onclick="modifyYTiframeseektime('4344')">1:12:24</a> and certainty is a very special thing we  
<a onclick="modifyYTiframeseektime('4345')">1:12:25</a> have to differentiate between knowledge

<a onclick="modifyYTiframeseektime('4507')">1:15:07</a> give for  
<a onclick="modifyYTiframeseektime('4508')">1:15:08</a> instance nature nature is the most  
<a onclick="modifyYTiframeseektime('4510')">1:15:10</a> famous deity in today's age nature what  
<a onclick="modifyYTiframeseektime('4513')">1:15:13</a> brought us about nature  
<a onclick="modifyYTiframeseektime('4514')">1:15:14</a> nature is just that a word is just sound  
<a onclick="modifyYTiframeseektime('4516')">1:15:16</a> you made with your mouth what does it  
<a onclick="modifyYTiframeseektime('4518')">1:15:18</a> mean nature  
<a onclick="modifyYTiframeseektime('4519')">1:15:19</a> see  
<a onclick="modifyYTiframeseektime('4520')">1:15:20</a> nature comes from your observation of  
<a onclick="modifyYTiframeseektime('4522')">1:15:22</a> particulars if i asked you what is  
<a onclick="modifyYTiframeseektime('4524')">1:15:24</a> nature you would say  
<a onclick="modifyYTiframeseektime('4525')">1:15:25</a> well you would have to point to examples  
<a onclick="modifyYTiframeseektime('4527')">1:15:27</a> you would say look at that flower  
<a onclick="modifyYTiframeseektime('4530')">1:15:30</a> that's nature okay if i destroy all the  
<a onclick="modifyYTiframeseektime('4532')">1:15:32</a> flowers nature's gone no no no there's  
<a onclick="modifyYTiframeseektime('4533')">1:15:33</a> also  
<a onclick="modifyYTiframeseektime('4534')">1:15:34</a> the river  
<a onclick="modifyYTiframeseektime('4536')">1:15:36</a> the water cycle the trees

<a onclick="modifyYTiframeseektime('4545')">1:15:45</a> there's still more what if i destroy  
<a onclick="modifyYTiframeseektime('4547')">1:15:47</a> every particular thing  
<a onclick="modifyYTiframeseektime('4549')">1:15:49</a> what if we had a universe an empty  
<a onclick="modifyYTiframeseektime('4550')">1:15:50</a> universe would you know nature now you  
<a onclick="modifyYTiframeseektime('4553')">1:15:53</a> wouldn't know nature now there's nothing  
<a onclick="modifyYTiframeseektime('4554')">1:15:54</a> there's no collective  
<a onclick="modifyYTiframeseektime('4556')">1:15:56</a> so  
<a onclick="modifyYTiframeseektime('4557')">1:15:57</a> how do you know nature well you saw  
<a onclick="modifyYTiframeseektime('4558')">1:15:58</a> blades of grass  
<a onclick="modifyYTiframeseektime('4561')">1:16:01</a> you felt the wind  
<a onclick="modifyYTiframeseektime('4562')">1:16:02</a> and the word nature is just a collective  
<a onclick="modifyYTiframeseektime('4564')">1:16:04</a> to name all those particulars you  
<a onclick="modifyYTiframeseektime('4565')">1:16:05</a> experienced  
<a onclick="modifyYTiframeseektime('4566')">1:16:06</a> i mean this is exactly what um i think  
<a onclick="modifyYTiframeseektime('4569')">1:16:09</a> he believed in that and certainly  
<a onclick="modifyYTiframeseektime('4570')">1:16:10</a> nominalism yeah nominalism and and um  
<a onclick="modifyYTiframeseektime('4575')">1:16:15</a> was you could say conceptualist as well  
<a onclick="modifyYTiframeseektime('4576')">1:16:16</a> like in the sense that he didn't believe  
<a onclick="modifyYTiframeseektime('4578')">1:16:18</a> in el culiereto like the gene genuses or  
<a onclick="modifyYTiframeseektime('4581')">1:16:21</a> the universals existed  
<a onclick="modifyYTiframeseektime('4583')">1:16:23</a> in reality and said you only know them  
<a onclick="modifyYTiframeseektime('4585')">1:16:25</a> through the particulars we're projecting  
<a onclick="modifyYTiframeseektime('4586')">1:16:26</a> them from our minds this is a name i  
<a onclick="modifyYTiframeseektime('4588')">1:16:28</a> give like for instance how many trees  
<a onclick="modifyYTiframeseektime('4590')">1:16:30</a> does it take to make a forest well  
<a onclick="modifyYTiframeseektime('4591')">1:16:31</a> that's subjective you might have a  
<a onclick="modifyYTiframeseektime('4592')">1:16:32</a> different number than me it's a  
<a onclick="modifyYTiframeseektime('4594')">1:16:34</a> projection of our mind what do you think  
<a onclick="modifyYTiframeseektime('4596')">1:16:36</a> it is it's there's there's subjectivity  
<a onclick="modifyYTiframeseektime('4597')">1:16:37</a> is always mingled in what you what you  
<a onclick="modifyYTiframeseektime('4599')">1:16:39</a> call truth  
<a onclick="modifyYTiframeseektime('4601')">1:16:41</a> except in one instance  
<a onclick="modifyYTiframeseektime('4602')">1:16:42</a> so there's part concept part observation  
<a onclick="modifyYTiframeseektime('4606')">1:16:46</a> in a quran it says do they not  
<a onclick="modifyYTiframeseektime('4608')">1:16:48</a> consider the seed that they sow like  
<a onclick="modifyYTiframeseektime('4611')">1:16:51</a> your  
<a onclick="modifyYTiframeseektime('4612')">1:16:52</a> nature is coming after your observation  
<a onclick="modifyYTiframeseektime('4614')">1:16:54</a> so i observed  
<a onclick="modifyYTiframeseektime('4616')">1:16:56</a> particulars  
<a onclick="modifyYTiframeseektime('4617')">1:16:57</a> then i came up with the idea of nature  
<a onclick="modifyYTiframeseektime('4619')">1:16:59</a> without the particulars that universal  
<a onclick="modifyYTiframeseektime('4621')">1:17:01</a> doesn't exist  
<a onclick="modifyYTiframeseektime('4623')">1:17:03</a> the universal is dependent on  
<a onclick="modifyYTiframeseektime('4625')">1:17:05</a> particulars  
<a onclick="modifyYTiframeseektime('4626')">1:17:06</a> allah is telling you look i don't depend  
<a onclick="modifyYTiframeseektime('4628')">1:17:08</a> on particulars  
<a onclick="modifyYTiframeseektime('4629')">1:17:09</a> i am the particular this is the quranic  
<a onclick="modifyYTiframeseektime('4631')">1:17:11</a> point of view  
<a onclick="modifyYTiframeseektime('4632')">1:17:12</a> so one example i've  
<a onclick="modifyYTiframeseektime('4634')">1:17:14</a> come up with recently is to help make  
<a onclick="modifyYTiframeseektime('4636')">1:17:16</a> this even clearer is remember the ship  
<a onclick="modifyYTiframeseektime('4638')">1:17:18</a> of thesis yeah okay so let's think about  
<a onclick="modifyYTiframeseektime('4640')">1:17:20</a> the ship of thesis okay i'm gonna i'm  
<a onclick="modifyYTiframeseektime('4642')">1:17:22</a> gonna go through it again real quick  
<a onclick="modifyYTiframeseektime('4643')">1:17:23</a> because i know we've done it before yeah  
<a onclick="modifyYTiframeseektime('4644')">1:17:24</a> the ship of thesis is a ship of 99 parts  
<a onclick="modifyYTiframeseektime('4647')">1:17:27</a> it belongs to a man named thesis every  
<a onclick="modifyYTiframeseektime('4649')">1:17:29</a> day he changes changes apart  
<a onclick="modifyYTiframeseektime('4652')">1:17:32</a> after 99 days his ship has been  
<a onclick="modifyYTiframeseektime('4654')">1:17:34</a> completely re  
<a onclick="modifyYTiframeseektime('4655')">1:17:35</a> every pace has been changed 99 days 99  
<a onclick="modifyYTiframeseektime('4658')">1:17:38</a> parts  
<a onclick="modifyYTiframeseektime('4659')">1:17:39</a> those old parts we put them in a  
<a onclick="modifyYTiframeseektime('4660')">1:17:40</a> warehouse somewhere he's sailing that  
<a onclick="modifyYTiframeseektime('4662')">1:17:42</a> ship we all identified as the ship of  
<a onclick="modifyYTiframeseektime('4664')">1:17:44</a> thesis  
<a onclick="modifyYTiframeseektime('4666')">1:17:46</a> then one day i go in the warehouse i put  
<a onclick="modifyYTiframeseektime('4667')">1:17:47</a> this the old pieces back together now  
<a onclick="modifyYTiframeseektime('4669')">1:17:49</a> there are two ships on the ocean we both  
<a onclick="modifyYTiframeseektime('4671')">1:17:51</a> call them both the ship of theseus and  
<a onclick="modifyYTiframeseektime('4672')">1:17:52</a> if i ask you which one is the ship of  
<a onclick="modifyYTiframeseektime('4673')">1:17:53</a> pieces  
<a onclick="modifyYTiframeseektime('4674')">1:17:54</a> well now it has a lot to do with your  
<a onclick="modifyYTiframeseektime('4676')">1:17:56</a> subjective uh sense of what identity is  
<a onclick="modifyYTiframeseektime('4679')">1:17:59</a> there's no objective way to  
<a onclick="modifyYTiframeseektime('4680')">1:18:00</a> differentiate which one is the ship of  
<a onclick="modifyYTiframeseektime('4682')">1:18:02</a> thesis  
<a onclick="modifyYTiframeseektime('4683')">1:18:03</a> now imagine these two ships are i'm  
<a onclick="modifyYTiframeseektime('4685')">1:18:05</a> gonna make the problem even worse  
<a onclick="modifyYTiframeseektime('4686')">1:18:06</a> imagine these two ships are going around  
<a onclick="modifyYTiframeseektime('4688')">1:18:08</a> on the ocean  
<a onclick="modifyYTiframeseektime('4690')">1:18:10</a> and every day each ship is still  
<a onclick="modifyYTiframeseektime('4691')">1:18:11</a> changing a new piece  
<a onclick="modifyYTiframeseektime('4694')">1:18:14</a> and the old pieces i'm taking from both  
<a onclick="modifyYTiframeseektime('4695')">1:18:15</a> ships and i'm creating a third ship  
<a onclick="modifyYTiframeseektime('4699')">1:18:19</a> and the ships are changing piece every  
<a onclick="modifyYTiframeseektime('4700')">1:18:20</a> day and  
<a onclick="modifyYTiframeseektime('4701')">1:18:21</a> they're they're their particulars are  
<a onclick="modifyYTiframeseektime('4703')">1:18:23</a> being mingled shuffled like a card of  
<a onclick="modifyYTiframeseektime('4705')">1:18:25</a> deck of cards and i'm making thousands  
<a onclick="modifyYTiframeseektime('4706')">1:18:26</a> and thousands of ships now ask you which  
<a onclick="modifyYTiframeseektime('4708')">1:18:28</a> one is the ship of thesis you're like  
<a onclick="modifyYTiframeseektime('4709')">1:18:29</a> hey well you know it all depends on how  
<a onclick="modifyYTiframeseektime('4710')">1:18:30</a> you see it  
<a onclick="modifyYTiframeseektime('4713')">1:18:33</a> the ship of thesis is an archetype  
<a onclick="modifyYTiframeseektime('4716')">1:18:36</a> there's an archetype in your mind and  
<a onclick="modifyYTiframeseektime('4717')">1:18:37</a> you use that archetype this is what  
<a onclick="modifyYTiframeseektime('4719')">1:18:39</a> plato called the forms to identify  
<a onclick="modifyYTiframeseektime('4720')">1:18:40</a> what's out there  
<a onclick="modifyYTiframeseektime('4723')">1:18:43</a> but now i want you to  
<a onclick="modifyYTiframeseektime('4725')">1:18:45</a> put this example to the side think about

<a onclick="modifyYTiframeseektime('4857')">1:20:57</a> is a table  
<a onclick="modifyYTiframeseektime('4859')">1:20:59</a> now you have direct experience with the

<a onclick="modifyYTiframeseektime('4872')">1:21:12</a> this is very important because when i  
<a onclick="modifyYTiframeseektime('4873')">1:21:13</a> tell you about allah you don't tell me  
<a onclick="modifyYTiframeseektime('4874')">1:21:14</a> what does that mean i never heard of

<a onclick="modifyYTiframeseektime('4878')">1:21:18</a> pointed i never pointed here this is

<a onclick="modifyYTiframeseektime('4882')">1:21:22</a> you know allah so i say there's no  
<a onclick="modifyYTiframeseektime('4883')">1:21:23</a> atheist  
<a onclick="modifyYTiframeseektime('4884')">1:21:24</a> because i've never spoke to a person who

<a onclick="modifyYTiframeseektime('4887')">1:21:27</a> you're talking about  
<a onclick="modifyYTiframeseektime('4889')">1:21:29</a> because if i'm  
<a onclick="modifyYTiframeseektime('4890')">1:21:30</a> you cannot truly make up something all  
<a onclick="modifyYTiframeseektime('4892')">1:21:32</a> you could do is take things that exist  
<a onclick="modifyYTiframeseektime('4894')">1:21:34</a> and make a collage  
<a onclick="modifyYTiframeseektime('4897')">1:21:37</a> so if people tell me look i believe in  
<a onclick="modifyYTiframeseektime('4898')">1:21:38</a> the god of war i might say no you took  
<a onclick="modifyYTiframeseektime('4900')">1:21:40</a> god and you took war and you mingled  
<a onclick="modifyYTiframeseektime('4902')">1:21:42</a> them together  
<a onclick="modifyYTiframeseektime('4904')">1:21:44</a> but  
<a onclick="modifyYTiframeseektime('4905')">1:21:45</a> like a blind man can never know the

<a onclick="modifyYTiframeseektime('4914')">1:21:54</a> wow  
<a onclick="modifyYTiframeseektime('4916')">1:21:56</a> so i i came up with another thought

<a onclick="modifyYTiframeseektime('5042')">1:24:02</a> polytheism  
<a onclick="modifyYTiframeseektime('5045')">1:24:05</a> so that's where where polytheism comes  
<a onclick="modifyYTiframeseektime('5047')">1:24:07</a> from yeah i always tell people you learn  
<a onclick="modifyYTiframeseektime('5049')">1:24:09</a> the number one first

<a onclick="modifyYTiframeseektime('5070')">1:24:30</a> rely on experience experiences  
<a onclick="modifyYTiframeseektime('5073')">1:24:33</a> when we say the word god it also relies
