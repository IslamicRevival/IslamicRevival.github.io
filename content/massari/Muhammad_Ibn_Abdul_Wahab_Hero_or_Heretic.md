 discusses arguments for and against Muhammad ibn Abdul Wahab, with the main argument being that he was either a hero or a heretic.  argues that there is no clear definition for who is a "sahabi," and that this ambiguity has led to various disputes and disagreements among Muslims. It also discusses the idea that different companions had different levels of understanding of the Quran, and that this difference in understanding makes the companions' understanding of the Quran the "best of understanding."

**<a onclick="modifyYTiframeseektime('0')">00:00:00</a>* Discusses various arguments surrounding Muhammad Ibn Abdul Wahab, with the Saudi government scholar being the most prominent. The main themes of the Saudi camp are that he was a pure kidde of the Salaf, that there is a consensus on what constitutes Salif, and that ruling and accountability must come from those who follow Salif. The rebuttals provided by various Islamic YouTubers and personalities do not adequately address these points, and instead present a narrative which the Saudi government does not agree with. Sheikh Muhammad al-Masri, a professor of physics, has produced strong evidence which challenges the Saudi government's scholarship. He is a prominent activist in the UK, and his books on fundamental issues have made him well-known in the Islamic world.
* **<a onclick="modifyYTiframeseektime('300')">00:05:00</a>* Discusses the different types of salafis or "followers of the rightly-guided caliphs" and their differences. One of the main points made is that there is no clear definition of a salafi, and even the early salafis did not have a clear definition of what constituted a salafi. Professor Muhammad explains that a salafi is someone who is rooted in the early, authentic salafiyya tradition and has a deep understanding of Islamic theology.
* **<a onclick="modifyYTiframeseektime('600')">00:10:00</a>** of the video argues that there is no clear definition for who is a "sahabi," and that this ambiguity has led to various disputes and disagreements among Muslims.  also argues that Muhammad ibn Abdul Wahab was not a true sahabi because he did not spend enough time in Medina.
* **<a onclick="modifyYTiframeseektime('900')">00:15:00</a>* Discusses the idea that different companions had different levels of understanding of the Quran. It argues that this difference in understanding makes the companions' understanding of the Quran the "best of understanding." However, the video argues that this understanding is not based on empirical evidence, and instead is based on the companions' innate qualities.  also argues that the companions were sincere and willing to sacrifice their lives for Islam.
* **<a onclick="modifyYTiframeseektime('1200')">00:20:00</a>* Discusses the differences between Muhammad ibn Abdul Wahab and other reformists in Islam, highlighting Ibn Abdul Wahab's more extreme views. Ibn Abdul Wahab is considered a hero by some Wahhabis, while others view him as a heretic.
* **<a onclick="modifyYTiframeseektime('1500')">00:25:00</a>**  Muhammad Ibn Abdul Wahab is compared to various sahaba in terms of their level of comprehension and understanding. He argues that there are many issues of understanding and comprehension that were already disagreed upon by the sahaba, and that there is no evidence that the prophets were angels or living in other worlds.
* **<a onclick="modifyYTiframeseektime('1800')">00:30:00</a>** Theta Vida argues that Muhammad ibn Abdul Wahab was either a hero or a heretic, depending on whether one believes in his fundamental beliefs. He claims that the majority of Muslims follow the same path, but that there are secondary issues that Muslims must know about, like the fact that Allah created the heavens in six days and after that he mounted the throne. He argues that this is not a matter of consensus, and that even if a scholar disagrees with the beliefs of Muhammad ibn Abdul Wahab, they are still obliged to know about them.
* **<a onclick="modifyYTiframeseektime('2100')">00:35:00</a>** discusses an Islamic belief that there are two types of worship: " Active" or "ritual" worship, and "worship of creation." contends that the definition of "worship" given in this belief is not consistent with the definition given in the Quran. argues that this belief is a "slap" to the Quran, and that it flies in the face of the Islamic belief that Allah is without sons.
* **<a onclick="modifyYTiframeseektime('2400')">00:40:00</a>* Discusses the various reasons why Muhammad ibn Abdul Wahab might be considered a hero or heretic. It argues that, if Allah is not capable of having a son, then this would mean that other deities exist which can take creation away from Allah. Furthermore, the video argues that Muhammad ibn Abdul Wahab was obsessed with this idea to the point where he was able to cooperate with a ruler to have power.
* **<a onclick="modifyYTiframeseektime('2700')">00:45:00</a>* Discusses how Muhammad Ibn Abdul Wahab, a hero or heretic, differed from other Islamic leaders in that he was focused on establishing power and convincing the population to obey instead of rebelling against religious authority.
* **<a onclick="modifyYTiframeseektime('3000')">00:50:00</a>** 
* **<a onclick="modifyYTiframeseektime('3300')">00:55:00</a>* Discusses secondary questions about the Quran, such as whether it was created or not. It goes on to say that these are all minor issues, and that the main issue is that Muhammad and his followers disagreed on certain theological matters.  argues that this is why the issue of the Quran's creation is not a major one, and that evidence is needed to support any claims.

 discusses the controversy around the late Islamic scholar Muhammad Ibn Abdul Wahab. Ibn Abdul Wahab believed that it was better to do less obligatory prayers in order to make it easier for people to follow the religion. He also disagreed with the practice of reciting the Quran in Arabic, considering it to be a form of idolatry. Despite these disagreements, many Muslims regard him as a hero for his efforts to spread Islam in the Arabian Peninsula.

* **<a onclick="modifyYTiframeseektime('3900')">01:05:00</a>** argues that Prophet Muhammad was a hero or heretic based on his statements about how small and small-sized stones are best suited for prayer. He also argues that excessive devotion to religious rituals (such as cutting one's hand off as a sign of devotion) can lead to destruction.
* **<a onclick="modifyYTiframeseektime('4200')">01:10:00</a>** discusses a Hadith in which a man is described as having a strike in his face indicative of the devil.  goes on to discuss how this man may be a model of piety, but is different from the majority of Muslims in that he is not focused purely on religious practices.
* **<a onclick="modifyYTiframeseektime('4500')">01:15:00</a>** discusses the controversial Islamic figure Muhammad ibn Abdul Wahab, who is either a hero or heretic. The narrator discusses how Muhammad ibn Abdul Wahab differed from the other Muslim leaders of his time, and how he hesitated before attempting to kill a man who was reportedly praying.  finishes with a discussion of why it is impossible for Muhammad ibn Abdul Wahab to have killed the man, as his history would have to take away from his claim to be a true Muslim.
* **<a onclick="modifyYTiframeseektime('4800')">01:20:00</a>** 
* **<a onclick="modifyYTiframeseektime('5100')">01:25:00</a>* Discusses the different rulings that Allah has established, including arbitration. It goes on to say that even when an arbitration is carried out, it is only for the benefit of Allah.
* **<a onclick="modifyYTiframeseektime('5400')">01:30:00</a>* Discusses how Muhammad ibn Abdul Wahab, a Muslim reformer, is either a hero or heretic, depending on how one interprets his teachings.

* **<a onclick="modifyYTiframeseektime('5700')">01:35:00</a>* Discusses the Islamic concept of obedience, and how it applies to both domestic and foreign rulers. It points out that if a ruler breaks his or her oaths, they can be fought.
* **<a onclick="modifyYTiframeseektime('6000')">01:40:00</a>** discusses the various reasons for fighting people, stating that if they break their covenants and establish justice, then they are worthy of being fought. He also points out that if an Imam after college has expired, then Allah will place the case of all people upon them.
* **<a onclick="modifyYTiframeseektime('6300')">01:45:00</a>** The narrator discusses a Hadith in which Muhammad orders Muslims not to obey non-Muslims in court or attach resources to them, emphasizing the importance of obedience to Allah. He points out that this Hadith does not support the Madras's narrative that non-Muslims are "evil" and "oppressor[s] of Muslims." The narrator explains that the reason the Hadith is ignored is because some Hadith scholars try to use it to support their argument that there is no government in Islam. He warns that this mindset will lead to Muslims losing their faith.
* **<a onclick="modifyYTiframeseektime('6600')">01:50:00</a>** Imam Ibn Abdul Wahab was a Mujaddid who argued that the consensus of scholars is not based on anything, and that Hadith should be studied for its virtues, not its faults. He also cautioned against blindly following any Imam, and advised learning the Quran and applying it to one's life.
* **<a onclick="modifyYTiframeseektime('6900')">01:55:00</a>** Muhammad Ibn Abdul Wahab discusses the importance of studying the Quran and applying it to one's life, contrasting this advice with that of people who focus on worldly matters such as fitness. He contends that the world will eventually come to an end, and that the best way to prepare for this is to learn the Quran and apply it to one's life. He warns that society is on the brink of disaster, and that the only way to save people is to have a leader who can provide peace and order.

**<a onclick="modifyYTiframeseektime('7200')">02:00:00</a>** Muhammad Ibn Abdul Wahab was either a hero or heretic, depending on one's perspective. Before his death, Ibn Abdul Wahab disclosed some of his thoughts on religion, mathematics, and other topics. He was not a scholar, but his writings were respected by some. After he died, his ideas were dismissed by scholars, who argued that he was not qualified to speak on such matters.
* **<a onclick="modifyYTiframeseektime('7500')">02:05:00</a>* Discusses how some Muslims believe that venerating graves is idolatry, and how this belief is used to avoid discussing controversial issues with them.

* **<a onclick="modifyYTiframeseektime('7800')">02:10:00</a>** discusses the idea that some scholars encourage people to take other people's works and burn them, arguing that this is a way of suppressing rational discourse.
* **<a onclick="modifyYTiframeseektime('8100')">02:15:00</a>** The narrator discusses how some of the scholars and imams of the modern era were extremely anti-change in Sharia, and that this attitude would make it difficult to enforce any violations of Sharia.

He points out that there is no such thing as a " secular celebrity" in Islam, because there is no such thing as a secular world. The kingdom of God, which Muslims believe will be established on earth, is an Otherworldly reality. Christianity, which he argues is a complete deviation from true Islam, is the only religion that has survived since the third century. He urges Muslims not to get involved in secular matters, as these are distractions from the goal of establishing Allah's justice on earth.

* **<a onclick="modifyYTiframeseektime('9900')">02:45:00</a>** The narrator discusses how some people think that Muhammad ibn Abdul Wahab, a revered Muslim scholar and founder of the Wahhabi movement, was either a hero or heretic.

* **<a onclick="modifyYTiframeseektime('10500')">02:55:00</a>**  David argues that, according to the Qur'an, worship is only due to Allah, and that there is no other deity beside Him. He also points out that, based on this principle, Muhammad ibn Abdul Wahab -- considered a hero by many Muslims -- was actually a heretic because he worshipped other beings besides Allah.

<a onclick="modifyYTiframeseektime('318')">0:05:18</a> um  
<a onclick="modifyYTiframeseektime('318')">0:05:18</a> what is it just to start things off what  
<a onclick="modifyYTiframeseektime('322')">0:05:22</a> is your understanding of what  
<a onclick="modifyYTiframeseektime('323')">0:05:23</a> constitutes a seller and this is  
<a onclick="modifyYTiframeseektime('325')">0:05:25</a> distance from Akida isn't that a good  
<a onclick="modifyYTiframeseektime('328')">0:05:28</a> thing is there a consensus on what

<a onclick="modifyYTiframeseektime('332')">0:05:32</a> that is something which we should aspire  
<a onclick="modifyYTiframeseektime('334')">0:05:34</a> to and this is uh what they what they  
<a onclick="modifyYTiframeseektime('337')">0:05:37</a> call salafand or the definition of self  
<a onclick="modifyYTiframeseektime('339')">0:05:39</a> is uh is relatively late uh it it was  
<a onclick="modifyYTiframeseektime('343')">0:05:43</a> used casually like for example we have  
<a onclick="modifyYTiframeseektime('346')">0:05:46</a> one one Hadith narrating scholar of high  
<a onclick="modifyYTiframeseektime('350')">0:05:50</a> level of authenticity and exactness and  
<a onclick="modifyYTiframeseektime('353')">0:05:53</a> matter of narratives and the other  
<a onclick="modifyYTiframeseektime('355')">0:05:55</a> personal piety he was doing doing rebat  
<a onclick="modifyYTiframeseektime('358')">0:05:58</a> doing guarding at the border of the  
<a onclick="modifyYTiframeseektime('360')">0:06:00</a> Romans and and so on but he was quite  
<a onclick="modifyYTiframeseektime('365')">0:06:05</a> negative to some Scholars because his  
<a onclick="modifyYTiframeseektime('366')">0:06:06</a> goofy is from otakafi origin he was  
<a onclick="modifyYTiframeseektime('369')">0:06:09</a> negative to other Scholars and did not  
<a onclick="modifyYTiframeseektime('371')">0:06:11</a> want to sit with them and so on because  
<a onclick="modifyYTiframeseektime('373')">0:06:13</a> he said they attacked the salaf actually  
<a onclick="modifyYTiframeseektime('374')">0:06:14</a> they were attacking that's what he means  
<a onclick="modifyYTiframeseektime('377')">0:06:17</a> her so the word like that is  
<a onclick="modifyYTiframeseektime('379')">0:06:19</a> the previous generation the past  
<a onclick="modifyYTiframeseektime('382')">0:06:22</a> the the similar in the in the in  
<a onclick="modifyYTiframeseektime('385')">0:06:25</a> Christianity we talk about the  
<a onclick="modifyYTiframeseektime('387')">0:06:27</a> disciplines of the Apostles that's  
<a onclick="modifyYTiframeseektime('388')">0:06:28</a> something something like that but it was  
<a onclick="modifyYTiframeseektime('390')">0:06:30</a> not made precise and nobody dedicated  
<a onclick="modifyYTiframeseektime('392')">0:06:32</a> himself  
<a onclick="modifyYTiframeseektime('394')">0:06:34</a> until we we uh we came almost to the  
<a onclick="modifyYTiframeseektime('398')">0:06:38</a> fourth century when the first one called  
<a onclick="modifyYTiframeseektime('399')">0:06:39</a> himself salafi is  
<a onclick="modifyYTiframeseektime('403')">0:06:43</a> so it became like a title  
<a onclick="modifyYTiframeseektime('406')">0:06:46</a> so it is  
<a onclick="modifyYTiframeseektime('407')">0:06:47</a> meaning what have been passed but it is  
<a onclick="modifyYTiframeseektime('411')">0:06:51</a> what's the definition  
<a onclick="modifyYTiframeseektime('413')">0:06:53</a> there's no nuclear definition if you ask  
<a onclick="modifyYTiframeseektime('416')">0:06:56</a> them to say the three good degenerations  
<a onclick="modifyYTiframeseektime('418')">0:06:58</a> according to a Hadith that the best of  
<a onclick="modifyYTiframeseektime('420')">0:07:00</a> the of the human species or another is  
<a onclick="modifyYTiframeseektime('423')">0:07:03</a> are the three my uh these my my  
<a onclick="modifyYTiframeseektime('427')">0:07:07</a> generation and then the one for the  
<a onclick="modifyYTiframeseektime('428')">0:07:08</a> followers and the fair to follow and  
<a onclick="modifyYTiframeseektime('431')">0:07:11</a> some Nations say he mentioned four  
<a onclick="modifyYTiframeseektime('432')">0:07:12</a> something just say three so we can agree  
<a onclick="modifyYTiframeseektime('434')">0:07:14</a> on three definitely  
<a onclick="modifyYTiframeseektime('436')">0:07:16</a> that's that's that's the that's the  
<a onclick="modifyYTiframeseektime('438')">0:07:18</a> first one then  
<a onclick="modifyYTiframeseektime('440')">0:07:20</a> when things are scrutinized a little bit  
<a onclick="modifyYTiframeseektime('442')">0:07:22</a> it turns out that the third generation  
<a onclick="modifyYTiframeseektime('444')">0:07:24</a> is having so much divergences and points  
<a onclick="modifyYTiframeseektime('447')">0:07:27</a> of view  
<a onclick="modifyYTiframeseektime('448')">0:07:28</a> even less than what we have now so they  
<a onclick="modifyYTiframeseektime('451')">0:07:31</a> escape to tavieri Second Generation  
<a onclick="modifyYTiframeseektime('453')">0:07:33</a> meaning generation meaning companions  
<a onclick="modifyYTiframeseektime('455')">0:07:35</a> that one moment also the profit Etc  
<a onclick="modifyYTiframeseektime('457')">0:07:37</a> would have an obscore of definition will  
<a onclick="modifyYTiframeseektime('459')">0:07:39</a> come to that and then the one who follow  
<a onclick="modifyYTiframeseektime('461')">0:07:41</a> them called tabulary which are  
<a onclick="modifyYTiframeseektime('463')">0:07:43</a> themselves  
<a onclick="modifyYTiframeseektime('468')">0:07:48</a> but the Mr Prophet did not meet him  
<a onclick="modifyYTiframeseektime('471')">0:07:51</a> because they blessed Islam later or they  
<a onclick="modifyYTiframeseektime('473')">0:07:53</a> were far away and this is the elder or a  
<a onclick="modifyYTiframeseektime('477')">0:07:57</a> senior tabian that's the one who are  
<a onclick="modifyYTiframeseektime('479')">0:07:59</a> born just maybe time Abu Bakr or the end  
<a onclick="modifyYTiframeseektime('482')">0:08:02</a> time of the Prophet so they cannot come  
<a onclick="modifyYTiframeseektime('484')">0:08:04</a> that's companion  
<a onclick="modifyYTiframeseektime('485')">0:08:05</a> and then we have the middle tab here in  
<a onclick="modifyYTiframeseektime('487')">0:08:07</a> the one boy it's actually born around  
<a onclick="modifyYTiframeseektime('490')">0:08:10</a> the time of the end time of Omar and  
<a onclick="modifyYTiframeseektime('492')">0:08:12</a> then the under middle  
<a onclick="modifyYTiframeseektime('494')">0:08:14</a> which are born about the time of the end  
<a onclick="modifyYTiframeseektime('496')">0:08:16</a> of Osman and then there's  
<a onclick="modifyYTiframeseektime('498')">0:08:18</a> in the 50s history and so on like like  
<a onclick="modifyYTiframeseektime('502')">0:08:22</a> uh the famous One is  
<a onclick="modifyYTiframeseektime('505')">0:08:25</a> because he met at least and he got from  
<a onclick="modifyYTiframeseektime('508')">0:08:28</a> anasematic so he's a table  
<a onclick="modifyYTiframeseektime('510')">0:08:30</a> with the lowest generation is wise  
<a onclick="modifyYTiframeseektime('514')">0:08:34</a> but also these have various  
<a onclick="modifyYTiframeseektime('516')">0:08:36</a> disagreements and various conflicts and  
<a onclick="modifyYTiframeseektime('518')">0:08:38</a> various talents and various things so  
<a onclick="modifyYTiframeseektime('520')">0:08:40</a> they escape to the sahaba  
<a onclick="modifyYTiframeseektime('522')">0:08:42</a> and then you have the problem with the  
<a onclick="modifyYTiframeseektime('524')">0:08:44</a> definition who is also happy  
<a onclick="modifyYTiframeseektime('527')">0:08:47</a> there was no clear definition even even  
<a onclick="modifyYTiframeseektime('529')">0:08:49</a> the the Tiberian and the sahaba did not  
<a onclick="modifyYTiframeseektime('531')">0:08:51</a> have a clear definition for example they  
<a onclick="modifyYTiframeseektime('534')">0:08:54</a> got the best and the great of tabby and  
<a onclick="modifyYTiframeseektime('536')">0:08:56</a> the most Pious and maybe in Hadith  
<a onclick="modifyYTiframeseektime('538')">0:08:58</a> sounds more exact thing I would say  
<a onclick="modifyYTiframeseektime('540')">0:09:00</a> shabby is more exact thing of narrative  
<a onclick="modifyYTiframeseektime('543')">0:09:03</a> and more sharp in The Knowing men but of  
<a onclick="modifyYTiframeseektime('546')">0:09:06</a> course I don't say was more more Pious  
<a onclick="modifyYTiframeseektime('547')">0:09:07</a> and more pure-hearted but more  
<a onclick="modifyYTiframeseektime('549')">0:09:09</a> straightforward and to know the men and  
<a onclick="modifyYTiframeseektime('551')">0:09:11</a> concise them and analyze them you need  
<a onclick="modifyYTiframeseektime('553')">0:09:13</a> to be a little bit more a man of  
<a onclick="modifyYTiframeseektime('555')">0:09:15</a> political insight and Analysis of  
<a onclick="modifyYTiframeseektime('557')">0:09:17</a> personality so shall be superior shall  
<a onclick="modifyYTiframeseektime('560')">0:09:20</a> we say I took from a trustworthy source  
<a onclick="modifyYTiframeseektime('562')">0:09:22</a> and mentioned the name of the source  
<a onclick="modifyYTiframeseektime('564')">0:09:24</a> then you can realize really translated  
<a onclick="modifyYTiframeseektime('565')">0:09:25</a> them thoroughly always a human being he  
<a onclick="modifyYTiframeseektime('568')">0:09:28</a> may made a failure here and there  
<a onclick="modifyYTiframeseektime('570')">0:09:30</a> sometimes  
<a onclick="modifyYTiframeseektime('572')">0:09:32</a> uh side woman said is regarded the same  
<a onclick="modifyYTiframeseektime('575')">0:09:35</a> category but because he's someone who is  
<a onclick="modifyYTiframeseektime('577')">0:09:37</a> straightforward and trusting he may be  
<a onclick="modifyYTiframeseektime('579')">0:09:39</a> misled or fooled by someone thinking  
<a onclick="modifyYTiframeseektime('581')">0:09:41</a> he's trustworthy is not  
<a onclick="modifyYTiframeseektime('583')">0:09:43</a> that's depending on how to analyze men  
<a onclick="modifyYTiframeseektime('585')">0:09:45</a> and the character but I'm just  
<a onclick="modifyYTiframeseektime('586')">0:09:46</a> mentioning that as a casual information  
<a onclick="modifyYTiframeseektime('588')">0:09:48</a> aside from the same say asahabi is the  
<a onclick="modifyYTiframeseektime('590')">0:09:50</a> one who stayed with a prophet one one  
<a onclick="modifyYTiframeseektime('593')">0:09:53</a> year or two years or participated in one  
<a onclick="modifyYTiframeseektime('596')">0:09:56</a> or two battle campaigns with him so he  
<a onclick="modifyYTiframeseektime('598')">0:09:58</a> regard anyone anything less than one  
<a onclick="modifyYTiframeseektime('600')">0:10:00</a> year anything like less than one battle  
<a onclick="modifyYTiframeseektime('603')">0:10:03</a> campaign as not enough to be a Sahari  
<a onclick="modifyYTiframeseektime('608')">0:10:08</a> that that will create a problem for many  
<a onclick="modifyYTiframeseektime('610')">0:10:10</a> with the regardless so happy many of the  
<a onclick="modifyYTiframeseektime('613')">0:10:13</a> plenty of knowledge of people who are  
<a onclick="modifyYTiframeseektime('615')">0:10:15</a> not according to definition some people  
<a onclick="modifyYTiframeseektime('617')">0:10:17</a> say no he must have attended at least  
<a onclick="modifyYTiframeseektime('619')">0:10:19</a> three battle uh  
<a onclick="modifyYTiframeseektime('621')">0:10:21</a> combat Etc somebody say it has to be a  
<a onclick="modifyYTiframeseektime('624')">0:10:24</a> resident of Madina like answer Marcos  
<a onclick="modifyYTiframeseektime('626')">0:10:26</a> asked is there any sahabilities because  
<a onclick="modifyYTiframeseektime('628')">0:10:28</a> you stayed until High age I think he  
<a onclick="modifyYTiframeseektime('631')">0:10:31</a> maybe he outlives that high judge maybe  
<a onclick="modifyYTiframeseektime('632')">0:10:32</a> he died 95 degrees  
<a onclick="modifyYTiframeseektime('634')">0:10:34</a> and high age say they ask him in high  
<a onclick="modifyYTiframeseektime('637')">0:10:37</a> age is that it is a happy lift  
<a onclick="modifyYTiframeseektime('639')">0:10:39</a> besides you so no no there's none except  
<a onclick="modifyYTiframeseektime('642')">0:10:42</a> maybe some Bedouins so he didn't regard  
<a onclick="modifyYTiframeseektime('644')">0:10:44</a> them asahabi they saw him between  
<a onclick="modifyYTiframeseektime('647')">0:10:47</a> so for him you have to be combining him  
<a onclick="modifyYTiframeseektime('650')">0:10:50</a> in Medina for a certain time  
<a onclick="modifyYTiframeseektime('653')">0:10:53</a> so that's again the division of sahabi  
<a onclick="modifyYTiframeseektime('655')">0:10:55</a> because we We Know by from the statement  
<a onclick="modifyYTiframeseektime('657')">0:10:57</a> if we if she shows any definition  
<a onclick="modifyYTiframeseektime('660')">0:11:00</a> whatsoever they will be under them on a  
<a onclick="modifyYTiframeseektime('663')">0:11:03</a> 15 by the clear and fundamental text of  
<a onclick="modifyYTiframeseektime('665')">0:11:05</a> the Quran  
<a onclick="modifyYTiframeseektime('695')">0:11:35</a> we know them  
<a onclick="modifyYTiframeseektime('698')">0:11:38</a> we will punish them twice and Dunya and  
<a onclick="modifyYTiframeseektime('700')">0:11:40</a> they won't be returned to enormous  
<a onclick="modifyYTiframeseektime('702')">0:11:42</a> punishment meaning they will die cover  
<a onclick="modifyYTiframeseektime('704')">0:11:44</a> otherwise did not know them  
<a onclick="modifyYTiframeseektime('706')">0:11:46</a> those in Medina are most likely  
<a onclick="modifyYTiframeseektime('708')">0:11:48</a> interacting we know some of them by name  
<a onclick="modifyYTiframeseektime('710')">0:11:50</a> one of them at least alone who is known  
<a onclick="modifyYTiframeseektime('712')">0:11:52</a> as the one after nobody but he  
<a onclick="modifyYTiframeseektime('714')">0:11:54</a> participated the battle campaigns he  
<a onclick="modifyYTiframeseektime('716')">0:11:56</a> initiated the story of the Afghan attack  
<a onclick="modifyYTiframeseektime('718')">0:11:58</a> against Asha all of this and he is the  
<a onclick="modifyYTiframeseektime('720')">0:12:00</a> one who said in his private circles now  
<a onclick="modifyYTiframeseektime('722')">0:12:02</a> that's the end we are we adopted  
<a onclick="modifyYTiframeseektime('724')">0:12:04</a> Muhammad and gave him protection and  
<a onclick="modifyYTiframeseektime('726')">0:12:06</a> make him fat and now according to the

<a onclick="modifyYTiframeseektime('730')">0:12:10</a> you meaning Muhammad is a dog  
<a onclick="modifyYTiframeseektime('732')">0:12:12</a> and he denied that saying that but the  
<a onclick="modifyYTiframeseektime('734')">0:12:14</a> Quran explores him  
<a onclick="modifyYTiframeseektime('736')">0:12:16</a> so we have that so there's no Escape  
<a onclick="modifyYTiframeseektime('739')">0:12:19</a> there's various  
<a onclick="modifyYTiframeseektime('741')">0:12:21</a> at this point just just to put the setup

<a onclick="modifyYTiframeseektime('866')">0:14:26</a> so the companion is kept in the Arabic

<a onclick="modifyYTiframeseektime('869')">0:14:29</a> someone going with you on about on a  
<a onclick="modifyYTiframeseektime('873')">0:14:33</a> trip is a companion some your wife is

<a onclick="modifyYTiframeseektime('877')">0:14:37</a> says  
<a onclick="modifyYTiframeseektime('881')">0:14:41</a> is a companion so he kept it in the  
<a onclick="modifyYTiframeseektime('884')">0:14:44</a> linguistic meaning so all these  
<a onclick="modifyYTiframeseektime('885')">0:14:45</a> definitions are wavering and they're not  
<a onclick="modifyYTiframeseektime('887')">0:14:47</a> wearing anything for Fruitful  
<a onclick="modifyYTiframeseektime('889')">0:14:49</a> is very well known we know that from  
<a onclick="modifyYTiframeseektime('892')">0:14:52</a> various historic reasons  
<a onclick="modifyYTiframeseektime('895')">0:14:55</a> they want to get Maui to have the honor

<a onclick="modifyYTiframeseektime('901')">0:15:01</a> will not succeed that's just a Prelude  
<a onclick="modifyYTiframeseektime('903')">0:15:03</a> so salaf is not well defined and even  
<a onclick="modifyYTiframeseektime('906')">0:15:06</a> the companion is not clearly well  
<a onclick="modifyYTiframeseektime('907')">0:15:07</a> defined  
<a onclick="modifyYTiframeseektime('909')">0:15:09</a> secondly okay say they say the sahaba  
<a onclick="modifyYTiframeseektime('912')">0:15:12</a> were around the prophet  
<a onclick="modifyYTiframeseektime('913')">0:15:13</a> and they saw the revelation of the Quran  
<a onclick="modifyYTiframeseektime('916')">0:15:16</a> Etc  
<a onclick="modifyYTiframeseektime('917')">0:15:17</a> and they are most of them except a few  
<a onclick="modifyYTiframeseektime('920')">0:15:20</a> which do not count five six seven are  
<a onclick="modifyYTiframeseektime('923')">0:15:23</a> not Arabic speaker Arabic speaker so  
<a onclick="modifyYTiframeseektime('927')">0:15:27</a> they answered the Arabic language better  
<a onclick="modifyYTiframeseektime('928')">0:15:28</a> than us by Nature they are born in  
<a onclick="modifyYTiframeseektime('930')">0:15:30</a> Arabic language we we have to learn it  
<a onclick="modifyYTiframeseektime('931')">0:15:31</a> by effort as a foreign language for us  
<a onclick="modifyYTiframeseektime('934')">0:15:34</a> now I mean the high Arabic Arabic even  
<a onclick="modifyYTiframeseektime('936')">0:15:36</a> myself  
<a onclick="modifyYTiframeseektime('938')">0:15:38</a> is a direct not a high Arabic so I have  
<a onclick="modifyYTiframeseektime('942')">0:15:42</a> to learn Safari language it's easy  
<a onclick="modifyYTiframeseektime('944')">0:15:44</a> obviously because the direct is close  
<a onclick="modifyYTiframeseektime('945')">0:15:45</a> but still I have to learn it but the one  
<a onclick="modifyYTiframeseektime('948')">0:15:48</a> born in it it is done in his blood he  
<a onclick="modifyYTiframeseektime('950')">0:15:50</a> has the taste of it so based on that  
<a onclick="modifyYTiframeseektime('952')">0:15:52</a> their understanding mystery must be the  
<a onclick="modifyYTiframeseektime('954')">0:15:54</a> best of understanding  
<a onclick="modifyYTiframeseektime('956')">0:15:56</a> but again a fallacy first one because  
<a onclick="modifyYTiframeseektime('959')">0:15:59</a> understanding is related to Satan not  
<a onclick="modifyYTiframeseektime('961')">0:16:01</a> only understanding Arabic and being with  
<a onclick="modifyYTiframeseektime('963')">0:16:03</a> the prophet is related to the certain  
<a onclick="modifyYTiframeseektime('965')">0:16:05</a> mental and intellectual capabilities not  
<a onclick="modifyYTiframeseektime('968')">0:16:08</a> everyone is having  
<a onclick="modifyYTiframeseektime('970')">0:16:10</a> and depth of understanding and we have  
<a onclick="modifyYTiframeseektime('972')">0:16:12</a> many evidences that many of the  
<a onclick="modifyYTiframeseektime('973')">0:16:13</a> companions were quite simple-minded and  
<a onclick="modifyYTiframeseektime('975')">0:16:15</a> very Shadow it doesn't mean it doesn't  
<a onclick="modifyYTiframeseektime('978')">0:16:18</a> stain them because their virtue is being  
<a onclick="modifyYTiframeseektime('980')">0:16:20</a> that they are  
<a onclick="modifyYTiframeseektime('986')">0:16:26</a> secondly they are sincere and they are  
<a onclick="modifyYTiframeseektime('988')">0:16:28</a> willing to sacrifice their life on their  
<a onclick="modifyYTiframeseektime('990')">0:16:30</a> wealth for Islam that's what gave them  
<a onclick="modifyYTiframeseektime('992')">0:16:32</a> the virtue  
<a onclick="modifyYTiframeseektime('993')">0:16:33</a> High virtue not that they are better  
<a onclick="modifyYTiframeseektime('995')">0:16:35</a> understanding and evidence show that  
<a onclick="modifyYTiframeseektime('997')">0:16:37</a> give you just one example just casual  
<a onclick="modifyYTiframeseektime('999')">0:16:39</a> example for the reason that they don't  
<a onclick="modifyYTiframeseektime('1000')">0:16:40</a> know these things for example in one  
<a onclick="modifyYTiframeseektime('1002')">0:16:42</a> Hadith where is  
<a onclick="modifyYTiframeseektime('1004')">0:16:44</a> casually  
<a onclick="modifyYTiframeseektime('1005')">0:16:45</a> related to khilafa and election and so  
<a onclick="modifyYTiframeseektime('1008')">0:16:48</a> on Asians we were in in in in in in  
<a onclick="modifyYTiframeseektime('1011')">0:16:51</a> Mina with Omar in his last bill garment  
<a onclick="modifyYTiframeseektime('1014')">0:16:54</a> before he died  
<a onclick="modifyYTiframeseektime('1016')">0:16:56</a> and someone and I was imagine even Abbas  
<a onclick="modifyYTiframeseektime('1020')">0:17:00</a> who was just coming out of age when the  
<a onclick="modifyYTiframeseektime('1022')">0:17:02</a> prophet died because he was just coming  
<a onclick="modifyYTiframeseektime('1024')">0:17:04</a> up to age we know the other narrations  
<a onclick="modifyYTiframeseektime('1026')">0:17:06</a> foreign  
<a onclick="modifyYTiframeseektime('1054')">0:17:34</a> so it's not it's not this is a fallacy  
<a onclick="modifyYTiframeseektime('1057')">0:17:37</a> but also in his final sermon said  
<a onclick="modifyYTiframeseektime('1061')">0:17:41</a> those who have this heard me  
<a onclick="modifyYTiframeseektime('1065')">0:17:45</a> they should report what they hid as they

<a onclick="modifyYTiframeseektime('1069')">0:17:49</a> may Allah make the face beautiful with  
<a onclick="modifyYTiframeseektime('1071')">0:17:51</a> the one who hear what I say

<a onclick="modifyYTiframeseektime('1075')">0:17:55</a> other people who are not present here  
<a onclick="modifyYTiframeseektime('1077')">0:17:57</a> including people in the future because  
<a onclick="modifyYTiframeseektime('1081')">0:18:01</a> maybe someone receiving the message  
<a onclick="modifyYTiframeseektime('1083')">0:18:03</a> comprehend it better and make sense  
<a onclick="modifyYTiframeseektime('1085')">0:18:05</a> better of it than the one who hears it  
<a onclick="modifyYTiframeseektime('1087')">0:18:07</a> now  
<a onclick="modifyYTiframeseektime('1088')">0:18:08</a> so even that refused that  
<a onclick="modifyYTiframeseektime('1091')">0:18:11</a> so this is a fallacy  
<a onclick="modifyYTiframeseektime('1093')">0:18:13</a> secondly what's meaning the self the  
<a onclick="modifyYTiframeseektime('1095')">0:18:15</a> idea the point of view yourself  
<a onclick="modifyYTiframeseektime('1097')">0:18:17</a> because they have we have absolute  
<a onclick="modifyYTiframeseektime('1100')">0:18:20</a> evidence that they agree disagreed and  
<a onclick="modifyYTiframeseektime('1102')">0:18:22</a> many issue some of them very substantial  
<a onclick="modifyYTiframeseektime('1103')">0:18:23</a> like personal disagree disagree Edition

<a onclick="modifyYTiframeseektime('1111')">0:18:31</a> and it came to a dispute until even

<a onclick="modifyYTiframeseektime('1118')">0:18:38</a> and the coward in Islam I am not going

<a onclick="modifyYTiframeseektime('1124')">0:18:44</a> until they pay it's not allowable

<a onclick="modifyYTiframeseektime('1134')">0:18:54</a> many other disagreement so what does  
<a onclick="modifyYTiframeseektime('1137')">0:18:57</a> this mean the point of view

<a onclick="modifyYTiframeseektime('1475')">0:24:35</a> wanted the booty they wanted the the the  
<a onclick="modifyYTiframeseektime('1477')">0:24:37</a> money coming from from the Alonso and  
<a onclick="modifyYTiframeseektime('1480')">0:24:40</a> the Quran fast  
<a onclick="modifyYTiframeseektime('1482')">0:24:42</a> foreign  
<a onclick="modifyYTiframeseektime('1488')">0:24:48</a> and he said you you want to Dunya you  
<a onclick="modifyYTiframeseektime('1490')">0:24:50</a> did not give the cesare advice  
<a onclick="modifyYTiframeseektime('1492')">0:24:52</a> because you want to Dunya this is the

<a onclick="modifyYTiframeseektime('1498')">0:24:58</a> so it's very important to recognize and  
<a onclick="modifyYTiframeseektime('1500')">0:25:00</a> and particular sahaba in this slide to  
<a onclick="modifyYTiframeseektime('1503')">0:25:03</a> everyone makes it feasible around to

<a onclick="modifyYTiframeseektime('1507')">0:25:07</a> them at this but if you have them like  
<a onclick="modifyYTiframeseektime('1509')">0:25:09</a> engines who have come down and you may  
<a onclick="modifyYTiframeseektime('1511')">0:25:11</a> ask yourself do they really where they  
<a onclick="modifyYTiframeseektime('1513')">0:25:13</a> go into the toilet where they defecating  
<a onclick="modifyYTiframeseektime('1515')">0:25:15</a> and urinating yes they were maybe maybe  
<a onclick="modifyYTiframeseektime('1518')">0:25:18</a> the edification was smelling like like

<a onclick="modifyYTiframeseektime('1523')">0:25:23</a> like I was so this way they come closer

<a onclick="modifyYTiframeseektime('1528')">0:25:28</a> similar to them in piety meaning in

<a onclick="modifyYTiframeseektime('1745')">0:29:05</a> it should be obvious  
<a onclick="modifyYTiframeseektime('1749')">0:29:09</a> so there's two events and many other  
<a onclick="modifyYTiframeseektime('1751')">0:29:11</a> events like that happening at the time  
<a onclick="modifyYTiframeseektime('1753')">0:29:13</a> of the Prophet so it's not not matter of  
<a onclick="modifyYTiframeseektime('1755')">0:29:15</a> going so this is the fallacy but it is  
<a onclick="modifyYTiframeseektime('1757')">0:29:17</a> present at such a way to companion  
<a onclick="modifyYTiframeseektime('1759')">0:29:19</a> there seems to be angels  
<a onclick="modifyYTiframeseektime('1763')">0:29:23</a> coming from Heaven this is from another  
<a onclick="modifyYTiframeseektime('1765')">0:29:25</a> world they don't they were not living  
<a onclick="modifyYTiframeseektime('1766')">0:29:26</a> there maybe they're not even walking  
<a onclick="modifyYTiframeseektime('1768')">0:29:28</a> maybe they were flying in the air and  
<a onclick="modifyYTiframeseektime('1770')">0:29:30</a> things like that but that's where you  
<a onclick="modifyYTiframeseektime('1771')">0:29:31</a> have an imaginary picture of something  
<a onclick="modifyYTiframeseektime('1773')">0:29:33</a> which is not real with the with the  
<a onclick="modifyYTiframeseektime('1775')">0:29:35</a> purpose intent to pass my own statement  
<a onclick="modifyYTiframeseektime('1778')">0:29:38</a> and my honest they had all my own  
<a onclick="modifyYTiframeseektime('1781')">0:29:41</a> misconceptions as the one coming from  
<a onclick="modifyYTiframeseektime('1783')">0:29:43</a> their self  
<a onclick="modifyYTiframeseektime('1784')">0:29:44</a> in reality it is not coming from itself  
<a onclick="modifyYTiframeseektime('1786')">0:29:46</a> and even discovering themselves it must  
<a onclick="modifyYTiframeseektime('1788')">0:29:48</a> have been disagreement about that  
<a onclick="modifyYTiframeseektime('1791')">0:29:51</a> check but here's another thing I mean  
<a onclick="modifyYTiframeseektime('1792')">0:29:52</a> there's one thing about  
<a onclick="modifyYTiframeseektime('1794')">0:29:54</a> silk  
<a onclick="modifyYTiframeseektime('1795')">0:29:55</a> what they tend to record on the market  
<a onclick="modifyYTiframeseektime('1797')">0:29:57</a> on is around the issue of Akita so what  
<a onclick="modifyYTiframeseektime('1799')">0:29:59</a> they're obviously the  
<a onclick="modifyYTiframeseektime('1801')">0:30:01</a> Theta Vida and obviously obvious of that  
<a onclick="modifyYTiframeseektime('1805')">0:30:05</a> great version but the thing is this so  
<a onclick="modifyYTiframeseektime('1808')">0:30:08</a> by building so obviously for us belief  
<a onclick="modifyYTiframeseektime('1811')">0:30:11</a> is a fundamental component you know to  
<a onclick="modifyYTiframeseektime('1813')">0:30:13</a> be a Muslim one of the fundamental uh  
<a onclick="modifyYTiframeseektime('1815')">0:30:15</a> aren't having the right belief so they  
<a onclick="modifyYTiframeseektime('1818')">0:30:18</a> just obviously  
<a onclick="modifyYTiframeseektime('1820')">0:30:20</a> again there's a fallacy developed a  
<a onclick="modifyYTiframeseektime('1823')">0:30:23</a> history and the people swallowed it down  
<a onclick="modifyYTiframeseektime('1829')">0:30:29</a> talk about Iman  
<a onclick="modifyYTiframeseektime('1832')">0:30:32</a> Iman is not just Akita a set of reports  
<a onclick="modifyYTiframeseektime('1836')">0:30:36</a> which you you believe they are true no  
<a onclick="modifyYTiframeseektime('1839')">0:30:39</a> that's not him this is yakim and this  
<a onclick="modifyYTiframeseektime('1843')">0:30:43</a> has nothing to do with the Iman ifs is  
<a onclick="modifyYTiframeseektime('1845')">0:30:45</a> the base of the Iman you have you have  
<a onclick="modifyYTiframeseektime('1846')">0:30:46</a> to do translinkual things which have  
<a onclick="modifyYTiframeseektime('1848')">0:30:48</a> come from Allah or dictated by the  
<a onclick="modifyYTiframeseektime('1849')">0:30:49</a> system of reason  
<a onclick="modifyYTiframeseektime('1851')">0:30:51</a> but that's not  
<a onclick="modifyYTiframeseektime('1852')">0:30:52</a> you have to accept it and make your life  
<a onclick="modifyYTiframeseektime('1854')">0:30:54</a> according to it Daniel you are done you  
<a onclick="modifyYTiframeseektime('1857')">0:30:57</a> are movement before that you are just  
<a onclick="modifyYTiframeseektime('1859')">0:30:59</a> Musa for example read the Quran who  
<a onclick="modifyYTiframeseektime('1862')">0:31:02</a> talks about the people of course  
<a onclick="modifyYTiframeseektime('1871')">0:31:11</a> they have absolute conviction this is  
<a onclick="modifyYTiframeseektime('1874')">0:31:14</a> the truth but they reject the same  
<a onclick="modifyYTiframeseektime('1876')">0:31:16</a> what's going to follow us a couple of  
<a onclick="modifyYTiframeseektime('1878')">0:31:18</a> slaves  
<a onclick="modifyYTiframeseektime('1879')">0:31:19</a> and that Nation slaves under us which we  
<a onclick="modifyYTiframeseektime('1882')">0:31:22</a> can Slaughter our kill as well and take  
<a onclick="modifyYTiframeseektime('1884')">0:31:24</a> the woman with ever for servants or  
<a onclick="modifyYTiframeseektime('1885')">0:31:25</a> whatever and and then two of those come  
<a onclick="modifyYTiframeseektime('1888')">0:31:28</a> and claim to be messenger of God and we  
<a onclick="modifyYTiframeseektime('1890')">0:31:30</a> are supposed to follow them no that's  
<a onclick="modifyYTiframeseektime('1892')">0:31:32</a> what they said although this is wrong  
<a onclick="modifyYTiframeseektime('1899')">0:31:39</a> let's say it's a convention  
<a onclick="modifyYTiframeseektime('1901')">0:31:41</a> scholarly conversation okay actually  
<a onclick="modifyYTiframeseektime('1902')">0:31:42</a> that is what the heart has been about  
<a onclick="modifyYTiframeseektime('1904')">0:31:44</a> from not the heart is not enough is  
<a onclick="modifyYTiframeseektime('1908')">0:31:48</a> convicted about that that's not enough  
<a onclick="modifyYTiframeseektime('1909')">0:31:49</a> it has to be more to become Iman but  
<a onclick="modifyYTiframeseektime('1912')">0:31:52</a> let's go to that what's that shall be  
<a onclick="modifyYTiframeseektime('1914')">0:31:54</a> noted about  
<a onclick="modifyYTiframeseektime('1915')">0:31:55</a> is that what allow order to know with  
<a onclick="modifyYTiframeseektime('1918')">0:31:58</a> statitute in the Quran says  
<a onclick="modifyYTiframeseektime('1924')">0:32:04</a> no it's attitude that Allah knows  
<a onclick="modifyYTiframeseektime('1926')">0:32:06</a> everything and is comprehensive in  
<a onclick="modifyYTiframeseektime('1928')">0:32:08</a> knowledge  
<a onclick="modifyYTiframeseektime('1929')">0:32:09</a> it's capable of doing everything  
<a onclick="modifyYTiframeseektime('1931')">0:32:11</a> knowledge no will certainly do this and  
<a onclick="modifyYTiframeseektime('1934')">0:32:14</a> this and this the Quran did not leave it  
<a onclick="modifyYTiframeseektime('1936')">0:32:16</a> open and another place is specified what  
<a onclick="modifyYTiframeseektime('1938')">0:32:18</a> should be believed on  
<a onclick="modifyYTiframeseektime('1940')">0:32:20</a> for example foreign  
<a onclick="modifyYTiframeseektime('1952')">0:32:32</a> he has gone astray far away so these are  
<a onclick="modifyYTiframeseektime('1955')">0:32:35</a> the the main portion of Iman  
<a onclick="modifyYTiframeseektime('1958')">0:32:38</a> but nobody disagree with Muslim there so  
<a onclick="modifyYTiframeseektime('1960')">0:32:40</a> they they they got stuck or got involved  
<a onclick="modifyYTiframeseektime('1963')">0:32:43</a> somehow and secondary issues of  
<a onclick="modifyYTiframeseektime('1966')">0:32:46</a> uh related like for example what's  
<a onclick="modifyYTiframeseektime('1970')">0:32:50</a> really  
<a onclick="modifyYTiframeseektime('1972')">0:32:52</a> Allah created the heavens in six days  
<a onclick="modifyYTiframeseektime('1974')">0:32:54</a> and after that he mounted the throne  
<a onclick="modifyYTiframeseektime('1975')">0:32:55</a> what does it mean mounted  
<a onclick="modifyYTiframeseektime('1978')">0:32:58</a> uh  
<a onclick="modifyYTiframeseektime('1980')">0:33:00</a> some people said it can't be the  
<a onclick="modifyYTiframeseektime('1982')">0:33:02</a> physical reality because Allah is our is  
<a onclick="modifyYTiframeseektime('1985')">0:33:05</a> outside as a space he cannot be located  
<a onclick="modifyYTiframeseektime('1987')">0:33:07</a> in a place and that's impossible  
<a onclick="modifyYTiframeseektime('1990')">0:33:10</a> because if he can be in a place he must  
<a onclick="modifyYTiframeseektime('1992')">0:33:12</a> be in every place otherwise you'll  
<a onclick="modifyYTiframeseektime('1994')">0:33:14</a> notice is existing  
<a onclick="modifyYTiframeseektime('1997')">0:33:17</a> and then they indulge in these things  
<a onclick="modifyYTiframeseektime('1999')">0:33:19</a> this is maybe a philosophical discussion  
<a onclick="modifyYTiframeseektime('2000')">0:33:20</a> should not be a matter of Akita yeah  
<a onclick="modifyYTiframeseektime('2002')">0:33:22</a> maybe Scholars can discuss that in  
<a onclick="modifyYTiframeseektime('2004')">0:33:24</a> Academia but you should not even ask  
<a onclick="modifyYTiframeseektime('2006')">0:33:26</a> Muslims common Muslim to to have an  
<a onclick="modifyYTiframeseektime('2008')">0:33:28</a> opinion they say  
<a onclick="modifyYTiframeseektime('2010')">0:33:30</a> just just take it as it appears and if  
<a onclick="modifyYTiframeseektime('2012')">0:33:32</a> you have a mental image whatever mental  
<a onclick="modifyYTiframeseektime('2014')">0:33:34</a> image come in your mind like someone  
<a onclick="modifyYTiframeseektime('2016')">0:33:36</a> sitting on a chair this is just your  
<a onclick="modifyYTiframeseektime('2018')">0:33:38</a> your limited imagination as a human  
<a onclick="modifyYTiframeseektime('2020')">0:33:40</a> being and you are forgiven Allah phrase  
<a onclick="modifyYTiframeseektime('2022')">0:33:42</a> this way so that you can have this  
<a onclick="modifyYTiframeseektime('2023')">0:33:43</a> imagination in your mind but know Allah  
<a onclick="modifyYTiframeseektime('2025')">0:33:45</a> is different but that's enough for  
<a onclick="modifyYTiframeseektime('2027')">0:33:47</a> common people how do you drive at that  
<a onclick="modifyYTiframeseektime('2028')">0:33:48</a> conclusion for example how do you derive  
<a onclick="modifyYTiframeseektime('2031')">0:33:51</a> that because they build a narrative in  
<a onclick="modifyYTiframeseektime('2034')">0:33:54</a> terms of this is what you must know  
<a onclick="modifyYTiframeseektime('2035')">0:33:55</a> Muslims must know this place  
<a onclick="modifyYTiframeseektime('2038')">0:33:58</a> that's inventing that's not what the  
<a onclick="modifyYTiframeseektime('2040')">0:34:00</a> Quran made an injunction  
<a onclick="modifyYTiframeseektime('2048')">0:34:08</a> and you come casually to it for example  
<a onclick="modifyYTiframeseektime('2051')">0:34:11</a> that the wife of an azizian of Egypt uh  
<a onclick="modifyYTiframeseektime('2054')">0:34:14</a> tried to seduce Yusuf this is a fact  
<a onclick="modifyYTiframeseektime('2056')">0:34:16</a> this is the fact she tried to reduce  
<a onclick="modifyYTiframeseektime('2058')">0:34:18</a> user and he almost fell but he recovered  
<a onclick="modifyYTiframeseektime('2061')">0:34:21</a> and ran away fine if you say no that's  
<a onclick="modifyYTiframeseektime('2063')">0:34:23</a> not true you are a cafe because you have  
<a onclick="modifyYTiframeseektime('2065')">0:34:25</a> declared the Quran to be false but is  
<a onclick="modifyYTiframeseektime('2066')">0:34:26</a> that part of the Akida should they stand  
<a onclick="modifyYTiframeseektime('2068')">0:34:28</a> in the door of the mosque and ask you do  
<a onclick="modifyYTiframeseektime('2070')">0:34:30</a> you know what the wife of uh did to  
<a onclick="modifyYTiframeseektime('2073')">0:34:33</a> yourself  
<a onclick="modifyYTiframeseektime('2076')">0:34:36</a> obliged to know that but if you come  
<a onclick="modifyYTiframeseektime('2078')">0:34:38</a> casually fine you don't put that in  
<a onclick="modifyYTiframeseektime('2080')">0:34:40</a> arcade books even if there are Akita  
<a onclick="modifyYTiframeseektime('2082')">0:34:42</a> books it doesn't mention this or they  
<a onclick="modifyYTiframeseektime('2084')">0:34:44</a> should be in that according to the  
<a onclick="modifyYTiframeseektime('2085')">0:34:45</a> division  
<a onclick="modifyYTiframeseektime('2086')">0:34:46</a> they got stuck in problems which their  
<a onclick="modifyYTiframeseektime('2090')">0:34:50</a> ancient School especially

<a onclick="modifyYTiframeseektime('2095')">0:34:55</a> because the people of Hadith and  
<a onclick="modifyYTiframeseektime('2096')">0:34:56</a> narration  
<a onclick="modifyYTiframeseektime('2098')">0:34:58</a> but they gave certain answers which are  
<a onclick="modifyYTiframeseektime('2101')">0:35:01</a> most likely false and they want to  
<a onclick="modifyYTiframeseektime('2103')">0:35:03</a> connect that ID and declare your deviant

<a onclick="modifyYTiframeseektime('2108')">0:35:08</a> they wanted that's what has happened to

<a onclick="modifyYTiframeseektime('2111')">0:35:11</a> that's what happened with historical  
<a onclick="modifyYTiframeseektime('2113')">0:35:13</a> so that's what they care now if it comes  
<a onclick="modifyYTiframeseektime('2115')">0:35:15</a> to check now the hobby is having the the

<a onclick="modifyYTiframeseektime('2260')">0:37:40</a> we don't take care of the capital  
<a onclick="modifyYTiframeseektime('2261')">0:37:41</a> because the the fundamental principle is

<a onclick="modifyYTiframeseektime('2265')">0:37:45</a> which necessary doesn't mean that you  
<a onclick="modifyYTiframeseektime('2268')">0:37:48</a> are a Catholic because  
<a onclick="modifyYTiframeseektime('2269')">0:37:49</a> that maybe you know you're not aware  
<a onclick="modifyYTiframeseektime('2271')">0:37:51</a> that it is couple you did not do the

<a onclick="modifyYTiframeseektime('2276')">0:37:56</a> am at able to tell you your point of

<a onclick="modifyYTiframeseektime('2281')">0:38:01</a> because if you defend worship like this  
<a onclick="modifyYTiframeseektime('2283')">0:38:03</a> acts meaning if you direct that up to  
<a onclick="modifyYTiframeseektime('2284')">0:38:04</a> the banner for example you made the  
<a onclick="modifyYTiframeseektime('2286')">0:38:06</a> banner identity beside Allah that's it  
<a onclick="modifyYTiframeseektime('2290')">0:38:10</a> you adopt the god beside Allah so  
<a onclick="modifyYTiframeseektime('2298')">0:38:18</a> identity is something which is worshiped  
<a onclick="modifyYTiframeseektime('2301')">0:38:21</a> that's his definition  
<a onclick="modifyYTiframeseektime('2302')">0:38:22</a> that meaning Allah was not worshiping  
<a onclick="modifyYTiframeseektime('2305')">0:38:25</a> Eternity for any creation so he was not  
<a onclick="modifyYTiframeseektime('2306')">0:38:26</a> a deity in that

<a onclick="modifyYTiframeseektime('2314')">0:38:34</a> stop and start wavering and knowing what  
<a onclick="modifyYTiframeseektime('2316')">0:38:36</a> they say I hate to tell the people that  
<a onclick="modifyYTiframeseektime('2318')">0:38:38</a> your point of view is ending and cover  
<a onclick="modifyYTiframeseektime('2320')">0:38:40</a> but sometimes you are forced to say that  
<a onclick="modifyYTiframeseektime('2323')">0:38:43</a> they are  
<a onclick="modifyYTiframeseektime('2332')">0:38:52</a> not qualified to do these conclusions  
<a onclick="modifyYTiframeseektime('2336')">0:38:56</a> so can you explain a bit more so  
<a onclick="modifyYTiframeseektime('2339')">0:38:59</a> for them Anila is something that is  
<a onclick="modifyYTiframeseektime('2341')">0:39:01</a> worship and in the absence of it being  
<a onclick="modifyYTiframeseektime('2343')">0:39:03</a> worshiped it ceases because the

<a onclick="modifyYTiframeseektime('2347')">0:39:07</a> haven't expressed it as such as

<a onclick="modifyYTiframeseektime('2361')">0:39:21</a> by the way it's not interested but it

<a onclick="modifyYTiframeseektime('3146')">0:52:26</a> in full in Arabic the path is translated

<a onclick="modifyYTiframeseektime('3158')">0:52:38</a> very much because at the time and this  
<a onclick="modifyYTiframeseektime('3160')">0:52:40</a> time Islamic scholarship was at the  
<a onclick="modifyYTiframeseektime('3162')">0:52:42</a> bottom  
<a onclick="modifyYTiframeseektime('3163')">0:52:43</a> Islamic scholarship was increasing and  
<a onclick="modifyYTiframeseektime('3165')">0:52:45</a> advancing until let's say the fifth  
<a onclick="modifyYTiframeseektime('3167')">0:52:47</a> Islamic Century roughly with more  
<a onclick="modifyYTiframeseektime('3169')">0:52:49</a> elaboration and development then slowly  
<a onclick="modifyYTiframeseektime('3171')">0:52:51</a> it started stagnating I said maybe three  
<a onclick="modifyYTiframeseektime('3174')">0:52:54</a> four centuries and same level up to even  
<a onclick="modifyYTiframeseektime('3176')">0:52:56</a> tell me and afternoon  
<a onclick="modifyYTiframeseektime('3179')">0:52:59</a> just just  
<a onclick="modifyYTiframeseektime('3181')">0:53:01</a> collecting things but nothing really  
<a onclick="modifyYTiframeseektime('3183')">0:53:03</a> creative even few creations with Emir  
<a onclick="modifyYTiframeseektime('3186')">0:53:06</a> are not that genuinely creative and then  
<a onclick="modifyYTiframeseektime('3188')">0:53:08</a> after that started declining  
<a onclick="modifyYTiframeseektime('3190')">0:53:10</a> genuinely declining  
<a onclick="modifyYTiframeseektime('3193')">0:53:13</a> until the bottom of the time of  
<a onclick="modifyYTiframeseektime('3195')">0:53:15</a> hamburger so you cannot blame him that  
<a onclick="modifyYTiframeseektime('3196')">0:53:16</a> that he is no no he is at the end of a  
<a onclick="modifyYTiframeseektime('3200')">0:53:20</a> declining period after a stagnation and  
<a onclick="modifyYTiframeseektime('3202')">0:53:22</a> after the development of scholarship  
<a onclick="modifyYTiframeseektime('3203')">0:53:23</a> which was starting to become deviant  
<a onclick="modifyYTiframeseektime('3205')">0:53:25</a> after the time of sahaba anyway  
<a onclick="modifyYTiframeseektime('3208')">0:53:28</a> so you cannot believe me but that's a  
<a onclick="modifyYTiframeseektime('3209')">0:53:29</a> reality  
<a onclick="modifyYTiframeseektime('3210')">0:53:30</a> his osun the way he looks at Quran Sun  
<a onclick="modifyYTiframeseektime('3213')">0:53:33</a> the way he reads it is with half-blind  
<a onclick="modifyYTiframeseektime('3216')">0:53:36</a> eyes  
<a onclick="modifyYTiframeseektime('3218')">0:53:38</a> so that's the reason the book of the  
<a onclick="modifyYTiframeseektime('3219')">0:53:39</a> head we have these three first chapters  
<a onclick="modifyYTiframeseektime('3221')">0:53:41</a> try to clarify that for example  
<a onclick="modifyYTiframeseektime('3223')">0:53:43</a> principle going to the bottom of the  
<a onclick="modifyYTiframeseektime('3225')">0:53:45</a> absolute necessities of of of of uh of  
<a onclick="modifyYTiframeseektime('3230')">0:53:50</a> reason and perception and also the  
<a onclick="modifyYTiframeseektime('3232')">0:53:52</a> necessity of the Quran only that most  
<a onclick="modifyYTiframeseektime('3234')">0:53:54</a> fundamental and pressing Necessities are  
<a onclick="modifyYTiframeseektime('3237')">0:53:57</a> directed there then we discuss later  
<a onclick="modifyYTiframeseektime('3239')">0:53:59</a> than the evidences of prophet told us on  
<a onclick="modifyYTiframeseektime('3241')">0:54:01</a> and then about the issues of and  
<a onclick="modifyYTiframeseektime('3244')">0:54:04</a> worshiping grievance on so the other  
<a onclick="modifyYTiframeseektime('3247')">0:54:07</a> thing that they kind of  
<a onclick="modifyYTiframeseektime('3248')">0:54:08</a> um hang their Appeal on is the issue of  
<a onclick="modifyYTiframeseektime('3252')">0:54:12</a> better and  
<a onclick="modifyYTiframeseektime('3256')">0:54:16</a> this entire insistence of having purity  
<a onclick="modifyYTiframeseektime('3259')">0:54:19</a> of Dean so this Creed okay and then  
<a onclick="modifyYTiframeseektime('3262')">0:54:22</a> there's the acts themselves  
<a onclick="modifyYTiframeseektime('3264')">0:54:24</a> almost because because  
<a onclick="modifyYTiframeseektime('3272')">0:54:32</a> this is the reason it's believing that  
<a onclick="modifyYTiframeseektime('3274')">0:54:34</a> Allah has messenger  
<a onclick="modifyYTiframeseektime('3277')">0:54:37</a> Etc even that it is  
<a onclick="modifyYTiframeseektime('3284')">0:54:44</a> essential that's it but all the details  
<a onclick="modifyYTiframeseektime('3286')">0:54:46</a> there are many Hadith about details of

<a onclick="modifyYTiframeseektime('3304')">0:55:04</a> these secondary questions about is the

<a onclick="modifyYTiframeseektime('3311')">0:55:11</a> declare Akita and put it as a part of to  
<a onclick="modifyYTiframeseektime('3314')">0:55:14</a> read and play a game with that to the  
<a onclick="modifyYTiframeseektime('3315')">0:55:15</a> people that have a cool their mind you  
<a onclick="modifyYTiframeseektime('3317')">0:55:17</a> have become an issue when did this  
<a onclick="modifyYTiframeseektime('3318')">0:55:18</a> become an issue and how do they are how  
<a onclick="modifyYTiframeseektime('3320')">0:55:20</a> how would you rebuttal that the the  
<a onclick="modifyYTiframeseektime('3322')">0:55:22</a> articulation that is is an issue and  
<a onclick="modifyYTiframeseektime('3324')">0:55:24</a> it's because it's related to create  
<a onclick="modifyYTiframeseektime('3325')">0:55:25</a> because because clearly it was not the  
<a onclick="modifyYTiframeseektime('3327')">0:55:27</a> issue of the time that they claimed the  
<a onclick="modifyYTiframeseektime('3328')">0:55:28</a> sale of sahaba they never discussed that  
<a onclick="modifyYTiframeseektime('3331')">0:55:31</a> because they understood that everyone  
<a onclick="modifyYTiframeseektime('3333')">0:55:33</a> understood his own way as a Canal's  
<a onclick="modifyYTiframeseektime('3336')">0:55:36</a> imagination and they understood that  
<a onclick="modifyYTiframeseektime('3338')">0:55:38</a> they understood the general principle  
<a onclick="modifyYTiframeseektime('3339')">0:55:39</a> that Allah is different than what if I  
<a onclick="modifyYTiframeseektime('3340')">0:55:40</a> imagine but whatever imagine is okay  
<a onclick="modifyYTiframeseektime('3342')">0:55:42</a> according to our limited human  
<a onclick="modifyYTiframeseektime('3344')">0:55:44</a> perception full stop stay there that's  
<a onclick="modifyYTiframeseektime('3346')">0:55:46</a> it they didn't need they didn't have any  
<a onclick="modifyYTiframeseektime('3348')">0:55:48</a> need to discuss and go in this issue  
<a onclick="modifyYTiframeseektime('3351')">0:55:51</a> barely there may be 102 issues related  
<a onclick="modifyYTiframeseektime('3354')">0:55:54</a> to what is the course one or two  
<a onclick="modifyYTiframeseektime('3357')">0:55:57</a> narrations that's all that is there  
<a onclick="modifyYTiframeseektime('3360')">0:56:00</a> that's it and nothing else about that  
<a onclick="modifyYTiframeseektime('3363')">0:56:03</a> they were disputes about who is Muslim  
<a onclick="modifyYTiframeseektime('3365')">0:56:05</a> on the cover and what gets you are the  
<a onclick="modifyYTiframeseektime('3366')">0:56:06</a> problem of Islam when the time of sahaba  
<a onclick="modifyYTiframeseektime('3368')">0:56:08</a> by the qawal that would dispute that's  
<a onclick="modifyYTiframeseektime('3370')">0:56:10</a> the beginning but not least what they  
<a onclick="modifyYTiframeseektime('3372')">0:56:12</a> call it  
<a onclick="modifyYTiframeseektime('3373')">0:56:13</a> but they usually call it rapidly  
<a onclick="modifyYTiframeseektime('3375')">0:56:15</a> especially their own Akita which is the  
<a onclick="modifyYTiframeseektime('3377')">0:56:17</a> defining the Divinity in a in a  
<a onclick="modifyYTiframeseektime('3380')">0:56:20</a> definition which control  
<a onclick="modifyYTiframeseektime('3388')">0:56:28</a> so that's that that's it  
<a onclick="modifyYTiframeseektime('3389')">0:56:29</a> that's part of the problem so for  
<a onclick="modifyYTiframeseektime('3391')">0:56:31</a> example take the issue this is more  
<a onclick="modifyYTiframeseektime('3395')">0:56:35</a> important than Sharia you have to have  
<a onclick="modifyYTiframeseektime('3397')">0:56:37</a> the correct Creed  
<a onclick="modifyYTiframeseektime('3398')">0:56:38</a> and the view will confuse Creed with  
<a onclick="modifyYTiframeseektime('3400')">0:56:40</a> Iman all this mixed up becomes then a  
<a onclick="modifyYTiframeseektime('3403')">0:56:43</a> major issue pushes not matter it's not  
<a onclick="modifyYTiframeseektime('3406')">0:56:46</a> even secondary  
<a onclick="modifyYTiframeseektime('3407')">0:56:47</a> okay so so the issue that they make they  
<a onclick="modifyYTiframeseektime('3410')">0:56:50</a> fixate on life example the hand the  
<a onclick="modifyYTiframeseektime('3412')">0:56:52</a> Cursi there's no requirement at all to  
<a onclick="modifyYTiframeseektime('3414')">0:56:54</a> to extrapolate that or to have an  
<a onclick="modifyYTiframeseektime('3416')">0:56:56</a> adoption on that absolutely no  
<a onclick="modifyYTiframeseektime('3417')">0:56:57</a> requirements that's cleared another  
<a onclick="modifyYTiframeseektime('3418')">0:56:58</a> equipment  
<a onclick="modifyYTiframeseektime('3421')">0:57:01</a> when they use the word  
<a onclick="modifyYTiframeseektime('3423')">0:57:03</a> is it usually they they use it on the  
<a onclick="modifyYTiframeseektime('3426')">0:57:06</a> issue of creed and they also use it in  
<a onclick="modifyYTiframeseektime('3427')">0:57:07</a> related to actions so for example  
<a onclick="modifyYTiframeseektime('3429')">0:57:09</a> Millard birthday of the Prophet various  
<a onclick="modifyYTiframeseektime('3433')">0:57:13</a> things again on a fundamentally that  
<a onclick="modifyYTiframeseektime('3436')">0:57:16</a> what whatever this Harbor did not do we  
<a onclick="modifyYTiframeseektime('3439')">0:57:19</a> should not do which is completely even  
<a onclick="modifyYTiframeseektime('3442')">0:57:22</a> whatever the prophet did not do we  
<a onclick="modifyYTiframeseektime('3443')">0:57:23</a> should not do because we're not doing is  
<a onclick="modifyYTiframeseektime('3446')">0:57:26</a> nothing nothing comes with evidence for  
<a onclick="modifyYTiframeseektime('3447')">0:57:27</a> anything nothing is is a fundamental  
<a onclick="modifyYTiframeseektime('3450')">0:57:30</a> logical flow  
<a onclick="modifyYTiframeseektime('3453')">0:57:33</a> so I can understand for example actions  
<a onclick="modifyYTiframeseektime('3456')">0:57:36</a> results  
<a onclick="modifyYTiframeseektime('3458')">0:57:38</a> action and leave it the only you think  
<a onclick="modifyYTiframeseektime('3461')">0:57:41</a> you can conclude that by the necessary  
<a onclick="modifyYTiframeseektime('3463')">0:57:43</a> visa and by the old overwhelming  
<a onclick="modifyYTiframeseektime('3465')">0:57:45</a> narration is that that what he has left  
<a onclick="modifyYTiframeseektime('3467')">0:57:47</a> cannot be cannot have been obligatory  
<a onclick="modifyYTiframeseektime('3469')">0:57:49</a> that's all of it it may be still  
<a onclick="modifyYTiframeseektime('3471')">0:57:51</a> desirable lifted deliberately  
<a onclick="modifyYTiframeseektime('3474')">0:57:54</a> did the deliberately leave it to uh to  
<a onclick="modifyYTiframeseektime('3479')">0:57:59</a> show that it's not obligatory it could  
<a onclick="modifyYTiframeseektime('3480')">0:58:00</a> be desirable it could be play mobile it  
<a onclick="modifyYTiframeseektime('3484')">0:58:04</a> could be undesirable it could be Haram  
<a onclick="modifyYTiframeseektime('3485')">0:58:05</a> all these four you have to have extra  
<a onclick="modifyYTiframeseektime('3487')">0:58:07</a> evidence for that  
<a onclick="modifyYTiframeseektime('3489')">0:58:09</a> that's if he has done an act and left it  
<a onclick="modifyYTiframeseektime('3492')">0:58:12</a> if he has done no act at all like for  
<a onclick="modifyYTiframeseektime('3494')">0:58:14</a> example  
<a onclick="modifyYTiframeseektime('3495')">0:58:15</a> he enabled he never uh  
<a onclick="modifyYTiframeseektime('3500')">0:58:20</a> planned or or tried to to to to build  
<a onclick="modifyYTiframeseektime('3503')">0:58:23</a> the rocket to go to the Moon  
<a onclick="modifyYTiframeseektime('3506')">0:58:26</a> because it it was not given at his time  
<a onclick="modifyYTiframeseektime('3510')">0:58:30</a> can you conclude that building located  
<a onclick="modifyYTiframeseektime('3518')">0:58:38</a> would you apply it to such odd cases in  
<a onclick="modifyYTiframeseektime('3521')">0:58:41</a> normal cases they can play they say he  
<a onclick="modifyYTiframeseektime('3523')">0:58:43</a> did not celebrate his his birthday  
<a onclick="modifyYTiframeseektime('3526')">0:58:46</a> the only thing you can say for that yeah  
<a onclick="modifyYTiframeseektime('3528')">0:58:48</a> it's not obligatory  
<a onclick="modifyYTiframeseektime('3530')">0:58:50</a> that's all  
<a onclick="modifyYTiframeseektime('3532')">0:58:52</a> but if they frame certain things as  
<a onclick="modifyYTiframeseektime('3534')">0:58:54</a> being but in fact he prayed the one day  
<a onclick="modifyYTiframeseektime('3536')">0:58:56</a> as you say this is about Monday fasting  
<a onclick="modifyYTiframeseektime('3538')">0:58:58</a> Monday because this is my birthday  
<a onclick="modifyYTiframeseektime('3540')">0:59:00</a> that's the day I'm born so in things  
<a onclick="modifyYTiframeseektime('3542')">0:59:02</a> that the day is born is a nice day worth  
<a onclick="modifyYTiframeseektime('3544')">0:59:04</a> of celebrating by fasting or whatever  
<a onclick="modifyYTiframeseektime('3545')">0:59:05</a> celebration ending but he did not do  
<a onclick="modifyYTiframeseektime('3548')">0:59:08</a> and also the Arab tradition in the other  
<a onclick="modifyYTiframeseektime('3550')">0:59:10</a> position there was no celebrating your  
<a onclick="modifyYTiframeseektime('3552')">0:59:12</a> birthdays while other nations celebrate  
<a onclick="modifyYTiframeseektime('3554')">0:59:14</a> birthdays  
<a onclick="modifyYTiframeseektime('3556')">0:59:16</a> so showing that SSA is a assembly  
<a onclick="modifyYTiframeseektime('3560')">0:59:20</a> assembly uh you cannot conclude from  
<a onclick="modifyYTiframeseektime('3563')">0:59:23</a> that you have to have other desert  
<a onclick="modifyYTiframeseektime('3564')">0:59:24</a> someone could say based on that he  
<a onclick="modifyYTiframeseektime('3566')">0:59:26</a> present Monday passing on Monday because  
<a onclick="modifyYTiframeseektime('3568')">0:59:28</a> he said Monday is the day I am born on  
<a onclick="modifyYTiframeseektime('3570')">0:59:30</a> the meaning Monday is a good day we're  
<a onclick="modifyYTiframeseektime('3574')">0:59:34</a> celebrating with Siam but his birthday  
<a onclick="modifyYTiframeseektime('3576')">0:59:36</a> is also worth celebrating because he  
<a onclick="modifyYTiframeseektime('3578')">0:59:38</a> made that a good feature of Monday  
<a onclick="modifyYTiframeseektime('3582')">0:59:42</a> so you may conclude from that that is  
<a onclick="modifyYTiframeseektime('3583')">0:59:43</a> maybe desirable disability of his  
<a onclick="modifyYTiframeseektime('3585')">0:59:45</a> birthday even if he doesn't maybe he did  
<a onclick="modifyYTiframeseektime('3587')">0:59:47</a> not get celebrated so that it doesn't  
<a onclick="modifyYTiframeseektime('3589')">0:59:49</a> break it came an injunction and burden  
<a onclick="modifyYTiframeseektime('3591')">0:59:51</a> to his ummah then they go through the  
<a onclick="modifyYTiframeseektime('3593')">0:59:53</a> excessive exactly like the case with the  
<a onclick="modifyYTiframeseektime('3595')">0:59:55</a> discussion going around between some  
<a onclick="modifyYTiframeseektime('3597')">0:59:57</a> Sunni and Shia  
<a onclick="modifyYTiframeseektime('3599')">0:59:59</a> Etc or some Shia and Sunni  
<a onclick="modifyYTiframeseektime('3602')">1:00:02</a> as a matter of fact he started Torah we  
<a onclick="modifyYTiframeseektime('3604')">1:00:04</a> had started even the Masjid  
<a onclick="modifyYTiframeseektime('3606')">1:00:06</a> and then more people came more people  
<a onclick="modifyYTiframeseektime('3608')">1:00:08</a> came then he decided it's becoming  
<a onclick="modifyYTiframeseektime('3610')">1:00:10</a> dangerous now so he stayed home  
<a onclick="modifyYTiframeseektime('3612')">1:00:12</a> and they came with it I started Wiki  
<a onclick="modifyYTiframeseektime('3616')">1:00:16</a> sound that we are here ignored them at  
<a onclick="modifyYTiframeseektime('3619')">1:00:19</a> the end and the last day they thought  
<a onclick="modifyYTiframeseektime('3622')">1:00:22</a> even Stone against his daughter was very  
<a onclick="modifyYTiframeseektime('3624')">1:00:24</a> angry  
<a onclick="modifyYTiframeseektime('3625')">1:00:25</a> and he said you all must have caused  
<a onclick="modifyYTiframeseektime('3627')">1:00:27</a> Allah to make obligatory on you I  
<a onclick="modifyYTiframeseektime('3630')">1:00:30</a> abstained from doing it so it doesn't  
<a onclick="modifyYTiframeseektime('3633')">1:00:33</a> may become obligatory  
<a onclick="modifyYTiframeseektime('3635')">1:00:35</a> when the best player besides after  
<a onclick="modifyYTiframeseektime('3637')">1:00:37</a> fariba is the one the one who you pray  
<a onclick="modifyYTiframeseektime('3640')">1:00:40</a> at home  
<a onclick="modifyYTiframeseektime('3642')">1:00:42</a> you see the point and then people said  
<a onclick="modifyYTiframeseektime('3644')">1:00:44</a> after that because of that some people  
<a onclick="modifyYTiframeseektime('3645')">1:00:45</a> she has it it's a bit of almost no it's  
<a onclick="modifyYTiframeseektime('3648')">1:00:48</a> not Buddha because after the part passed  
<a onclick="modifyYTiframeseektime('3651')">1:00:51</a> away there is no danger of to become  
<a onclick="modifyYTiframeseektime('3652')">1:00:52</a> obligated  
<a onclick="modifyYTiframeseektime('3654')">1:00:54</a> now we can do the nice thing and bring  
<a onclick="modifyYTiframeseektime('3657')">1:00:57</a> the people and have an Imam who is good  
<a onclick="modifyYTiframeseektime('3659')">1:00:59</a> in with a good voice and eating and even  
<a onclick="modifyYTiframeseektime('3661')">1:01:01</a> having an Imam for men and a man for  
<a onclick="modifyYTiframeseektime('3663')">1:01:03</a> woman because the Masjid was very big  
<a onclick="modifyYTiframeseektime('3665')">1:01:05</a> and they couldn't hear them but they  
<a onclick="modifyYTiframeseektime('3666')">1:01:06</a> didn't have microphones at that time or  
<a onclick="modifyYTiframeseektime('3668')">1:01:08</a> megaphones so I said so his problem was  
<a onclick="modifyYTiframeseektime('3670')">1:01:10</a> not better it's a very good act  
<a onclick="modifyYTiframeseektime('3673')">1:01:13</a> as a very good act  
<a onclick="modifyYTiframeseektime('3675')">1:01:15</a> just to give you an example but the  
<a onclick="modifyYTiframeseektime('3678')">1:01:18</a> problem is the Also let's go to the  
<a onclick="modifyYTiframeseektime('3679')">1:01:19</a> fundamental soul  
<a onclick="modifyYTiframeseektime('3682')">1:01:22</a> that he did not do something or even  
<a onclick="modifyYTiframeseektime('3684')">1:01:24</a> left something after doing  
<a onclick="modifyYTiframeseektime('3686')">1:01:26</a> in the case of tarawi has very clearly  
<a onclick="modifyYTiframeseektime('3688')">1:01:28</a> breaking through in Jamaica in the  
<a onclick="modifyYTiframeseektime('3690')">1:01:30</a> Masjid  
<a onclick="modifyYTiframeseektime('3691')">1:01:31</a> is because he was concerned that it may

<a onclick="modifyYTiframeseektime('3696')">1:01:36</a> and the junction May Come From Heaven

<a onclick="modifyYTiframeseektime('3789')">1:03:09</a> basically uh ruling of permissibility  
<a onclick="modifyYTiframeseektime('3796')">1:03:16</a> the basic learning of action thoughts  
<a onclick="modifyYTiframeseektime('3799')">1:03:19</a> and everything is permissibility  
<a onclick="modifyYTiframeseektime('3804')">1:03:24</a> for example some Scholars I don't know  
<a onclick="modifyYTiframeseektime('3806')">1:03:26</a> the names would argue that if you  
<a onclick="modifyYTiframeseektime('3808')">1:03:28</a> repeated a certain act and you  
<a onclick="modifyYTiframeseektime('3811')">1:03:31</a> incorporate into your your your worship  
<a onclick="modifyYTiframeseektime('3813')">1:03:33</a> and you consider it to be recommended or  
<a onclick="modifyYTiframeseektime('3815')">1:03:35</a> something of that nature that makes it  
<a onclick="modifyYTiframeseektime('3817')">1:03:37</a> into a bidder  
<a onclick="modifyYTiframeseektime('3818')">1:03:38</a> if you if you make it recommended  
<a onclick="modifyYTiframeseektime('3820')">1:03:40</a> without any evidence  
<a onclick="modifyYTiframeseektime('3827')">1:03:47</a> like for example you you you can very  
<a onclick="modifyYTiframeseektime('3830')">1:03:50</a> well celebrate at the moment of the  
<a onclick="modifyYTiframeseektime('3831')">1:03:51</a> neighborhood yes it's certain Arabic  
<a onclick="modifyYTiframeseektime('3833')">1:03:53</a> tradition he did not say about it  
<a onclick="modifyYTiframeseektime('3835')">1:03:55</a> celebrated for whatever reason so it's  
<a onclick="modifyYTiframeseektime('3837')">1:03:57</a> definitely not obligatory but he Praises  
<a onclick="modifyYTiframeseektime('3839')">1:03:59</a> Monday being said that's the day I am  
<a onclick="modifyYTiframeseektime('3841')">1:04:01</a> born in meaning is a blessed day if the  
<a onclick="modifyYTiframeseektime('3845')">1:04:05</a> Monday is blessed in the week then the  
<a onclick="modifyYTiframeseektime('3847')">1:04:07</a> day he is born  
<a onclick="modifyYTiframeseektime('3848')">1:04:08</a> or supposed to be born because the day  
<a onclick="modifyYTiframeseektime('3850')">1:04:10</a> the people that live now is almost  
<a onclick="modifyYTiframeseektime('3852')">1:04:12</a> certainly the wrong there I have some  
<a onclick="modifyYTiframeseektime('3854')">1:04:14</a> work for that but that's not our issue  
<a onclick="modifyYTiframeseektime('3855')">1:04:15</a> today  
<a onclick="modifyYTiframeseektime('3856')">1:04:16</a> is almost certainly the wrong day  
<a onclick="modifyYTiframeseektime('3859')">1:04:19</a> but still  
<a onclick="modifyYTiframeseektime('3861')">1:04:21</a> they assume it is being the day and they  
<a onclick="modifyYTiframeseektime('3864')">1:04:24</a> celebrated as an occasion  
<a onclick="modifyYTiframeseektime('3867')">1:04:27</a> I say the first place that had regarded  
<a onclick="modifyYTiframeseektime('3869')">1:04:29</a> as a blessed day you can celebrate  
<a onclick="modifyYTiframeseektime('3873')">1:04:33</a> so as long as it's framed in the road  
<a onclick="modifyYTiframeseektime('3875')">1:04:35</a> because you have an argument the other  
<a onclick="modifyYTiframeseektime('3877')">1:04:37</a> one is purely  
<a onclick="modifyYTiframeseektime('3880')">1:04:40</a> making a uh with absolutely no evidence  
<a onclick="modifyYTiframeseektime('3883')">1:04:43</a> like for example taking that profit  
<a onclick="modifyYTiframeseektime('3886')">1:04:46</a> usually may God offer every Salah will  
<a onclick="modifyYTiframeseektime('3888')">1:04:48</a> she showed that is not obligated you see  
<a onclick="modifyYTiframeseektime('3890')">1:04:50</a> but it is even better and more desirable  
<a onclick="modifyYTiframeseektime('3892')">1:04:52</a> and closer to Allah foreign  
<a onclick="modifyYTiframeseektime('3898')">1:04:58</a> not even one hint  
<a onclick="modifyYTiframeseektime('3903')">1:05:03</a> you see my point that's it that's Rida  
<a onclick="modifyYTiframeseektime('3906')">1:05:06</a> but the other one is not better because  
<a onclick="modifyYTiframeseektime('3908')">1:05:08</a> the possible point of view and the  
<a onclick="modifyYTiframeseektime('3909')">1:05:09</a> argument is actually structural and well  
<a onclick="modifyYTiframeseektime('3911')">1:05:11</a> well established it's a good argument  
<a onclick="modifyYTiframeseektime('3914')">1:05:14</a> did not do it it's not that partition  
<a onclick="modifyYTiframeseektime('3918')">1:05:18</a> they were busy with Jihad did not come  
<a onclick="modifyYTiframeseektime('3920')">1:05:20</a> in their mind keep in mind with the  
<a onclick="modifyYTiframeseektime('3922')">1:05:22</a> people later  
<a onclick="modifyYTiframeseektime('3923')">1:05:23</a> so this recession about Buddha is being  
<a onclick="modifyYTiframeseektime('3925')">1:05:25</a> well firstly framing something is bitter  
<a onclick="modifyYTiframeseektime('3928')">1:05:28</a> and then making it such an overwhelming  
<a onclick="modifyYTiframeseektime('3930')">1:05:30</a> issue  
<a onclick="modifyYTiframeseektime('3932')">1:05:32</a> which almost you know overrides shedding  
<a onclick="modifyYTiframeseektime('3935')">1:05:35</a> blood this is this indicate a mentality  
<a onclick="modifyYTiframeseektime('3939')">1:05:39</a> which is going extremely religions which  
<a onclick="modifyYTiframeseektime('3941')">1:05:41</a> is very destructive  
<a onclick="modifyYTiframeseektime('3942')">1:05:42</a> prohibited that and then occasion which  
<a onclick="modifyYTiframeseektime('3945')">1:05:45</a> is shocking you know the story now let  
<a onclick="modifyYTiframeseektime('3947')">1:05:47</a> me repeat the story in his in his final  
<a onclick="modifyYTiframeseektime('3949')">1:05:49</a> uh uh pilgrimage just few months before  
<a onclick="modifyYTiframeseektime('3952')">1:05:52</a> he died  
<a onclick="modifyYTiframeseektime('3958')">1:05:58</a> and also another I think uh  
<a onclick="modifyYTiframeseektime('3963')">1:06:03</a> they were mounting behind the prophet in  
<a onclick="modifyYTiframeseektime('3965')">1:06:05</a> exchange sometimes they alphabet  
<a onclick="modifyYTiframeseektime('3967')">1:06:07</a> sometimes they'll have battle so taking  
<a onclick="modifyYTiframeseektime('3969')">1:06:09</a> that it was my turn when it arrived in  
<a onclick="modifyYTiframeseektime('3972')">1:06:12</a> in Muslim  
<a onclick="modifyYTiframeseektime('3975')">1:06:15</a> and then we set down you know it was  
<a onclick="modifyYTiframeseektime('3977')">1:06:17</a> there before you set down because they  
<a onclick="modifyYTiframeseektime('3978')">1:06:18</a> depart on camel back and then coming  
<a onclick="modifyYTiframeseektime('3980')">1:06:20</a> back you don't have a traffic jam  
<a onclick="modifyYTiframeseektime('3982')">1:06:22</a> because Cummins was killed to go up with  
<a onclick="modifyYTiframeseektime('3983')">1:06:23</a> the warranty and so on and the number  
<a onclick="modifyYTiframeseektime('3985')">1:06:25</a> was also limited that time nowadays if  
<a onclick="modifyYTiframeseektime('3987')">1:06:27</a> you depart with cars we get stuck you  
<a onclick="modifyYTiframeseektime('3990')">1:06:30</a> are happy tradition was dead from Before  
<a onclick="modifyYTiframeseektime('3991')">1:06:31</a> Dawn I will not get any opportunities to  
<a onclick="modifyYTiframeseektime('3994')">1:06:34</a> happen but at the time they went so we  
<a onclick="modifyYTiframeseektime('3996')">1:06:36</a> settled there  
<a onclick="modifyYTiframeseektime('3998')">1:06:38</a> and before going to sleep I think I've  
<a onclick="modifyYTiframeseektime('4001')">1:06:41</a> been working that project I think we'll  
<a onclick="modifyYTiframeseektime('4002')">1:06:42</a> go to sleep as a precaution if not even  
<a onclick="modifyYTiframeseektime('4004')">1:06:44</a> us select for me uh Stones so on so much  
<a onclick="modifyYTiframeseektime('4008')">1:06:48</a> most likely for every day it's like  
<a onclick="modifyYTiframeseektime('4010')">1:06:50</a> almost daily from the stones that is  
<a onclick="modifyYTiframeseektime('4012')">1:06:52</a> more than nice  
<a onclick="modifyYTiframeseektime('4016')">1:06:56</a> but in that place  
<a onclick="modifyYTiframeseektime('4018')">1:06:58</a> I selected small stones which are like  
<a onclick="modifyYTiframeseektime('4021')">1:07:01</a> the size of chickpeas  
<a onclick="modifyYTiframeseektime('4024')">1:07:04</a> very small  
<a onclick="modifyYTiframeseektime('4026')">1:07:06</a> and they put in his hand he was amazed  
<a onclick="modifyYTiframeseektime('4028')">1:07:08</a> about  
<a onclick="modifyYTiframeseektime('4029')">1:07:09</a> while  
<a onclick="modifyYTiframeseektime('4031')">1:07:11</a> this is maybe the right to the right  
<a onclick="modifyYTiframeseektime('4034')">1:07:14</a> size for nice management and putting a  
<a onclick="modifyYTiframeseektime('4036')">1:07:16</a> big number in a bag I think it's a baby  
<a onclick="modifyYTiframeseektime('4038')">1:07:18</a> that's right okay  
<a onclick="modifyYTiframeseektime('4039')">1:07:19</a> and the people around him also visit we  
<a onclick="modifyYTiframeseektime('4042')">1:07:22</a> were around him continuously to learn  
<a onclick="modifyYTiframeseektime('4044')">1:07:24</a> from him to get advice to get  
<a onclick="modifyYTiframeseektime('4045')">1:07:25</a> instructions to get guidance  
<a onclick="modifyYTiframeseektime('4048')">1:07:28</a> on the filters maybe the last pilgrimage  
<a onclick="modifyYTiframeseektime('4050')">1:07:30</a> so they have to get opportunity to soak  
<a onclick="modifyYTiframeseektime('4053')">1:07:33</a> as much as possible from the knowledge  
<a onclick="modifyYTiframeseektime('4054')">1:07:34</a> coming from Heaven through him  
<a onclick="modifyYTiframeseektime('4058')">1:07:38</a> and then to the people say  
<a onclick="modifyYTiframeseektime('4060')">1:07:40</a> like with this size  
<a onclick="modifyYTiframeseektime('4063')">1:07:43</a> dostoning and then he make a statement  
<a onclick="modifyYTiframeseektime('4066')">1:07:46</a> which seems to be shocking seems we are  
<a onclick="modifyYTiframeseektime('4067')">1:07:47</a> related to this small Silverstone  
<a onclick="modifyYTiframeseektime('4071')">1:07:51</a> don't go extreme in devotion indeed din  
<a onclick="modifyYTiframeseektime('4075')">1:07:55</a> here means the dayun being devoted being  
<a onclick="modifyYTiframeseektime('4077')">1:07:57</a> religious don't call Extreme because the  
<a onclick="modifyYTiframeseektime('4080')">1:08:00</a> previous nations were destroyed by going  
<a onclick="modifyYTiframeseektime('4082')">1:08:02</a> this extreme empty  
<a onclick="modifyYTiframeseektime('4085')">1:08:05</a> because you may think I am going to  
<a onclick="modifyYTiframeseektime('4087')">1:08:07</a> Stone the devil  
<a onclick="modifyYTiframeseektime('4089')">1:08:09</a> I think I saw Stone so so is hostility  
<a onclick="modifyYTiframeseektime('4093')">1:08:13</a> and hated more  
<a onclick="modifyYTiframeseektime('4094')">1:08:14</a> um take a big Stone and the next time  
<a onclick="modifyYTiframeseektime('4097')">1:08:17</a> you take a bigger Stone  
<a onclick="modifyYTiframeseektime('4099')">1:08:19</a> and the next time to recover the machine  
<a onclick="modifyYTiframeseektime('4101')">1:08:21</a> gun and then you kill the people think  
<a onclick="modifyYTiframeseektime('4102')">1:08:22</a> about that's not what develops that's  
<a onclick="modifyYTiframeseektime('4104')">1:08:24</a> all of the game would lead to your  
<a onclick="modifyYTiframeseektime('4106')">1:08:26</a> destruction  
<a onclick="modifyYTiframeseektime('4109')">1:08:29</a> couldn't you have a counter argument in  
<a onclick="modifyYTiframeseektime('4111')">1:08:31</a> the sense that is the fact that people  
<a onclick="modifyYTiframeseektime('4113')">1:08:33</a> incorporate other rituals  
<a onclick="modifyYTiframeseektime('4116')">1:08:36</a> is what's leading to Hulu so for example  
<a onclick="modifyYTiframeseektime('4118')">1:08:38</a> no no no the argument is faulted  
<a onclick="modifyYTiframeseektime('4124')">1:08:44</a> now now you show if they come with that  
<a onclick="modifyYTiframeseektime('4127')">1:08:47</a> argument say we have this Hadith showing  
<a onclick="modifyYTiframeseektime('4130')">1:08:50</a> he's saying clearly had a farm with this  
<a onclick="modifyYTiframeseektime('4133')">1:08:53</a> size  
<a onclick="modifyYTiframeseektime('4137')">1:08:57</a> and avoid and a Saturday avoid going  
<a onclick="modifyYTiframeseektime('4139')">1:08:59</a> extremism indeed  
<a onclick="modifyYTiframeseektime('4141')">1:09:01</a> because the previous things were  
<a onclick="modifyYTiframeseektime('4143')">1:09:03</a> destroyed  
<a onclick="modifyYTiframeseektime('4144')">1:09:04</a> and the only occasion he said previously  
<a onclick="modifyYTiframeseektime('4146')">1:09:06</a> will destroy it is this one and another  
<a onclick="modifyYTiframeseektime('4148')">1:09:08</a> one that they they punished the the poor  
<a onclick="modifyYTiframeseektime('4150')">1:09:10</a> and the lowly and leave the rich and the  
<a onclick="modifyYTiframeseektime('4153')">1:09:13</a> noble from punishment  
<a onclick="modifyYTiframeseektime('4155')">1:09:15</a> and the equation of cutting the hand of  
<a onclick="modifyYTiframeseektime('4157')">1:09:17</a> the Jose Jose  
<a onclick="modifyYTiframeseektime('4159')">1:09:19</a> and he said even if Fatima committed  
<a onclick="modifyYTiframeseektime('4163')">1:09:23</a> and another two other occasions of what  
<a onclick="modifyYTiframeseektime('4166')">1:09:26</a> we destroy another one is that they were  
<a onclick="modifyYTiframeseektime('4168')">1:09:28</a> asking to their messenger and going back  
<a onclick="modifyYTiframeseektime('4170')">1:09:30</a> and forth with questions and  
<a onclick="modifyYTiframeseektime('4171')">1:09:31</a> interrogations so they missing you that  
<a onclick="modifyYTiframeseektime('4173')">1:09:33</a> destroys Nations  
<a onclick="modifyYTiframeseektime('4174')">1:09:34</a> Etc then four or five you can you can't  
<a onclick="modifyYTiframeseektime('4176')">1:09:36</a> even you can't even search in in any  
<a onclick="modifyYTiframeseektime('4179')">1:09:39</a> collection of Hadith and so on with the  
<a onclick="modifyYTiframeseektime('4181')">1:09:41</a> word  
<a onclick="modifyYTiframeseektime('4183')">1:09:43</a> then you will find four or five types  
<a onclick="modifyYTiframeseektime('4186')">1:09:46</a> that's one of them and the example given  
<a onclick="modifyYTiframeseektime('4188')">1:09:48</a> is clear it's not increment in English  
<a onclick="modifyYTiframeseektime('4190')">1:09:50</a> but it's exaggerating the size of the  
<a onclick="modifyYTiframeseektime('4192')">1:09:52</a> Stone

<a onclick="modifyYTiframeseektime('4207')">1:10:07</a> they're very hot devoted and so on  
<a onclick="modifyYTiframeseektime('4210')">1:10:10</a> at the astonic site some of them take  
<a onclick="modifyYTiframeseektime('4213')">1:10:13</a> their shoes and throat at the Devil  
<a onclick="modifyYTiframeseektime('4214')">1:10:14</a> you'll cause me to divorce my wife  
<a onclick="modifyYTiframeseektime('4217')">1:10:17</a> and just you need to mess with the shoe

<a onclick="modifyYTiframeseektime('4220')">1:10:20</a> you are lucky if you don't plug his eye  
<a onclick="modifyYTiframeseektime('4222')">1:10:22</a> out  
<a onclick="modifyYTiframeseektime('4225')">1:10:25</a> and if it comes a general habit or  
<a onclick="modifyYTiframeseektime('4226')">1:10:26</a> integrating everything  
<a onclick="modifyYTiframeseektime('4228')">1:10:28</a> between to destruction  
<a onclick="modifyYTiframeseektime('4232')">1:10:32</a> ultimately it's that simple but it will  
<a onclick="modifyYTiframeseektime('4235')">1:10:35</a> grow because the mentality the obsessed  
<a onclick="modifyYTiframeseektime('4237')">1:10:37</a> mentality that's a small pious  
<a onclick="modifyYTiframeseektime('4240')">1:10:40</a> so in some in some ways this whole and  
<a onclick="modifyYTiframeseektime('4243')">1:10:43</a> so a good parallel for this one another  
<a onclick="modifyYTiframeseektime('4245')">1:10:45</a> example there is an example of that one  
<a onclick="modifyYTiframeseektime('4248')">1:10:48</a> time in a battle campaign the part of  
<a onclick="modifyYTiframeseektime('4249')">1:10:49</a> those fasting usually he doesn't faster

<a onclick="modifyYTiframeseektime('4253')">1:10:53</a> in a comment and then the sun just sank  
<a onclick="modifyYTiframeseektime('4255')">1:10:55</a> just barely suck and the Horizon is  
<a onclick="modifyYTiframeseektime('4258')">1:10:58</a> burning  
<a onclick="modifyYTiframeseektime('4259')">1:10:59</a> with light  
<a onclick="modifyYTiframeseektime('4260')">1:11:00</a> and you say to the one driving the camel  
<a onclick="modifyYTiframeseektime('4263')">1:11:03</a> stop and let us go down and do us for a  
<a onclick="modifyYTiframeseektime('4265')">1:11:05</a> drink  
<a onclick="modifyYTiframeseektime('4270')">1:11:10</a> say stop I tell you stop and they said  
<a onclick="modifyYTiframeseektime('4272')">1:11:12</a> why like whoa on you stop and start  
<a onclick="modifyYTiframeseektime('4275')">1:11:15</a> doing the drink  
<a onclick="modifyYTiframeseektime('4277')">1:11:17</a> because the man think I should wait a  
<a onclick="modifyYTiframeseektime('4279')">1:11:19</a> little bit maybe five two more minutes  
<a onclick="modifyYTiframeseektime('4280')">1:11:20</a> two more minutes that's more bias  
<a onclick="modifyYTiframeseektime('4283')">1:11:23</a> and then it goes more and more and more  
<a onclick="modifyYTiframeseektime('4285')">1:11:25</a> and more and more until you continue  
<a onclick="modifyYTiframeseektime('4287')">1:11:27</a> until next sahore like some people try

<a onclick="modifyYTiframeseektime('4390')">1:13:10</a> you often give an example of uh the man

<a onclick="modifyYTiframeseektime('4398')">1:13:18</a> yeah can you explain how this kind of  
<a onclick="modifyYTiframeseektime('4401')">1:13:21</a> relates to this because that because on  
<a onclick="modifyYTiframeseektime('4402')">1:13:22</a> this subject what they call it a Divine  
<a onclick="modifyYTiframeseektime('4405')">1:13:25</a> drama or Divine Comedy like uh the one  
<a onclick="modifyYTiframeseektime('4408')">1:13:28</a> of Dante but it's not a common sadama  
<a onclick="modifyYTiframeseektime('4410')">1:13:30</a> oh you can't call it comedy if you want  
<a onclick="modifyYTiframeseektime('4412')">1:13:32</a> uh um anything that is various channels  
<a onclick="modifyYTiframeseektime('4414')">1:13:34</a> so most of them are weak but if you put

<a onclick="modifyYTiframeseektime('4418')">1:13:38</a> come to the conclusion that once the

<a onclick="modifyYTiframeseektime('4426')">1:13:46</a> and we were talking about and then we  
<a onclick="modifyYTiframeseektime('4428')">1:13:48</a> mentioned a man who is known for extreme

<a onclick="modifyYTiframeseektime('4432')">1:13:52</a> and was frustrating in Jihad is not only

<a onclick="modifyYTiframeseektime('4447')">1:14:07</a> not attend the Halal he's not gaining  
<a onclick="modifyYTiframeseektime('4449')">1:14:09</a> knowledge  
<a onclick="modifyYTiframeseektime('4451')">1:14:11</a> make a note on that and Allah put it as

<a onclick="modifyYTiframeseektime('4473')">1:14:33</a> there far away from the end  
<a onclick="modifyYTiframeseektime('4478')">1:14:38</a> this is the man we are talking about he  
<a onclick="modifyYTiframeseektime('4480')">1:14:40</a> is he is coming and he first looked at  
<a onclick="modifyYTiframeseektime('4483')">1:14:43</a> him say this one  
<a onclick="modifyYTiframeseektime('4486')">1:14:46</a> I don't know yet but I see in his face

<a onclick="modifyYTiframeseektime('4491')">1:14:51</a> shocking  
<a onclick="modifyYTiframeseektime('4493')">1:14:53</a> that's because the prophetess have  
<a onclick="modifyYTiframeseektime('4495')">1:14:55</a> spirituality and receive why the others  
<a onclick="modifyYTiframeseektime('4497')">1:14:57</a> do not see see only the external work  
<a onclick="modifyYTiframeseektime('4501')">1:15:01</a> and then the birds want to teach them  
<a onclick="modifyYTiframeseektime('4502')">1:15:02</a> why he has a strike of the devil  
<a onclick="modifyYTiframeseektime('4504')">1:15:04</a> so when he came close he said Salaam I'm

<a onclick="modifyYTiframeseektime('4521')">1:15:21</a> others at least let's assume that let's  
<a onclick="modifyYTiframeseektime('4523')">1:15:23</a> let's give the man a better benefit of  
<a onclick="modifyYTiframeseektime('4525')">1:15:25</a> the doubt unlikely that he thinks it's  
<a onclick="modifyYTiframeseektime('4527')">1:15:27</a> better than the prophet but  
<a onclick="modifyYTiframeseektime('4529')">1:15:29</a> the man who is thoughtful say Allah by  
<a onclick="modifyYTiframeseektime('4533')">1:15:33</a> Allah yes  
<a onclick="modifyYTiframeseektime('4537')">1:15:37</a> now we know what this is

<a onclick="modifyYTiframeseektime('4549')">1:15:49</a> than he proceeded does he sit and ask  
<a onclick="modifyYTiframeseektime('4552')">1:15:52</a> why you are asking me what's going on  
<a onclick="modifyYTiframeseektime('4553')">1:15:53</a> why the strange question no no he

<a onclick="modifyYTiframeseektime('4566')">1:16:06</a> to pass at the messenger allow people  
<a onclick="modifyYTiframeseektime('4568')">1:16:08</a> sitting and he asks you such a straight  
<a onclick="modifyYTiframeseektime('4569')">1:16:09</a> question wouldn't you sit as I said why  
<a onclick="modifyYTiframeseektime('4572')">1:16:12</a> are you asking me this question  
<a onclick="modifyYTiframeseektime('4574')">1:16:14</a> strange question what's happening

<a onclick="modifyYTiframeseektime('4588')">1:16:28</a> living in the machine doing Quran and so  
<a onclick="modifyYTiframeseektime('4590')">1:16:30</a> on

<a onclick="modifyYTiframeseektime('4595')">1:16:35</a> others so it was really an important  
<a onclick="modifyYTiframeseektime('4597')">1:16:37</a> Catholic  
<a onclick="modifyYTiframeseektime('4599')">1:16:39</a> imagine he thinks it's better this

<a onclick="modifyYTiframeseektime('4603')">1:16:43</a> the prophet but let's say we will not go  
<a onclick="modifyYTiframeseektime('4605')">1:16:45</a> to that extreme  
<a onclick="modifyYTiframeseektime('4609')">1:16:49</a> a strange command or request

<a onclick="modifyYTiframeseektime('4890')">1:21:30</a> the correct way to doing it giving a

<a onclick="modifyYTiframeseektime('4899')">1:21:39</a> so Ali will be doing it the correct way

<a onclick="modifyYTiframeseektime('4914')">1:21:54</a> so backup this is a great virtue that  
<a onclick="modifyYTiframeseektime('4916')">1:21:56</a> you would be the one fighting for the  
<a onclick="modifyYTiframeseektime('4917')">1:21:57</a> meaning of the Quran in the time which  
<a onclick="modifyYTiframeseektime('4919')">1:21:59</a> is misinterpreted so it is Allah  
<a onclick="modifyYTiframeseektime('4922')">1:22:02</a> no not you mama said me I want to be  
<a onclick="modifyYTiframeseektime('4925')">1:22:05</a> happy this great honor say no so who is  
<a onclick="modifyYTiframeseektime('4928')">1:22:08</a> it then say the one who is fixing my my

<a onclick="modifyYTiframeseektime('4941')">1:22:21</a> because he could not find it now that's

<a onclick="modifyYTiframeseektime('4944')">1:22:24</a> so there's also a projection of the

<a onclick="modifyYTiframeseektime('4954')">1:22:34</a> very true and so on this is important by  
<a onclick="modifyYTiframeseektime('4956')">1:22:36</a> itself that is understanding the point  
<a onclick="modifyYTiframeseektime('4958')">1:22:38</a> here is that  
<a onclick="modifyYTiframeseektime('4960')">1:22:40</a> the mentality of demand

<a onclick="modifyYTiframeseektime('4965')">1:22:45</a> yes the Quran or do you think he has  
<a onclick="modifyYTiframeseektime('4968')">1:22:48</a> digested it probably  
<a onclick="modifyYTiframeseektime('4970')">1:22:50</a> because  
<a onclick="modifyYTiframeseektime('4974')">1:22:54</a> you have to refer the Sunnah  
<a onclick="modifyYTiframeseektime('4977')">1:22:57</a> in its totality obviously  
<a onclick="modifyYTiframeseektime('4980')">1:23:00</a> and even even if you don't have a Sunnah  
<a onclick="modifyYTiframeseektime('4983')">1:23:03</a> it had like a uh when Allah  
<a onclick="modifyYTiframeseektime('4993')">1:23:13</a> with the provision you read it and  
<a onclick="modifyYTiframeseektime('4995')">1:23:15</a> digest it  
<a onclick="modifyYTiframeseektime('4997')">1:23:17</a> and you read it all of it  
<a onclick="modifyYTiframeseektime('4998')">1:23:18</a> is  
<a onclick="modifyYTiframeseektime('5002')">1:23:22</a> then if you go through it all of it  
<a onclick="modifyYTiframeseektime('5004')">1:23:24</a> interconnected it properly analyze it  
<a onclick="modifyYTiframeseektime('5007')">1:23:27</a> consistently then if they logic in your  
<a onclick="modifyYTiframeseektime('5010')">1:23:30</a> mind it must be of divine origin there's  
<a onclick="modifyYTiframeseektime('5012')">1:23:32</a> only one Divinity there's a day of  
<a onclick="modifyYTiframeseektime('5014')">1:23:34</a> judgment that's the address

<a onclick="modifyYTiframeseektime('5037')">1:23:57</a> the fact that  
<a onclick="modifyYTiframeseektime('5039')">1:23:59</a> um this person so for example you you  
<a onclick="modifyYTiframeseektime('5040')">1:24:00</a> previously mentioned about the huarach  
<a onclick="modifyYTiframeseektime('5042')">1:24:02</a> how they when it when it says that it  
<a onclick="modifyYTiframeseektime('5044')">1:24:04</a> doesn't go deep in the throats you you  
<a onclick="modifyYTiframeseektime('5046')">1:24:06</a> also you you made the argument that

<a onclick="modifyYTiframeseektime('5056')">1:24:16</a> there is the place of knowledge like the

<a onclick="modifyYTiframeseektime('5073')">1:24:33</a> the knowledge goes in the sudden

<a onclick="modifyYTiframeseektime('5077')">1:24:37</a> it's a metaphorical one  
<a onclick="modifyYTiframeseektime('5079')">1:24:39</a> and even if the Quran says it is it is  
<a onclick="modifyYTiframeseektime('5081')">1:24:41</a> not it is not the the eyes which become  
<a onclick="modifyYTiframeseektime('5085')">1:24:45</a> blind it is the heart which is in the

<a onclick="modifyYTiframeseektime('5129')">1:25:29</a> is here I'm going still this time

<a onclick="modifyYTiframeseektime('5134')">1:25:34</a> people go into extreme things that

<a onclick="modifyYTiframeseektime('5140')">1:25:40</a> transplantation we know that when you

<a onclick="modifyYTiframeseektime('5316')">1:28:36</a> that's a question

<a onclick="modifyYTiframeseektime('5323')">1:28:43</a> would understood that that this ruling  
<a onclick="modifyYTiframeseektime('5325')">1:28:45</a> is something else than what they  
<a onclick="modifyYTiframeseektime('5327')">1:28:47</a> objected to alibner agreeing to have uh  
<a onclick="modifyYTiframeseektime('5330')">1:28:50</a> arbitration it's not arbitration all the  
<a onclick="modifyYTiframeseektime('5332')">1:28:52</a> Declaration was a political mistake and  
<a onclick="modifyYTiframeseektime('5334')">1:28:54</a> Ali said if this is the trick but they  
<a onclick="modifyYTiframeseektime('5335')">1:28:55</a> don't obey him okay fine but in the  
<a onclick="modifyYTiframeseektime('5337')">1:28:57</a> village of that has nothing to do with  
<a onclick="modifyYTiframeseektime('5339')">1:28:59</a> with the with violating it's ruling only  
<a onclick="modifyYTiframeseektime('5342')">1:29:02</a> for Allah  
<a onclick="modifyYTiframeseektime('5347')">1:29:07</a> a game  
<a onclick="modifyYTiframeseektime('5350')">1:29:10</a> that we have to get to to write as men  
<a onclick="modifyYTiframeseektime('5353')">1:29:13</a> who who make a ruling about what is the

<a onclick="modifyYTiframeseektime('5360')">1:29:20</a> discussed result in my area for example  
<a onclick="modifyYTiframeseektime('5365')">1:29:25</a> for example  
<a onclick="modifyYTiframeseektime('5368')">1:29:28</a> so it's a couple of observations  
<a onclick="modifyYTiframeseektime('5369')">1:29:29</a> actually various two rulings to Allah  
<a onclick="modifyYTiframeseektime('5372')">1:29:32</a> what is  
<a onclick="modifyYTiframeseektime('5375')">1:29:35</a> they thought every ruling including the  
<a onclick="modifyYTiframeseektime('5377')">1:29:37</a> arbitration  
<a onclick="modifyYTiframeseektime('5379')">1:29:39</a> is is only for Allah no it's not true  
<a onclick="modifyYTiframeseektime('5381')">1:29:41</a> Allah order to others  
<a onclick="modifyYTiframeseektime('5384')">1:29:44</a> so what is the ruling which is exclusive  
<a onclick="modifyYTiframeseektime('5386')">1:29:46</a> for Allah that has to be said understand  
<a onclick="modifyYTiframeseektime('5388')">1:29:48</a> our book of the year which is almost the  
<a onclick="modifyYTiframeseektime('5391')">1:29:51</a> translation is almost finished I  
<a onclick="modifyYTiframeseektime('5393')">1:29:53</a> understand  
<a onclick="modifyYTiframeseektime('5394')">1:29:54</a> yeah yeah I think you are editing the  
<a onclick="modifyYTiframeseektime('5396')">1:29:56</a> final version yeah  
<a onclick="modifyYTiframeseektime('5398')">1:29:58</a> it's sorted out after a long deep  
<a onclick="modifyYTiframeseektime('5401')">1:30:01</a> discussion invoking essentially a Quran  
<a onclick="modifyYTiframeseektime('5403')">1:30:03</a> necessary reason we don't even use a  
<a onclick="modifyYTiframeseektime('5404')">1:30:04</a> Hadith for that so if they have read the  
<a onclick="modifyYTiframeseektime('5407')">1:30:07</a> Quran and digested it  
<a onclick="modifyYTiframeseektime('5410')">1:30:10</a> they would have reached that conclusion  
<a onclick="modifyYTiframeseektime('5412')">1:30:12</a> or a similar code maybe not as  
<a onclick="modifyYTiframeseektime('5414')">1:30:14</a> sophisticated this one in our book is  
<a onclick="modifyYTiframeseektime('5416')">1:30:16</a> sophisticated because I'm building on  
<a onclick="modifyYTiframeseektime('5418')">1:30:18</a> knowledge and discussion over 1400 years  
<a onclick="modifyYTiframeseektime('5421')">1:30:21</a> for God's sake that will make you more  
<a onclick="modifyYTiframeseektime('5423')">1:30:23</a> sophisticated more advanced we develop  
<a onclick="modifyYTiframeseektime('5425')">1:30:25</a> things and let us say the 14th 15th  
<a onclick="modifyYTiframeseektime('5428')">1:30:28</a> generation like a car of the first  
<a onclick="modifyYTiframeseektime('5430')">1:30:30</a> International be most sophisticated and  
<a onclick="modifyYTiframeseektime('5432')">1:30:32</a> Polished than the illegals or go around  
<a onclick="modifyYTiframeseektime('5442')">1:30:42</a> they don't get they got a pile of junk  
<a onclick="modifyYTiframeseektime('5445')">1:30:45</a> and in Detroit  
<a onclick="modifyYTiframeseektime('5448')">1:30:48</a> themselves for the ummah and was able to  
<a onclick="modifyYTiframeseektime('5451')">1:30:51</a> get away and I suspect that even more  
<a onclick="modifyYTiframeseektime('5453')">1:30:53</a> how you penetrated them and instigated  
<a onclick="modifyYTiframeseektime('5455')">1:30:55</a> them and played with their work most  
<a onclick="modifyYTiframeseektime('5457')">1:30:57</a> likely and they're very very many hints  
<a onclick="modifyYTiframeseektime('5459')">1:30:59</a> indicating that he was playing the  
<a onclick="modifyYTiframeseektime('5460')">1:31:00</a> string so bad the scene but that's not  
<a onclick="modifyYTiframeseektime('5462')">1:31:02</a> our issue  
<a onclick="modifyYTiframeseektime('5463')">1:31:03</a> so part of that also because they think  
<a onclick="modifyYTiframeseektime('5466')">1:31:06</a> they have with this blubbering and  
<a onclick="modifyYTiframeseektime('5468')">1:31:08</a> reading just shallow reading they got  
<a onclick="modifyYTiframeseektime('5470')">1:31:10</a> all their knowledge so they don't bother  
<a onclick="modifyYTiframeseektime('5473')">1:31:13</a> about asking companies that asking other  
<a onclick="modifyYTiframeseektime('5475')">1:31:15</a> scholar people so there's there seems to  
<a onclick="modifyYTiframeseektime('5478')">1:31:18</a> be very close parallels in two respects  
<a onclick="modifyYTiframeseektime('5480')">1:31:20</a> with this individual and the wahhabi  
<a onclick="modifyYTiframeseektime('5482')">1:31:22</a> movement so just to jump ahead slightly  
<a onclick="modifyYTiframeseektime('5484')">1:31:24</a> exactly so for example the one thing is  
<a onclick="modifyYTiframeseektime('5486')">1:31:26</a> you know you mentioned about the number  
<a onclick="modifyYTiframeseektime('5488')">1:31:28</a> of Quran you see very clearly right now  
<a onclick="modifyYTiframeseektime('5491')">1:31:31</a> in this current issue  
<a onclick="modifyYTiframeseektime('5493')">1:31:33</a> what they do is they don't even  
<a onclick="modifyYTiframeseektime('5497')">1:31:37</a> uh show all the Hadith related to a  
<a onclick="modifyYTiframeseektime('5499')">1:31:39</a> given subject matter so for example they  
<a onclick="modifyYTiframeseektime('5502')">1:31:42</a> build we're obviously going to cover  
<a onclick="modifyYTiframeseektime('5503')">1:31:43</a> this in a few minutes but they build a  
<a onclick="modifyYTiframeseektime('5505')">1:31:45</a> they build a narrative about de facto  
<a onclick="modifyYTiframeseektime('5508')">1:31:48</a> default position everyone agrees that  
<a onclick="modifyYTiframeseektime('5510')">1:31:50</a> you can't rebel against a ruler you  
<a onclick="modifyYTiframeseektime('5512')">1:31:52</a> can't say anything against the ruler and  
<a onclick="modifyYTiframeseektime('5514')">1:31:54</a> then they build this narrative  
<a onclick="modifyYTiframeseektime('5516')">1:31:56</a> while ignoring all the Hadith which talk  
<a onclick="modifyYTiframeseektime('5520')">1:32:00</a> about when you turn the Quran before  
<a onclick="modifyYTiframeseektime('5521')">1:32:01</a> that  
<a onclick="modifyYTiframeseektime('5523')">1:32:03</a> the Quran before that because the Quran  
<a onclick="modifyYTiframeseektime('5525')">1:32:05</a> where weather will admission the Quran  
<a onclick="modifyYTiframeseektime('5528')">1:32:08</a> in only two places one place is the eye  
<a onclick="modifyYTiframeseektime('5531')">1:32:11</a> of famous eye of buildings  
<a onclick="modifyYTiframeseektime('5532')">1:32:12</a> so obey Allah  
<a onclick="modifyYTiframeseektime('5535')">1:32:15</a> and obey his messenger with the  
<a onclick="modifyYTiframeseektime('5537')">1:32:17</a> repeating the word obey because the  
<a onclick="modifyYTiframeseektime('5538')">1:32:18</a> obedient messenger is separate and  
<a onclick="modifyYTiframeseektime('5540')">1:32:20</a> additional why because of Allah because  
<a onclick="modifyYTiframeseektime('5545')">1:32:25</a> the machine is unvaluable we know the  
<a onclick="modifyYTiframeseektime('5547')">1:32:27</a> message is not Allah he's a human being  
<a onclick="modifyYTiframeseektime('5550')">1:32:30</a> he's not eternal  
<a onclick="modifyYTiframeseektime('5552')">1:32:32</a> he's a female  
<a onclick="modifyYTiframeseektime('5554')">1:32:34</a> it will be recircuited for eternity the  
<a onclick="modifyYTiframeseektime('5556')">1:32:36</a> hopefully all of us in Paradise but he  
<a onclick="modifyYTiframeseektime('5558')">1:32:38</a> is not by his own essential being a  
<a onclick="modifyYTiframeseektime('5561')">1:32:41</a> necessary being so his obedience is  
<a onclick="modifyYTiframeseektime('5564')">1:32:44</a> essentially because he's reporting Alpha  
<a onclick="modifyYTiframeseektime('5566')">1:32:46</a> life from Allah so this is like obeying  
<a onclick="modifyYTiframeseektime('5568')">1:32:48</a> Allah obey obedience is saved clearly so  
<a onclick="modifyYTiframeseektime('5571')">1:32:51</a> nobody is at Liberty when you see when  
<a onclick="modifyYTiframeseektime('5573')">1:32:53</a> he receives the Hadith proved to be  
<a onclick="modifyYTiframeseektime('5575')">1:32:55</a> authentic but possible to say no I'm not  
<a onclick="modifyYTiframeseektime('5578')">1:32:58</a> going to obey because it's not a Quran  
<a onclick="modifyYTiframeseektime('5580')">1:33:00</a> no we are not that Liberty you become  
<a onclick="modifyYTiframeseektime('5581')">1:33:01</a> Catholic this way  
<a onclick="modifyYTiframeseektime('5584')">1:33:04</a> by this position the studies in the  
<a onclick="modifyYTiframeseektime('5586')">1:33:06</a> Quran the extreme Quran you say the  
<a onclick="modifyYTiframeseektime('5588')">1:33:08</a> Sunnah by itself is not is not binding  
<a onclick="modifyYTiframeseektime('5593')">1:33:13</a> yeah this is meaning if I hear it even  
<a onclick="modifyYTiframeseektime('5596')">1:33:16</a> from the messenger  
<a onclick="modifyYTiframeseektime('5598')">1:33:18</a> I'm not going to obey I obey on the  
<a onclick="modifyYTiframeseektime('5599')">1:33:19</a> otherwise  
<a onclick="modifyYTiframeseektime('5609')">1:33:29</a> without the word obey again meaning it  
<a onclick="modifyYTiframeseektime('5612')">1:33:32</a> is a minor level it is just an appendix  
<a onclick="modifyYTiframeseektime('5615')">1:33:35</a> and then after that the addition where  
<a onclick="modifyYTiframeseektime('5617')">1:33:37</a> they stop most of the time they don't  
<a onclick="modifyYTiframeseektime('5636')">1:33:56</a> most likely from the from the context he  
<a onclick="modifyYTiframeseektime('5639')">1:33:59</a> means mainly the dispute between you and  
<a onclick="modifyYTiframeseektime('5641')">1:34:01</a> the rulers but also between you and  
<a onclick="modifyYTiframeseektime('5643')">1:34:03</a> others is it loaded but the dispute here  
<a onclick="modifyYTiframeseektime('5646')">1:34:06</a> is focused morally not excluded but not  
<a onclick="modifyYTiframeseektime('5649')">1:34:09</a> worth it so if you have this filter the  
<a onclick="modifyYTiframeseektime('5650')">1:34:10</a> rulers  
<a onclick="modifyYTiframeseektime('5657')">1:34:17</a> his messenger  
<a onclick="modifyYTiframeseektime('5659')">1:34:19</a> if you believe in Allah of judgment  
<a onclick="modifyYTiframeseektime('5661')">1:34:21</a> that's the only way to go and this will  
<a onclick="modifyYTiframeseektime('5664')">1:34:24</a> have the final conclusion the better  
<a onclick="modifyYTiframeseektime('5665')">1:34:25</a> result another place where the other  
<a onclick="modifyYTiframeseektime('5667')">1:34:27</a> upcoming is that  
<a onclick="modifyYTiframeseektime('5669')">1:34:29</a> rebuilding and those those are those

<a onclick="modifyYTiframeseektime('5676')">1:34:36</a> if they receive any news about which

<a onclick="modifyYTiframeseektime('7023')">1:57:03</a> and that here's something characteristic  
<a onclick="modifyYTiframeseektime('7025')">1:57:05</a> happened is that  
<a onclick="modifyYTiframeseektime('7027')">1:57:07</a> it was full  
<a onclick="modifyYTiframeseektime('7029')">1:57:09</a> as usual in the recent 20 30 years the

<a onclick="modifyYTiframeseektime('7033')">1:57:13</a> and then they have arranged things like  
<a onclick="modifyYTiframeseektime('7034')">1:57:14</a> that and the police was blocking the way  
<a onclick="modifyYTiframeseektime('7036')">1:57:16</a> inside Arafat  
<a onclick="modifyYTiframeseektime('7038')">1:57:18</a> okay

<a onclick="modifyYTiframeseektime('7043')">1:57:23</a> and it was blocked  
<a onclick="modifyYTiframeseektime('7045')">1:57:25</a> and I told the police we were to go in  
<a onclick="modifyYTiframeseektime('7047')">1:57:27</a> Arafat and they stubborn they don't know  
<a onclick="modifyYTiframeseektime('7049')">1:57:29</a> that is full then you can extend outside  
<a onclick="modifyYTiframeseektime('7052')">1:57:32</a> because you have to have a festival for

<a onclick="modifyYTiframeseektime('7067')">1:57:47</a> beat up the police remove the blocks and

<a onclick="modifyYTiframeseektime('7116')">1:58:36</a> talk is is trivial  
<a onclick="modifyYTiframeseektime('7119')">1:58:39</a> addressing

<a onclick="modifyYTiframeseektime('7128')">1:58:48</a> first of all blocking like that is not  
<a onclick="modifyYTiframeseektime('7130')">1:58:50</a> appropriate there's no need to block if  
<a onclick="modifyYTiframeseektime('7133')">1:58:53</a> Alpha become full the buses and the cars  
<a onclick="modifyYTiframeseektime('7136')">1:58:56</a> will be will be backing up backing up  
<a onclick="modifyYTiframeseektime('7138')">1:58:58</a> until the border of Alpha and then you  
<a onclick="modifyYTiframeseektime('7139')">1:58:59</a> come and see everything back up nothing  
<a onclick="modifyYTiframeseektime('7141')">1:59:01</a> can be done you have to stand there but  
<a onclick="modifyYTiframeseektime('7144')">1:59:04</a> most people are ignorant that in that

<a onclick="modifyYTiframeseektime('7152')">1:59:12</a> people need a structure people like you  
<a onclick="modifyYTiframeseektime('7155')">1:59:15</a> a massage like you should issues that  
<a onclick="modifyYTiframeseektime('7157')">1:59:17</a> fight or with authority to solve this  
<a onclick="modifyYTiframeseektime('7159')">1:59:19</a> problem so we don't get police breathing  
<a onclick="modifyYTiframeseektime('7160')">1:59:20</a> or particular meeting and both of both  
<a onclick="modifyYTiframeseektime('7162')">1:59:22</a> have lost their height the weight of

<a onclick="modifyYTiframeseektime('7168')">1:59:28</a> violence  
<a onclick="modifyYTiframeseektime('7171')">1:59:31</a> and also maybe you should advise The

<a onclick="modifyYTiframeseektime('7175')">1:59:35</a> police otherwise that's not problem to  
<a onclick="modifyYTiframeseektime('7177')">1:59:37</a> treat like that when you say that  
<a onclick="modifyYTiframeseektime('7179')">1:59:39</a> Authority a man I don't know him at that  
<a onclick="modifyYTiframeseektime('7182')">1:59:42</a> time looks like  
<a onclick="modifyYTiframeseektime('7184')">1:59:44</a> a lot without any abuse like a lot  
<a onclick="modifyYTiframeseektime('7189')">1:59:49</a> smaller  
<a onclick="modifyYTiframeseektime('7190')">1:59:50</a> the first impression in my mind that is  
<a onclick="modifyYTiframeseektime('7192')">1:59:52</a> the rat not a human being  
<a onclick="modifyYTiframeseektime('7195')">1:59:55</a> someone was asking about that he's told  
<a onclick="modifyYTiframeseektime('7198')">1:59:58</a> before and God went back to stoning  
<a onclick="modifyYTiframeseektime('7200')">2:00:00</a> before after learning some trivial  
<a onclick="modifyYTiframeseektime('7201')">2:00:01</a> questions  
<a onclick="modifyYTiframeseektime('7203')">2:00:03</a> that attention was diverted I heard you  
<a onclick="modifyYTiframeseektime('7206')">2:00:06</a> this is celebrity by their dismissal  
<a onclick="modifyYTiframeseektime('7208')">2:00:08</a> with this rat so after we left  
<a onclick="modifyYTiframeseektime('7213')">2:00:13</a> who came and spoiled a meaty discussion  
<a onclick="modifyYTiframeseektime('7216')">2:00:16</a> this is a little bit more meaty than  
<a onclick="modifyYTiframeseektime('7218')">2:00:18</a> discussing High politics this is how to  
<a onclick="modifyYTiframeseektime('7220')">2:00:20</a> extend Alpha how to manage the huge

<a onclick="modifyYTiframeseektime('7225')">2:00:25</a> stoning before or after and so Before  
<a onclick="modifyYTiframeseektime('7226')">2:00:26</a> Sunset after Sunset and so on it's valid  
<a onclick="modifyYTiframeseektime('7229')">2:00:29</a> invalid should we repeat

<a onclick="modifyYTiframeseektime('7249')">2:00:49</a> so on I had a result went around  
<a onclick="modifyYTiframeseektime('7251')">2:00:51</a> at the time the regime was I think  
<a onclick="modifyYTiframeseektime('7253')">2:00:53</a> that's the reason I think it was 91 or  
<a onclick="modifyYTiframeseektime('7255')">2:00:55</a> 92 that that happened the regime was so  
<a onclick="modifyYTiframeseektime('7258')">2:00:58</a> weak and then the disgraced that they  
<a onclick="modifyYTiframeseektime('7261')">2:01:01</a> didn't dare defend anybody so I got away  
<a onclick="modifyYTiframeseektime('7262')">2:01:02</a> with this  
<a onclick="modifyYTiframeseektime('7263')">2:01:03</a> but he responded in his in he made the

<a onclick="modifyYTiframeseektime('7284')">2:01:24</a> which is that this is like this that so  
<a onclick="modifyYTiframeseektime('7286')">2:01:26</a> he's mentioned by Crystal there so as  
<a onclick="modifyYTiframeseektime('7288')">2:01:28</a> there was an interaction intellectually  
<a onclick="modifyYTiframeseektime('7289')">2:01:29</a> before that and this was a that action  
<a onclick="modifyYTiframeseektime('7291')">2:01:31</a> face to face  
<a onclick="modifyYTiframeseektime('7293')">2:01:33</a> and after that nothing good we hear from

<a onclick="modifyYTiframeseektime('7297')">2:01:37</a> as a matter of fact there are very good  
<a onclick="modifyYTiframeseektime('7299')">2:01:39</a> evidence I don't say it's an absolute  
<a onclick="modifyYTiframeseektime('7300')">2:01:40</a> evidence only where I can't make an oath  
<a onclick="modifyYTiframeseektime('7302')">2:01:42</a> on it but it's very strong from various  
<a onclick="modifyYTiframeseektime('7303')">2:01:43</a> sources that they saw his name in the

<a onclick="modifyYTiframeseektime('7309')">2:01:49</a> issued monthly and he was listed I think  
<a onclick="modifyYTiframeseektime('7312')">2:01:52</a> with the rhyme of uh major so on with  
<a onclick="modifyYTiframeseektime('7315')">2:01:55</a> this with that Crown this one star two

<a onclick="modifyYTiframeseektime('7319')">2:01:59</a> major I think major Captain something  
<a onclick="modifyYTiframeseektime('7321')">2:02:01</a> like that in in the second police  
<a onclick="modifyYTiframeseektime('7324')">2:02:04</a> so a man allows him to work as a spy  
<a onclick="modifyYTiframeseektime('7328')">2:02:08</a> in a religion respiring is absolutely

<a onclick="modifyYTiframeseektime('7338')">2:02:18</a> but this the other one is based on a

<a onclick="modifyYTiframeseektime('7349')">2:02:29</a> the money says is

<a onclick="modifyYTiframeseektime('7362')">2:02:42</a> time  
<a onclick="modifyYTiframeseektime('7365')">2:02:45</a> with the discussion with it and  
<a onclick="modifyYTiframeseektime('7368')">2:02:48</a> diverting the issue is clearly that the  
<a onclick="modifyYTiframeseektime('7371')">2:02:51</a> whole Markov of 15 they attend to  
<a onclick="modifyYTiframeseektime('7374')">2:02:54</a> Scholars simple-minded or scale or or  
<a onclick="modifyYTiframeseektime('7376')">2:02:56</a> coward scholar even if it means they're  
<a onclick="modifyYTiframeseektime('7378')">2:02:58</a> covered he admitted himself publicly to  
<a onclick="modifyYTiframeseektime('7381')">2:03:01</a> many people that is a God and he doesn't  
<a onclick="modifyYTiframeseektime('7383')">2:03:03</a> that day something or even buzzer so  
<a onclick="modifyYTiframeseektime('7385')">2:03:05</a> it's not a coward but it's weak it's  
<a onclick="modifyYTiframeseektime('7387')">2:03:07</a> just a message  
<a onclick="modifyYTiframeseektime('7395')">2:03:15</a> they attend to these Scholars and either  
<a onclick="modifyYTiframeseektime('7398')">2:03:18</a> put stupid questions so they get all the  
<a onclick="modifyYTiframeseektime('7400')">2:03:20</a> the session wasted for nonsensical  
<a onclick="modifyYTiframeseektime('7402')">2:03:22</a> questions or uh or uh or they if there's  
<a onclick="modifyYTiframeseektime('7408')">2:03:28</a> any immediate discussion happens then  
<a onclick="modifyYTiframeseektime('7410')">2:03:30</a> they cross me with with the with the  
<a onclick="modifyYTiframeseektime('7412')">2:03:32</a> nasty question to divert that attention  
<a onclick="modifyYTiframeseektime('7414')">2:03:34</a> I just then deliver it it's intelligent  
<a onclick="modifyYTiframeseektime('7416')">2:03:36</a> service work does not scholarly work  
<a onclick="modifyYTiframeseektime('7418')">2:03:38</a> that's not people who think that they  
<a onclick="modifyYTiframeseektime('7420')">2:03:40</a> will meet it when they Allah might be  
<a onclick="modifyYTiframeseektime('7422')">2:03:42</a> questioned it doesn't look like that so  
<a onclick="modifyYTiframeseektime('7424')">2:03:44</a> what they what they do is they they it's  
<a onclick="modifyYTiframeseektime('7427')">2:03:47</a> red herricks basically red herring is  
<a onclick="modifyYTiframeseektime('7428')">2:03:48</a> something of that distraction so another  
<a onclick="modifyYTiframeseektime('7430')">2:03:50</a> one for example this fixation on bidder  
<a onclick="modifyYTiframeseektime('7433')">2:03:53</a> this fixation on so for example Builders  
<a onclick="modifyYTiframeseektime('7436')">2:03:56</a> are an interesting one so by them making  
<a onclick="modifyYTiframeseektime('7438')">2:03:58</a> better or more today or for example is  
<a onclick="modifyYTiframeseektime('7441')">2:04:01</a> another big one in terms of  
<a onclick="modifyYTiframeseektime('7443')">2:04:03</a> um  
<a onclick="modifyYTiframeseektime('7444')">2:04:04</a> it's based on their own beta of  
<a onclick="modifyYTiframeseektime('7446')">2:04:06</a> definition of of uh of uh definition of  
<a onclick="modifyYTiframeseektime('7450')">2:04:10</a> illa this is beta it's not a definition  
<a onclick="modifyYTiframeseektime('7451')">2:04:11</a> of the Quran so they invented the  
<a onclick="modifyYTiframeseektime('7453')">2:04:13</a> definition  
<a onclick="modifyYTiframeseektime('7462')">2:04:22</a> then it becomes itself  
<a onclick="modifyYTiframeseektime('7465')">2:04:25</a> honestly I'm creating definition as  
<a onclick="modifyYTiframeseektime('7467')">2:04:27</a> there you can as a mathematician  
<a onclick="modifyYTiframeseektime('7468')">2:04:28</a> mathematical definition as even a  
<a onclick="modifyYTiframeseektime('7471')">2:04:31</a> scholarship you can't define something  
<a onclick="modifyYTiframeseektime('7473')">2:04:33</a> division you give the correct definition  
<a onclick="modifyYTiframeseektime('7475')">2:04:35</a> and so on but if we make that definition  
<a onclick="modifyYTiframeseektime('7478')">2:04:38</a> declare is the deal that's the only way  
<a onclick="modifyYTiframeseektime('7480')">2:04:40</a> to go  
<a onclick="modifyYTiframeseektime('7481')">2:04:41</a> that's number one or  
<a onclick="modifyYTiframeseektime('7484')">2:04:44</a> you you you're based on it something  
<a onclick="modifyYTiframeseektime('7486')">2:04:46</a> within then this definition then become  
<a onclick="modifyYTiframeseektime('7488')">2:04:48</a> a better  
<a onclick="modifyYTiframeseektime('7490')">2:04:50</a> if if it's not a correct definition  
<a onclick="modifyYTiframeseektime('7492')">2:04:52</a> according to the Quran it is then  
<a onclick="modifyYTiframeseektime('7494')">2:04:54</a> created and then declared to be a dean  
<a onclick="modifyYTiframeseektime('7496')">2:04:56</a> and worse if it is contradicts the Quran  
<a onclick="modifyYTiframeseektime('7498')">2:04:58</a> like the illah is the God is that the  
<a onclick="modifyYTiframeseektime('7501')">2:05:01</a> worship the deity is the things which is  
<a onclick="modifyYTiframeseektime('7504')">2:05:04</a> worshiped  
<a onclick="modifyYTiframeseektime('7513')">2:05:13</a> in chapter 7 8 9 and so on and uh that's  
<a onclick="modifyYTiframeseektime('7518')">2:05:18</a> a clear heresy obviously a person can be  
<a onclick="modifyYTiframeseektime('7520')">2:05:20</a> excused by ignorance or what it may be  
<a onclick="modifyYTiframeseektime('7521')">2:05:21</a> so all of that is  
<a onclick="modifyYTiframeseektime('7523')">2:05:23</a> declaring that touching the graves and  
<a onclick="modifyYTiframeseektime('7525')">2:05:25</a> visiting the people in the grave and  
<a onclick="modifyYTiframeseektime('7527')">2:05:27</a> asking them for this asking for them and  
<a onclick="modifyYTiframeseektime('7528')">2:05:28</a> so on they claim that is  
<a onclick="modifyYTiframeseektime('7532')">2:05:32</a> that that naming itself is because if if  
<a onclick="modifyYTiframeseektime('7536')">2:05:36</a> that has any standing we would have a  
<a onclick="modifyYTiframeseektime('7538')">2:05:38</a> Hadith or a Quran mentioning worshiping  
<a onclick="modifyYTiframeseektime('7540')">2:05:40</a> a game anywhere there's none whatsoever  
<a onclick="modifyYTiframeseektime('7542')">2:05:42</a> the only thing they are related on is  
<a onclick="modifyYTiframeseektime('7544')">2:05:44</a> that a faulty narration in bukhari  
<a onclick="modifyYTiframeseektime('7546')">2:05:46</a> allegedly  
<a onclick="modifyYTiframeseektime('7548')">2:05:48</a> we have proven that is also but even if  
<a onclick="modifyYTiframeseektime('7551')">2:05:51</a> it is not bus allegedly that a lot which  
<a onclick="modifyYTiframeseektime('7554')">2:05:54</a> is mentioned  
<a onclick="modifyYTiframeseektime('7555')">2:05:55</a> is a man who used to be doing elect  
<a onclick="modifyYTiframeseektime('7559')">2:05:59</a> kneeing the door and making like like a  
<a onclick="modifyYTiframeseektime('7562')">2:06:02</a> sweet or some dish and giving it to the  
<a onclick="modifyYTiframeseektime('7564')">2:06:04</a> whole Jazz for free and then The Story  
<a onclick="modifyYTiframeseektime('7566')">2:06:06</a> Goes that that after he died they  
<a onclick="modifyYTiframeseektime('7569')">2:06:09</a> honored his grave  
<a onclick="modifyYTiframeseektime('7571')">2:06:11</a> but according to the Quran  
<a onclick="modifyYTiframeseektime('7575')">2:06:15</a> to say that even if it rabba said that  
<a onclick="modifyYTiframeseektime('7577')">2:06:17</a> relying on some mythical stories of the  
<a onclick="modifyYTiframeseektime('7579')">2:06:19</a> Arabic the Quran says clearly  
<a onclick="modifyYTiframeseektime('7585')">2:06:25</a> from beginning with the end discuss  
<a onclick="modifyYTiframeseektime('7587')">2:06:27</a> various issues and then comes to Allah  
<a onclick="modifyYTiframeseektime('7589')">2:06:29</a> Allah are female deities and the Quran  
<a onclick="modifyYTiframeseektime('7593')">2:06:33</a> is clearly from the beginning to end  
<a onclick="modifyYTiframeseektime('7595')">2:06:35</a> nothing is female in that Surah  
<a onclick="modifyYTiframeseektime('7598')">2:06:38</a> except Allah all these females and the  
<a onclick="modifyYTiframeseektime('7601')">2:06:41</a> female deities clearly  
<a onclick="modifyYTiframeseektime('7604')">2:06:44</a> and they are supposed to be the the  
<a onclick="modifyYTiframeseektime('7606')">2:06:46</a> consort on the the the offsprings the  
<a onclick="modifyYTiframeseektime('7609')">2:06:49</a> the daughters of Allah  
<a onclick="modifyYTiframeseektime('7611')">2:06:51</a> ascribe daughters to Allah female why do  
<a onclick="modifyYTiframeseektime('7614')">2:06:54</a> you don't like female girls  
<a onclick="modifyYTiframeseektime('7615')">2:06:55</a> come why is Allah supposed to have  
<a onclick="modifyYTiframeseektime('7618')">2:06:58</a> daughters and you are do not like  
<a onclick="modifyYTiframeseektime('7619')">2:06:59</a> daughters  
<a onclick="modifyYTiframeseektime('7620')">2:07:00</a> and the Quran rebook that in other

<a onclick="modifyYTiframeseektime('7624')">2:07:04</a> something female a female deity  
<a onclick="modifyYTiframeseektime('7627')">2:07:07</a> so they took that 40 narration which is  
<a onclick="modifyYTiframeseektime('7629')">2:07:09</a> not a Hadith from it who could being  
<a onclick="modifyYTiframeseektime('7632')">2:07:12</a> wrong could believe this mythical

<a onclick="modifyYTiframeseektime('7642')">2:07:22</a> structurally give the Quran Islam on the

<a onclick="modifyYTiframeseektime('8443')">2:20:43</a> also a selfie in that sense and the  
<a onclick="modifyYTiframeseektime('8445')">2:20:45</a> magically in that sense because he told

<a onclick="modifyYTiframeseektime('8471')">2:21:11</a> um I'm an amount of security and that's  
<a onclick="modifyYTiframeseektime('8473')">2:21:13</a> all what counts and the kingdom of

<a onclick="modifyYTiframeseektime('8479')">2:21:19</a> not here there's no Kingdom of Christ  
<a onclick="modifyYTiframeseektime('8480')">2:21:20</a> here  
<a onclick="modifyYTiframeseektime('8481')">2:21:21</a> because Christ has has announced the  
<a onclick="modifyYTiframeseektime('8484')">2:21:24</a> kingdom the whole book is about the  
<a onclick="modifyYTiframeseektime('8486')">2:21:26</a> gospel is saying about announcing the  
<a onclick="modifyYTiframeseektime('8489')">2:21:29</a> kingdom the kingdom is near and so on  
<a onclick="modifyYTiframeseektime('8491')">2:21:31</a> and the interpreted kingdom is  
<a onclick="modifyYTiframeseektime('8492')">2:21:32</a> Otherworld reality the kingdom let me  
<a onclick="modifyYTiframeseektime('8494')">2:21:34</a> give you an interpretation and people  
<a onclick="modifyYTiframeseektime('8495')">2:21:35</a> may think about it the other side issue  
<a onclick="modifyYTiframeseektime('8498')">2:21:38</a> as an important issue the kingdom he's  
<a onclick="modifyYTiframeseektime('8500')">2:21:40</a> announced is essentially announcing  
<a onclick="modifyYTiframeseektime('8501')">2:21:41</a> Muhammad or the Sharia will be  
<a onclick="modifyYTiframeseektime('8503')">2:21:43</a> established and we will have will have  
<a onclick="modifyYTiframeseektime('8505')">2:21:45</a> systems  
<a onclick="modifyYTiframeseektime('8506')">2:21:46</a> essentially so the kingdom of God will  
<a onclick="modifyYTiframeseektime('8509')">2:21:49</a> be on earth  
<a onclick="modifyYTiframeseektime('8510')">2:21:50</a> the kingdom of the other word is  
<a onclick="modifyYTiframeseektime('8512')">2:21:52</a> something yes it's not this word  
<a onclick="modifyYTiframeseektime('8514')">2:21:54</a> but anyways of that that's the sport so  
<a onclick="modifyYTiframeseektime('8517')">2:21:57</a> there are probably in Muslims like like  
<a onclick="modifyYTiframeseektime('8520')">2:22:00</a> a deviant and  
<a onclick="modifyYTiframeseektime('8522')">2:22:02</a> Christianity which the only one survived  
<a onclick="modifyYTiframeseektime('8525')">2:22:05</a> since the third century reportage is or  
<a onclick="modifyYTiframeseektime('8528')">2:22:08</a> even second century is is utter  
<a onclick="modifyYTiframeseektime('8530')">2:22:10</a> deviation  
<a onclick="modifyYTiframeseektime('8532')">2:22:12</a> and that is connected with attributing  
<a onclick="modifyYTiframeseektime('8534')">2:22:14</a> divinity to Christ and things like that  
<a onclick="modifyYTiframeseektime('8536')">2:22:16</a> which attacks our people more attention  
<a onclick="modifyYTiframeseektime('8538')">2:22:18</a> but the reality the catastrophe happens  
<a onclick="modifyYTiframeseektime('8539')">2:22:19</a> with this statement  
<a onclick="modifyYTiframeseektime('8541')">2:22:21</a> that the kingdom colleges otherworldly  
<a onclick="modifyYTiframeseektime('8543')">2:22:23</a> that the emperor Rules by by Allah's  
<a onclick="modifyYTiframeseektime('8545')">2:22:25</a> permission even is only the creative  
<a onclick="modifyYTiframeseektime('8547')">2:22:27</a> permission nobody should Rebel you  
<a onclick="modifyYTiframeseektime('8549')">2:22:29</a> should submit should obey and listen  
<a onclick="modifyYTiframeseektime('8551')">2:22:31</a> that's exactly probably in Christianity  
<a onclick="modifyYTiframeseektime('8554')">2:22:34</a> is just like an icing on the cake  
<a onclick="modifyYTiframeseektime('8557')">2:22:37</a> actually  
<a onclick="modifyYTiframeseektime('8558')">2:22:38</a> in that example you gave him Abdullah  
<a onclick="modifyYTiframeseektime('8560')">2:22:40</a> when he uh had that interaction with  
<a onclick="modifyYTiframeseektime('8562')">2:22:42</a> with Saud and he's and just the fact  
<a onclick="modifyYTiframeseektime('8566')">2:22:46</a> that he was prepared to relegate issues  
<a onclick="modifyYTiframeseektime('8569')">2:22:49</a> of a person legislate more oppressing or  
<a onclick="modifyYTiframeseektime('8572')">2:22:52</a> taking tax and just considering it not a  
<a onclick="modifyYTiframeseektime('8574')">2:22:54</a> big deal is another early indicator of  
<a onclick="modifyYTiframeseektime('8576')">2:22:56</a> this kind of hierarchy that they said  
<a onclick="modifyYTiframeseektime('8578')">2:22:58</a> the motivation is he said as long as you  
<a onclick="modifyYTiframeseektime('8582')">2:23:02</a> support me for the for for tahit he was  
<a onclick="modifyYTiframeseektime('8585')">2:23:05</a> so obsessed that he's blinded of that  
<a onclick="modifyYTiframeseektime('8587')">2:23:07</a> that's not the same like  
<a onclick="modifyYTiframeseektime('8588')">2:23:08</a> systematically and theoretically and  
<a onclick="modifyYTiframeseektime('8591')">2:23:11</a> found it as a structured argument in  
<a onclick="modifyYTiframeseektime('8593')">2:23:13</a> books and publications  
<a onclick="modifyYTiframeseektime('8595')">2:23:15</a> they they are acting like the yahoots  
<a onclick="modifyYTiframeseektime('8597')">2:23:17</a> they are clearly when you say the  
<a onclick="modifyYTiframeseektime('8599')">2:23:19</a> evidence is completely blind say oh this  
<a onclick="modifyYTiframeseektime('8602')">2:23:22</a> is the sin and so on okay and another  
<a onclick="modifyYTiframeseektime('8604')">2:23:24</a> another  
<a onclick="modifyYTiframeseektime('8607')">2:23:27</a> in the future you will be the taxes I  
<a onclick="modifyYTiframeseektime('8609')">2:23:29</a> think it's fabricated this Edition but  
<a onclick="modifyYTiframeseektime('8611')">2:23:31</a> maybe that's what he came in his mind  
<a onclick="modifyYTiframeseektime('8612')">2:23:32</a> and the other writer  
<a onclick="modifyYTiframeseektime('8614')">2:23:34</a> gets what is his mind whatever  
<a onclick="modifyYTiframeseektime('8616')">2:23:36</a> justification is just because of the  
<a onclick="modifyYTiframeseektime('8618')">2:23:38</a> blinding of opposition that's different  
<a onclick="modifyYTiframeseektime('8620')">2:23:40</a> than astruction Theory represented for  
<a onclick="modifyYTiframeseektime('8625')">2:23:45</a> example one recent guy of them  
<a onclick="modifyYTiframeseektime('8627')">2:23:47</a> foreign

<a onclick="modifyYTiframeseektime('8658')">2:24:18</a> to clarify what we said about the

<a onclick="modifyYTiframeseektime('8783')">2:26:23</a> because they dead legislate for

<a onclick="modifyYTiframeseektime('8795')">2:26:35</a> not mention any

<a onclick="modifyYTiframeseektime('8802')">2:26:42</a> when I noticed this thing a few years  
<a onclick="modifyYTiframeseektime('8804')">2:26:44</a> ago so I said maybe I'm mistaken so let  
<a onclick="modifyYTiframeseektime('8807')">2:26:47</a> me say I had it nothing about the Hadith  
<a onclick="modifyYTiframeseektime('8809')">2:26:49</a> story let me check the Old Testament it  
<a onclick="modifyYTiframeseektime('8813')">2:26:53</a> may be part of it to be fabricated but  
<a onclick="modifyYTiframeseektime('8815')">2:26:55</a> at least the core of the story may be

<a onclick="modifyYTiframeseektime('8820')">2:27:00</a> the people of lot  
<a onclick="modifyYTiframeseektime('8821')">2:27:01</a> no Idols nothing absolutely nothing only  
<a onclick="modifyYTiframeseektime('8824')">2:27:04</a> legislating that's what they desire  
<a onclick="modifyYTiframeseektime('8826')">2:27:06</a> undermining hakimia  
<a onclick="modifyYTiframeseektime('8829')">2:27:09</a> and there we speak English and they have

<a onclick="modifyYTiframeseektime('9698')">2:41:38</a> fabrication  
<a onclick="modifyYTiframeseektime('9701')">2:41:41</a> so this is genuinely attributed to

<a onclick="modifyYTiframeseektime('9728')">2:42:08</a> audacity with the one who fabricated  
<a onclick="modifyYTiframeseektime('9730')">2:42:10</a> this Hadith because  
<a onclick="modifyYTiframeseektime('9732')">2:42:12</a> you meet Allah

<a onclick="modifyYTiframeseektime('9755')">2:42:35</a> that's a blatant cover the fabrication  
<a onclick="modifyYTiframeseektime('9759')">2:42:39</a> so we have that also because if you say

<a onclick="modifyYTiframeseektime('9790')">2:43:10</a> or cut part of the context then you have  
<a onclick="modifyYTiframeseektime('9793')">2:43:13</a> Twisted the meaning  
<a onclick="modifyYTiframeseektime('9804')">2:43:24</a> both even in simple verbs and sentences

<a onclick="modifyYTiframeseektime('9809')">2:43:29</a> something also contest and change the  
<a onclick="modifyYTiframeseektime('9811')">2:43:31</a> wording  
<a onclick="modifyYTiframeseektime('9812')">2:43:32</a> give me things that that's the declaring  
<a onclick="modifyYTiframeseektime('9814')">2:43:34</a> these things which are not maybe they

<a onclick="modifyYTiframeseektime('9852')">2:44:12</a> exactly so  
<a onclick="modifyYTiframeseektime('9854')">2:44:14</a> so that's that's they have this we have  
<a onclick="modifyYTiframeseektime('9856')">2:44:16</a> these all these characters  
<a onclick="modifyYTiframeseektime('9858')">2:44:18</a> from that  
<a onclick="modifyYTiframeseektime('9860')">2:44:20</a> he won't you never films that Hadith you  
<a onclick="modifyYTiframeseektime('9862')">2:44:22</a> will follow the the methods of the  
<a onclick="modifyYTiframeseektime('9864')">2:44:24</a> previous people even if they go in the  
<a onclick="modifyYTiframeseektime('9866')">2:44:26</a> lizard hall and then another narration  
<a onclick="modifyYTiframeseektime('9868')">2:44:28</a> is nice reminisce by the way  
<a onclick="modifyYTiframeseektime('9872')">2:44:32</a> another one even if one of them have  
<a onclick="modifyYTiframeseektime('9874')">2:44:34</a> ornicated his mother publicly you  
<a onclick="modifyYTiframeseektime('9877')">2:44:37</a> someone of you will be doing that so  
<a onclick="modifyYTiframeseektime('9879')">2:44:39</a> mention  
<a onclick="modifyYTiframeseektime('9880')">2:44:40</a> the extent but he mentioned  
<a onclick="modifyYTiframeseektime('9883')">2:44:43</a> is Visual and extreme so that everyone  
<a onclick="modifyYTiframeseektime('9885')">2:44:45</a> understand even the symbols between they  
<a onclick="modifyYTiframeseektime('9887')">2:44:47</a> would not have said if they would have  
<a onclick="modifyYTiframeseektime('9889')">2:44:49</a> changed the Quran or changed words and  
<a onclick="modifyYTiframeseektime('9891')">2:44:51</a> so on That's So too sophisticated but  
<a onclick="modifyYTiframeseektime('9893')">2:44:53</a> there's example is clear if someone even  
<a onclick="modifyYTiframeseektime('9896')">2:44:56</a> committed Zina with his mother publicly  
<a onclick="modifyYTiframeseektime('9899')">2:44:59</a> someone of you will do the same you will  
<a onclick="modifyYTiframeseektime('9900')">2:45:00</a> follow them  
<a onclick="modifyYTiframeseektime('9902')">2:45:02</a> say yes in another narration he  
<a onclick="modifyYTiframeseektime('9905')">2:45:05</a> mentioned president and the Romans most  
<a onclick="modifyYTiframeseektime('9907')">2:45:07</a> like in matter of statecraft are running  
<a onclick="modifyYTiframeseektime('9909')">2:45:09</a> the state  
<a onclick="modifyYTiframeseektime('9911')">2:45:11</a> just to tell the future no to warn  
<a onclick="modifyYTiframeseektime('9915')">2:45:15</a> blade don't follow their ways  
<a onclick="modifyYTiframeseektime('9918')">2:45:18</a> keep distance keep  
<a onclick="modifyYTiframeseektime('9921')">2:45:21</a> watching cautiously and ridiculously  
<a onclick="modifyYTiframeseektime('9924')">2:45:24</a> don't fall in these traps  
<a onclick="modifyYTiframeseektime('9926')">2:45:26</a> but the people decided to not listen  
<a onclick="modifyYTiframeseektime('9930')">2:45:30</a> unfortunately because this is a domain  
<a onclick="modifyYTiframeseektime('9933')">2:45:33</a> of testing  
<a onclick="modifyYTiframeseektime('9935')">2:45:35</a> but does not justify that even instant  
<a onclick="modifyYTiframeseektime('9939')">2:45:39</a> we ought not have done that and you will  
<a onclick="modifyYTiframeseektime('9941')">2:45:41</a> be asked for that and you'll be  
<a onclick="modifyYTiframeseektime('9942')">2:45:42</a> accounted for that  
<a onclick="modifyYTiframeseektime('9946')">2:45:46</a> so it's really almost like the Jews and  
<a onclick="modifyYTiframeseektime('9948')">2:45:48</a> also in other aspect like faculty  
<a onclick="modifyYTiframeseektime('9951')">2:45:51</a> going extreme and piety abstaining upon  
<a onclick="modifyYTiframeseektime('9954')">2:45:54</a> things which is just fearful and so on  
<a onclick="modifyYTiframeseektime('9958')">2:45:58</a> creating things without evidence and so  
<a onclick="modifyYTiframeseektime('9960')">2:46:00</a> on calling it being prior to you  
<a onclick="modifyYTiframeseektime('9964')">2:46:04</a> avoid this this is suspicious this is  
<a onclick="modifyYTiframeseektime('9966')">2:46:06</a> suspicion yes if you don't know about  
<a onclick="modifyYTiframeseektime('9967')">2:46:07</a> something that's suspicious  
<a onclick="modifyYTiframeseektime('9969')">2:46:09</a> but you have no certitude yes but in  
<a onclick="modifyYTiframeseektime('9972')">2:46:12</a> itself there's nothing an unknown  
<a onclick="modifyYTiframeseektime('9978')">2:46:18</a> maybe for an individual like the Hadith  
<a onclick="modifyYTiframeseektime('9980')">2:46:20</a> famous Hadith  
<a onclick="modifyYTiframeseektime('9981')">2:46:21</a> and this is between things which may be  
<a onclick="modifyYTiframeseektime('9984')">2:46:24</a> confusing for certain people if it's  
<a onclick="modifyYTiframeseektime('9986')">2:46:26</a> conclusion for you then avoid it but

<a onclick="modifyYTiframeseektime('10211')">2:50:11</a> the way I thought at the time that the

<a onclick="modifyYTiframeseektime('10702')">2:58:22</a> like a great spirit of like the we see

<a onclick="modifyYTiframeseektime('10726')">2:58:46</a> media experience but there's some some  
<a onclick="modifyYTiframeseektime('10728')">2:58:48</a> overwhelming Universal spirit  
<a onclick="modifyYTiframeseektime('10730')">2:58:50</a> and there's no other one that's it  
<a onclick="modifyYTiframeseektime('10732')">2:58:52</a> that's all the way and they attribute  
<a onclick="modifyYTiframeseektime('10734')">2:58:54</a> that to him that's the worship October  
<a onclick="modifyYTiframeseektime('10735')">2:58:55</a> so he's perfectly washable  
<a onclick="modifyYTiframeseektime('10739')">2:58:59</a> and has no other acts to do except that  
<a onclick="modifyYTiframeseektime('10742')">2:59:02</a> one  
<a onclick="modifyYTiframeseektime('10742')">2:59:02</a> that's all that ini has at this time  
<a onclick="modifyYTiframeseektime('10745')">2:59:05</a> okay I think we overloaded that is none  
<a onclick="modifyYTiframeseektime('10748')">2:59:08</a> and then we'll come back shall see what  
<a onclick="modifyYTiframeseektime('10749')">2:59:09</a> people will come with and I hope we'll  
<a onclick="modifyYTiframeseektime('10752')">2:59:12</a> see what will be the reaction which  
<a onclick="modifyYTiframeseektime('10753')">2:59:13</a> questions will come and we address them  
<a onclick="modifyYTiframeseektime('10757')">2:59:17</a> and that was supposedly you will have  
<a onclick="modifyYTiframeseektime('10758')">2:59:18</a> done based on the question if we get  
<a onclick="modifyYTiframeseektime('10760')">2:59:20</a> them early enough with what then I can't  
<a onclick="modifyYTiframeseektime('10762')">2:59:22</a> give him Hadith about how to deal with  
<a onclick="modifyYTiframeseektime('10764')">2:59:24</a> the rulers and so on like in the Arabic  
<a onclick="modifyYTiframeseektime('10767')">2:59:27</a> version of black Arctic the rulers we  
<a onclick="modifyYTiframeseektime('10768')">2:59:28</a> don't have it in English yet I think  
<a onclick="modifyYTiframeseektime('10770')">2:59:30</a> said we did not start a translation  
<a onclick="modifyYTiframeseektime('10771')">2:59:31</a> unfortunately I can summarize some of  
<a onclick="modifyYTiframeseektime('10775')">2:59:35</a> them and give you how many it's not are  
<a onclick="modifyYTiframeseektime('10777')">2:59:37</a> there just this number I will not read  
<a onclick="modifyYTiframeseektime('10779')">2:59:39</a> that because this will be volume this  
<a onclick="modifyYTiframeseektime('10780')">2:59:40</a> will feel easily a a reasonable size  
<a onclick="modifyYTiframeseektime('10783')">2:59:43</a> volume I'll just give you that as a  
<a onclick="modifyYTiframeseektime('10785')">2:59:45</a> complete is it is there is your draft

<a onclick="modifyYTiframeseektime('10794')">2:59:54</a> improving it and updating it  
<a onclick="modifyYTiframeseektime('10796')">2:59:56</a> yeah there's no there's no translations  
<a onclick="modifyYTiframeseektime('10798')">2:59:58</a> for that at the moment I said to the  
<a onclick="modifyYTiframeseektime('10801')">3:00:01</a> translate to hold back because I think  
<a onclick="modifyYTiframeseektime('10803')">3:00:03</a> we can do more substantial rearrangement  
<a onclick="modifyYTiframeseektime('10805')">3:00:05</a> and Improvement and better study  
<a onclick="modifyYTiframeseektime('10807')">3:00:07</a> obviousness

<a onclick="modifyYTiframeseektime('10821')">3:00:21</a> but we discussed more slowly Things  
<a onclick="modifyYTiframeseektime('10822')">3:00:22</a> become much sharper and would be more
