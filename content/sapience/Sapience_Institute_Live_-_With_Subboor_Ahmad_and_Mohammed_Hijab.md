### [00:00:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iyWFulQ7apg&t=0) - [01:00:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iyWFulQ7apg&t=3600)

The Sapience Institute holds a live stream in which they discuss various misconceptions about Islam. They argue that some of the miracles in the Quran are metaphysical, and that it is unscientific to believe in Islam. They also discuss the Flat argument, and how it is a fallacy of equivocation. In conclusion, they submit to the commands of Allah and follow His interpretation of equality.

**[00:00:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iyWFulQ7apg&t=0)** The Sapience Institute is hosting a live session in which they will be discussing what they think are the most important theological and philosophical issues for the art today. They will be discussing the philosophical and theological approach to answering misconceptions about Islam and discussing how to make a case for Islam.
* **[00:05:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iyWFulQ7apg&t=300)** The Sapience Institute discusses why there is a problem with the scientific miracles narrative and how it threatens Christianity and Islam. They also mention how the problem is that morality is being neglected in favor of pursuing scientific knowledge.
* **[00:10:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iyWFulQ7apg&t=600)** The Sapience Institute is a research-oriented think tank focused on Islamic morality and ethics. They state that philosophy is a critical tool in countering liberal ideologies, and that Western philosophers have been using philosophy to undermine Islam. They also state that philosophy can be used to undermine liberal values, and that it is important to define what philosophy is before addressing the elephant in the room - the prohibition of using philosophy to refute religious ideas.
* **[00:15:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iyWFulQ7apg&t=900)* Discusses how one must be strategic in order to engage in dawah, or Islamic missionary work, successfully. He points out that there is a gap between those who are older and have more experience, and those who are more grassroots and less experienced. He says that those who are more grassroots need to be taught how to deal philosophically with people who oppose Islam, and that doing so requires feeling the pain of being affected by atheistic narratives.
* **[00:20:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iyWFulQ7apg&t=1200)* Discusses the perspective of a muslim who believes that the Earth is flat according to the Quran. It also discusses the perspective of atheists, who use this perspective as an argument against muslims. Sapience Institute is working on a library of resources that will refute these arguments.
* **[00:25:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iyWFulQ7apg&t=1500)* Discusses how some Muslims believe that the sun, stars, and planets are shooting at devils, and how this is unscientific. says that the answer exposes the questioner's lack of understanding when it comes to logic and science.
* **[00:30:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iyWFulQ7apg&t=1800)** The Sapience Institute is hosting a live stream with Mohamad Hijab and Subboor Ahmad to discuss the many misconceptions about Islam. Ahmad argues that because some of the miracles in the Quran are metaphysical, it is unscientific to believe in Islam. Hijab counters that because the Quran is clear about its teachings, it is beyond science.
* **[00:35:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iyWFulQ7apg&t=2100)* Discusses the idea that there is no evidence that the splitting of the moon happened, and asks Muhammad Hijab and Subboor Ahmad how they would go about confirming it if it did.
* **[00:40:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iyWFulQ7apg&t=2400)** The Sapience Institute discusses the Flat argument, which states that if something was seen in the sky by a large number of people, it must be from God.  points out that there are many arguments that can be made for God, but the cosmological argument is not one of them.
* **[00:45:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iyWFulQ7apg&t=2700)* Discusses the difference between atheists and believers in regards to their understanding of the concept of "nothing." Atheists believe that something can come from nothing, while believers believe that nothing exists. asserts that this argument is a fallacy of equivocation because what "nothing" means to the atheists is not the same as what "nothing" means to the believers.
* **[00:50:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iyWFulQ7apg&t=3000)* Discusses the objection to the existence of meaning in the universe raised by quantum characters. He explains that this objection is an assertion rather than an argument, and that there is no evidence for it. He goes on to say that if meaning is something which is purely environmental, then natural selection cannot account for it. He asks the audience to remember the way evolution works, and points out that if meaning is something which develops due to the environment, then it would not be stable over long periods of time. He concludes by asking the audience to dismiss the assertion without evidence.
* **[00:55:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iyWFulQ7apg&t=3300)* Discusses how equality is different between men and women and how feminism and egalitarianism are at odds with each other. He argues that we should submit to the commands of Allah and follow His interpretation of equality.
### [01:00:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iyWFulQ7apg&t=3600) - [02:00:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iyWFulQ7apg&t=7200)

In the "Sapience Institute Live" video, Subboor Ahmad and Mohammed Hijab discuss a variety of topics related to Islam. They discuss the inconsistency of the Quran, the concept of deism, and the existence of Adam. They also answer questions from viewers about these topics.

**[01:00:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iyWFulQ7apg&t=3600)* Discusses the inconsistency of the Quran, specifically pointing out that certain verses allow for certain religious groups to be married, while others do not. He also discusses the terms 'contradiction' and 'inconsistency.'
* **[01:05:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iyWFulQ7apg&t=3900)* Discusses two texts from the hadith which leave him with questions. The first text states that Adam was created 60 cubits tall, and the second text describes the amount of time between prophets. He finds this to be confusing when looking at human history from a scientific perspective. He wants to write about this in more detail, but doesn't have the time right now.
* **[01:10:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iyWFulQ7apg&t=4200)** Sapience Institute Live speaker Subboor Ahmad discusses the possible existence of a "ruaya" or miracle that created humans from clay and made them able to fly. He points to a hadith which discusses Noah's creation of a living bird from clay. If this hadith is true, it would support the idea that humans were spontaneously created by Allah.
* **[01:15:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iyWFulQ7apg&t=4500)* Discusses the evidence for the existence of Adam and how this evidence is not just based on evidence, but includes a priori philosophical beliefs. He then goes on to talk about a different topic.
* **[01:20:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iyWFulQ7apg&t=4800)* Discusses the rarity of fossilization and the fact that even if fossils were to be found, they would not provide evidence for the age of Noah.  also discusses how the Quran mentions that Noah's followers would not give birth to other people.
* **[01:25:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iyWFulQ7apg&t=5100)** The Sapience Institute Live video featuring Subboor Ahmad and Mohammed Hijab discusses the idea of more than two genders, and how to disprove it according to Islamic principles. Ahmad argues that if everything is socially constructed, then race does not exist, and thus there is no such thing as racism. Hijab discusses how her peers in the gender studies department agreed with her belief that penis is a social construction. Craig makes a video discussing why he thinks the Muslim concept of God fails. He argues that the idea of a god who is all-powerful and all-knowing is incompatible with the scientific understanding of the world.
* **[01:30:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iyWFulQ7apg&t=5400)** Subboor Ahmad and Mohammed Hijab discuss the concept of god in Islam and how it differs from the concept of god in Christianity. They also discuss how the recent pandemic has changed some people's views on religion.
* **[01:35:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iyWFulQ7apg&t=5700)* Discusses some doubts that they have about Islam and how to apply principles such as following the scholars and consensus to other aspects of life. They mention that a question for Hijab, who is a scholar on the topic, would be how children from Adam al-Islam (a.k.a. the Prophet Muhammad) reproduced. also mentions that this is a common interpretation among Muslim scholars.
* **[01:40:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iyWFulQ7apg&t=6000)** The Sapience Institute is broadcasting a live stream with Subboor Ahmad and Mohammed Hijab. Ahmad asks a question, and Hijab responds. The next caller, honey, has a question about following the school of thought, not about religious doubts. Jawad joins the discussion, and Stanely asks a question. Ahmad responds, and Hijab kicks Stanley out of the room.
* **[01:45:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iyWFulQ7apg&t=6300)** argues that because the Quran speaks about naturalistic phenomena, it is a miracle. goes on to say that while other ancient texts do not have this privilege, islam is unique in that it has a precedent for interpreting the Quran in a way that is concurrent with 21st century cosmological understandings.
* **[01:50:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iyWFulQ7apg&t=6600)** tells the audience that he has found two good arguments against deism, one from a Muslim perspective and one from a Christian perspective. He recommends that anyone interested in the topic read Bassam Zawadi's article on deism.
* **[01:55:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iyWFulQ7apg&t=6900)* Discusses the concept of deism, which is the belief that God created the world and left it to run on its own. argues that deism is not a consistent belief because it would mean that God is doing something superfluous that has no meaning or purpose. also argues that the verses of the Quran support the idea that God is always involved in the running of the universe, which makes deism untenable.
### [02:00:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iyWFulQ7apg&t=7200) - [02:30:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iyWFulQ7apg&t=9000)

the panelists discuss the history of evolution and the role of Muslim scholars in this field. They also discuss the idea that non-collaborative manuscripts with pictures on them can have errors. Finally, they discuss the question of whether or not things that are measured to be the same are, in fact, the same ontologically.

**[02:00:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iyWFulQ7apg&t=7200)* Discusses the concepts of isosceles and its conceptions, and how they have changed dramatically over the past hundred years. He goes on to say that we don't know what would happen if mountains were taken out of their place, and that this is why the quranic consumption talks about instability if you uproot a mountain.
* **[02:05:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iyWFulQ7apg&t=7500)** Sapien Institute Live panelists discuss the harm principle and how it applies to issues such as sexual molestation. If an atheist bases their morality on the harm principle, they would not condone such behavior, even if it is in contradiction to scripture.
* **[02:10:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iyWFulQ7apg&t=7800)* Discusses different aspects of the Islamic law, or Sharia, and how it differs from the biblical law. He points out that, although all of Allah's laws are the same, there may be certain situations where one law would be more appropriate than the other. He also notes that, while the principle of infallibility is important in relation to prophets, it is not the only principle that determines whether something is an injustice.
* **[02:15:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iyWFulQ7apg&t=8100)* Discusses the importance of combining educational resources from different sources, such as books, lectures, and online videos. They also mention the importance of engaging with an audience and being open to learning from different perspectives.
* **[02:20:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iyWFulQ7apg&t=8400)* Discusses the history of evolution and the role of Muslim scholars in this field. Professor Malik's paper refuting the argument that Muslim scientists developed Darwinism before his work was published is discussed.
* **[02:25:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iyWFulQ7apg&t=8700)** Cambridge University professors discuss the idea that non-collaborative manuscripts with pictures on them can have errors. One professor mentions a book of animals and says that Schweib's contributions to biology are good, but he has made mistakes in translating Arabic texts. Another professor says that all human beings die, but the bodies of prophets do not decompose.
* **[02:30:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iyWFulQ7apg&t=9000)** The Sapience Institute live stream discussed the question of whether or not things that are measured to be the same are, in fact, the same ontologically. The discussion focused on how human imperfection can cause things to be different, but pointed out that Allah is the best of creators and that even with human error, things would be the same if Allah were involved.

[0:01:05](https://youtu.be/iyWFulQ7apg?t=65) such as um

[0:01:19](https://youtu.be/iyWFulQ7apg?t=79) things so before we get into it  
[0:01:21](https://youtu.be/iyWFulQ7apg?t=81) um we're actually having a few people  
[0:01:23](https://youtu.be/iyWFulQ7apg?t=83) joining us now which is martial

[0:01:33](https://youtu.be/iyWFulQ7apg?t=93) time does it take to actually produce

[0:01:37](https://youtu.be/iyWFulQ7apg?t=97) produced like every day it takes a bit  
[0:01:39](https://youtu.be/iyWFulQ7apg?t=99) of time and  
[0:01:40](https://youtu.be/iyWFulQ7apg?t=100) what sort of process do you go through  
[0:01:42](https://youtu.be/iyWFulQ7apg?t=102) to actually develop this type of content  
[0:01:45](https://youtu.be/iyWFulQ7apg?t=105) well you know recipients thoughts the  
[0:01:47](https://youtu.be/iyWFulQ7apg?t=107) idea what what i'm trying to do with it  
[0:01:49](https://youtu.be/iyWFulQ7apg?t=109) because obviously it's more than just me  
[0:01:51](https://youtu.be/iyWFulQ7apg?t=111) it's  
[0:01:52](https://youtu.be/iyWFulQ7apg?t=112) you're involved and hussein's involved  
[0:01:54](https://youtu.be/iyWFulQ7apg?t=114) um  
[0:01:55](https://youtu.be/iyWFulQ7apg?t=115) professor othman aldiva's involved many  
[0:01:58](https://youtu.be/iyWFulQ7apg?t=118) and obviously hamster sources  
[0:01:59](https://youtu.be/iyWFulQ7apg?t=119) so we're all kind of involved in this  
[0:02:00](https://youtu.be/iyWFulQ7apg?t=120) project and what  
[0:02:03](https://youtu.be/iyWFulQ7apg?t=123) my end of it is what i'm dealing with  
[0:02:05](https://youtu.be/iyWFulQ7apg?t=125) personally is  
[0:02:07](https://youtu.be/iyWFulQ7apg?t=127) are the contentions so we're dealing  
[0:02:09](https://youtu.be/iyWFulQ7apg?t=129) with we're starting with  
[0:02:11](https://youtu.be/iyWFulQ7apg?t=131) uh we're trying to have a portfolio or a  
[0:02:13](https://youtu.be/iyWFulQ7apg?t=133) database  
[0:02:15](https://youtu.be/iyWFulQ7apg?t=135) of contentions answered so we're  
[0:02:17](https://youtu.be/iyWFulQ7apg?t=137) starting with  
[0:02:18](https://youtu.be/iyWFulQ7apg?t=138) the supposed or so-called scientific  
[0:02:22](https://youtu.be/iyWFulQ7apg?t=142) error narrative  
[0:02:23](https://youtu.be/iyWFulQ7apg?t=143) yeah and uh we filmed practically almost  
[0:02:26](https://youtu.be/iyWFulQ7apg?t=146) all of the major contentions that we've  
[0:02:27](https://youtu.be/iyWFulQ7apg?t=147) seen online  
[0:02:29](https://youtu.be/iyWFulQ7apg?t=149) some of them don't need to be answered  
[0:02:30](https://youtu.be/iyWFulQ7apg?t=150) because quite frankly  
[0:02:32](https://youtu.be/iyWFulQ7apg?t=152) not many people are asking those  
[0:02:33](https://youtu.be/iyWFulQ7apg?t=153) questions and  
[0:02:36](https://youtu.be/iyWFulQ7apg?t=156) there's almost nothing there like in  
[0:02:37](https://youtu.be/iyWFulQ7apg?t=157) terms of contention but with the main  
[0:02:39](https://youtu.be/iyWFulQ7apg?t=159) questions  
[0:02:41](https://youtu.be/iyWFulQ7apg?t=161) and we're starting with that and that  
[0:02:44](https://youtu.be/iyWFulQ7apg?t=164) gives us an opportunity to talk about  
[0:02:45](https://youtu.be/iyWFulQ7apg?t=165) the approach as well like the exegetical  
[0:02:47](https://youtu.be/iyWFulQ7apg?t=167) approach  
[0:02:48](https://youtu.be/iyWFulQ7apg?t=168) principles to lay down some principles  
[0:02:49](https://youtu.be/iyWFulQ7apg?t=169) how people can  
[0:02:51](https://youtu.be/iyWFulQ7apg?t=171) uh safeguard themselves from should we  
[0:02:53](https://youtu.be/iyWFulQ7apg?t=173) have from doubts and also  
[0:02:54](https://youtu.be/iyWFulQ7apg?t=174) how to uh empowers people to be able to  
[0:02:57](https://youtu.be/iyWFulQ7apg?t=177) answer questions  
[0:02:58](https://youtu.be/iyWFulQ7apg?t=178) yeah you know to their colleagues  
[0:03:00](https://youtu.be/iyWFulQ7apg?t=180) co-workers uh  
[0:03:02](https://youtu.be/iyWFulQ7apg?t=182) family members or friends or whatever it  
[0:03:04](https://youtu.be/iyWFulQ7apg?t=184) may be  
[0:03:05](https://youtu.be/iyWFulQ7apg?t=185) so we're going to move on to different  
[0:03:06](https://youtu.be/iyWFulQ7apg?t=186) kinds of contention uh after we've done  
[0:03:08](https://youtu.be/iyWFulQ7apg?t=188) the scientific era stuff  
[0:03:10](https://youtu.be/iyWFulQ7apg?t=190) uh supposed contradictions historical  
[0:03:13](https://youtu.be/iyWFulQ7apg?t=193) issues and so on  
[0:03:14](https://youtu.be/iyWFulQ7apg?t=194) and once all the con the major  
[0:03:15](https://youtu.be/iyWFulQ7apg?t=195) contentions are done  
[0:03:17](https://youtu.be/iyWFulQ7apg?t=197) uh even the moral stuff like you know  
[0:03:19](https://youtu.be/iyWFulQ7apg?t=199) women's rights and uh  
[0:03:21](https://youtu.be/iyWFulQ7apg?t=201) also questions about the hadood and all  
[0:03:24](https://youtu.be/iyWFulQ7apg?t=204) of that kind of thing  
[0:03:26](https://youtu.be/iyWFulQ7apg?t=206) once all of that is done then we can  
[0:03:29](https://youtu.be/iyWFulQ7apg?t=209) move on to well from my side of it  
[0:03:31](https://youtu.be/iyWFulQ7apg?t=211) anyway uh start presenting  
[0:03:33](https://youtu.be/iyWFulQ7apg?t=213) positive arguments now yeah but i think  
[0:03:35](https://youtu.be/iyWFulQ7apg?t=215) if we  
[0:03:36](https://youtu.be/iyWFulQ7apg?t=216) if we have a database of contentions  
[0:03:39](https://youtu.be/iyWFulQ7apg?t=219) which are all  
[0:03:40](https://youtu.be/iyWFulQ7apg?t=220) kind of answered yep transcribed put  
[0:03:43](https://youtu.be/iyWFulQ7apg?t=223) online  
[0:03:44](https://youtu.be/iyWFulQ7apg?t=224) translated as well translated um  
[0:03:47](https://youtu.be/iyWFulQ7apg?t=227) and even put into book form so we will  
[0:03:50](https://youtu.be/iyWFulQ7apg?t=230) have  
[0:03:50](https://youtu.be/iyWFulQ7apg?t=230) all of the misconceptions the idea is to  
[0:03:52](https://youtu.be/iyWFulQ7apg?t=232) get all the misconceptions  
[0:03:55](https://youtu.be/iyWFulQ7apg?t=235) of islam all of them  
[0:03:58](https://youtu.be/iyWFulQ7apg?t=238) answered and for people to have a  
[0:04:01](https://youtu.be/iyWFulQ7apg?t=241) central  
[0:04:02](https://youtu.be/iyWFulQ7apg?t=242) database for that um whether it's  
[0:04:05](https://youtu.be/iyWFulQ7apg?t=245) paper-based or  
[0:04:07](https://youtu.be/iyWFulQ7apg?t=247) text based on the internet or  
[0:04:09](https://youtu.be/iyWFulQ7apg?t=249) videographic  
[0:04:10](https://youtu.be/iyWFulQ7apg?t=250) whatever it is and so people can be  
[0:04:13](https://youtu.be/iyWFulQ7apg?t=253) really comfortable  
[0:04:14](https://youtu.be/iyWFulQ7apg?t=254) you know you know confident and being  
[0:04:16](https://youtu.be/iyWFulQ7apg?t=256) able to  
[0:04:17](https://youtu.be/iyWFulQ7apg?t=257) answer them you know the the most  
[0:04:19](https://youtu.be/iyWFulQ7apg?t=259) commonly asked questions about islam  
[0:04:21](https://youtu.be/iyWFulQ7apg?t=261) from all perspectives  
[0:04:23](https://youtu.be/iyWFulQ7apg?t=263) yeah and then after that obviously if we  
[0:04:24](https://youtu.be/iyWFulQ7apg?t=264) have we'll do the same thing with  
[0:04:26](https://youtu.be/iyWFulQ7apg?t=266) the positive arguments then people will  
[0:04:29](https://youtu.be/iyWFulQ7apg?t=269) know  
[0:04:30](https://youtu.be/iyWFulQ7apg?t=270) how to answer questions that are  
[0:04:31](https://youtu.be/iyWFulQ7apg?t=271) challenging about islam and how to make  
[0:04:33](https://youtu.be/iyWFulQ7apg?t=273) a case for islam  
[0:04:34](https://youtu.be/iyWFulQ7apg?t=274) yeah that's the idea and it sounds like  
[0:04:37](https://youtu.be/iyWFulQ7apg?t=277) um it sounds like something which  
[0:04:41](https://youtu.be/iyWFulQ7apg?t=281) quite obviously is needed but just  
[0:04:43](https://youtu.be/iyWFulQ7apg?t=283) hasn't been done in the past which is  
[0:04:46](https://youtu.be/iyWFulQ7apg?t=286) i guess like an encyclopedia uh review  
[0:04:49](https://youtu.be/iyWFulQ7apg?t=289) of refuting these sort of contemporary  
[0:04:51](https://youtu.be/iyWFulQ7apg?t=291) doubts  
[0:04:52](https://youtu.be/iyWFulQ7apg?t=292) however what i would say um so just  
[0:04:54](https://youtu.be/iyWFulQ7apg?t=294) before we get into  
[0:04:56](https://youtu.be/iyWFulQ7apg?t=296) the sort of uh videos that you've made  
[0:04:59](https://youtu.be/iyWFulQ7apg?t=299) say an answer about  
[0:05:02](https://youtu.be/iyWFulQ7apg?t=302) an issue like the shooting stars or a  
[0:05:05](https://youtu.be/iyWFulQ7apg?t=305) particular science thing  
[0:05:06](https://youtu.be/iyWFulQ7apg?t=306) how is the answers that have been  
[0:05:08](https://youtu.be/iyWFulQ7apg?t=308) developed by sapience institute  
[0:05:10](https://youtu.be/iyWFulQ7apg?t=310) different  
[0:05:11](https://youtu.be/iyWFulQ7apg?t=311) to what's already out there because you  
[0:05:13](https://youtu.be/iyWFulQ7apg?t=313) will find  
[0:05:14](https://youtu.be/iyWFulQ7apg?t=314) stuff scattered all over the internet  
[0:05:17](https://youtu.be/iyWFulQ7apg?t=317) but what's the process  
[0:05:18](https://youtu.be/iyWFulQ7apg?t=318) what's the reasoning and what's the  
[0:05:20](https://youtu.be/iyWFulQ7apg?t=320) point of reinventing the wheel from one  
[0:05:22](https://youtu.be/iyWFulQ7apg?t=322) perspective someone may say well there's  
[0:05:24](https://youtu.be/iyWFulQ7apg?t=324) already good stuff out there so what are  
[0:05:25](https://youtu.be/iyWFulQ7apg?t=325) we doing  
[0:05:26](https://youtu.be/iyWFulQ7apg?t=326) we don't think there is a really good  
[0:05:28](https://youtu.be/iyWFulQ7apg?t=328) stuff out there i think this is the  
[0:05:29](https://youtu.be/iyWFulQ7apg?t=329) problem  
[0:05:30](https://youtu.be/iyWFulQ7apg?t=330) the good stuff is in different languages  
[0:05:33](https://youtu.be/iyWFulQ7apg?t=333) um  
[0:05:33](https://youtu.be/iyWFulQ7apg?t=333) not everyone had in the past that were  
[0:05:36](https://youtu.be/iyWFulQ7apg?t=336) involved in apologetics  
[0:05:38](https://youtu.be/iyWFulQ7apg?t=338) uh if you want to call it that or  
[0:05:40](https://youtu.be/iyWFulQ7apg?t=340) answering the issue will hurt  
[0:05:42](https://youtu.be/iyWFulQ7apg?t=342) now everyone had access to both  
[0:05:45](https://youtu.be/iyWFulQ7apg?t=345) strong access to both the arabic  
[0:05:47](https://youtu.be/iyWFulQ7apg?t=347) language and the english language and  
[0:05:48](https://youtu.be/iyWFulQ7apg?t=348) both  
[0:05:49](https://youtu.be/iyWFulQ7apg?t=349) the academic access to both of those  
[0:05:52](https://youtu.be/iyWFulQ7apg?t=352) languages  
[0:05:53](https://youtu.be/iyWFulQ7apg?t=353) i don't think many people in the past  
[0:05:55](https://youtu.be/iyWFulQ7apg?t=355) have had it with with the focus that we  
[0:05:57](https://youtu.be/iyWFulQ7apg?t=357) have  
[0:05:57](https://youtu.be/iyWFulQ7apg?t=357) yeah in the last 20 or 30 years and and  
[0:06:00](https://youtu.be/iyWFulQ7apg?t=360) if they did have that access  
[0:06:02](https://youtu.be/iyWFulQ7apg?t=362) they didn't direct it into a  
[0:06:04](https://youtu.be/iyWFulQ7apg?t=364) concentrated effort  
[0:06:06](https://youtu.be/iyWFulQ7apg?t=366) though the like of which where i think  
[0:06:08](https://youtu.be/iyWFulQ7apg?t=368) we're doing and that's the first thing  
[0:06:10](https://youtu.be/iyWFulQ7apg?t=370) the second thing is  
[0:06:11](https://youtu.be/iyWFulQ7apg?t=371) the method of those individuals even if  
[0:06:13](https://youtu.be/iyWFulQ7apg?t=373) they had that access  
[0:06:14](https://youtu.be/iyWFulQ7apg?t=374) was we would call it flawed to some  
[0:06:17](https://youtu.be/iyWFulQ7apg?t=377) extent for example  
[0:06:18](https://youtu.be/iyWFulQ7apg?t=378) scientific miracles narrative yeah was  
[0:06:20](https://youtu.be/iyWFulQ7apg?t=380) problematic  
[0:06:21](https://youtu.be/iyWFulQ7apg?t=381) on many different uh fronts like for  
[0:06:24](https://youtu.be/iyWFulQ7apg?t=384) example  
[0:06:25](https://youtu.be/iyWFulQ7apg?t=385) uh there was cherry picking going on  
[0:06:27](https://youtu.be/iyWFulQ7apg?t=387) yeah you know  
[0:06:29](https://youtu.be/iyWFulQ7apg?t=389) sometimes they would present facts as  
[0:06:30](https://youtu.be/iyWFulQ7apg?t=390) theories and theories as facts  
[0:06:32](https://youtu.be/iyWFulQ7apg?t=392) they would superimpose meaning into the  
[0:06:34](https://youtu.be/iyWFulQ7apg?t=394) quran or i see jesus  
[0:06:36](https://youtu.be/iyWFulQ7apg?t=396) and obviously there's other issues as  
[0:06:38](https://youtu.be/iyWFulQ7apg?t=398) well for example that  
[0:06:40](https://youtu.be/iyWFulQ7apg?t=400) i mean the assumption even the  
[0:06:42](https://youtu.be/iyWFulQ7apg?t=402) assumption is problematic to some extent  
[0:06:43](https://youtu.be/iyWFulQ7apg?t=403) with the scientific miracles narrative  
[0:06:44](https://youtu.be/iyWFulQ7apg?t=404) because the assumption sometimes is that  
[0:06:46](https://youtu.be/iyWFulQ7apg?t=406) now we know a verse what the meaning of  
[0:06:47](https://youtu.be/iyWFulQ7apg?t=407) it was  
[0:06:48](https://youtu.be/iyWFulQ7apg?t=408) and before we didn't know what the  
[0:06:49](https://youtu.be/iyWFulQ7apg?t=409) meaning of it is  
[0:06:52](https://youtu.be/iyWFulQ7apg?t=412) uh so the big bang for example  
[0:06:57](https://youtu.be/iyWFulQ7apg?t=417) you know chapter 21 verse 30 they say  
[0:06:59](https://youtu.be/iyWFulQ7apg?t=419) this is uh  
[0:07:00](https://youtu.be/iyWFulQ7apg?t=420) talking about the big bang and i've just  
[0:07:02](https://youtu.be/iyWFulQ7apg?t=422) recorded a video on this  
[0:07:04](https://youtu.be/iyWFulQ7apg?t=424) about to what extent we can make  
[0:07:07](https://youtu.be/iyWFulQ7apg?t=427) connections like that  
[0:07:08](https://youtu.be/iyWFulQ7apg?t=428) yeah but to impose definitely this  
[0:07:10](https://youtu.be/iyWFulQ7apg?t=430) talking about the big bang  
[0:07:12](https://youtu.be/iyWFulQ7apg?t=432) this is problematic kind of reasoning  
[0:07:14](https://youtu.be/iyWFulQ7apg?t=434) and because people had the method flawed  
[0:07:16](https://youtu.be/iyWFulQ7apg?t=436) one way or another and another i think  
[0:07:19](https://youtu.be/iyWFulQ7apg?t=439) academically it wasn't  
[0:07:20](https://youtu.be/iyWFulQ7apg?t=440) robust and it wasn't sophisticated yeah  
[0:07:22](https://youtu.be/iyWFulQ7apg?t=442) you had two groups of people i think for  
[0:07:24](https://youtu.be/iyWFulQ7apg?t=444) the last 20 or 30 years  
[0:07:26](https://youtu.be/iyWFulQ7apg?t=446) online uh and even in written works that  
[0:07:29](https://youtu.be/iyWFulQ7apg?t=449) have been trying to operate for example  
[0:07:30](https://youtu.be/iyWFulQ7apg?t=450) on the scientific miracles thing yeah  
[0:07:32](https://youtu.be/iyWFulQ7apg?t=452) one group is individuals who are  
[0:07:35](https://youtu.be/iyWFulQ7apg?t=455) promoting the scientific miracles  
[0:07:36](https://youtu.be/iyWFulQ7apg?t=456) narrative and the other group for  
[0:07:38](https://youtu.be/iyWFulQ7apg?t=458) example were the  
[0:07:39](https://youtu.be/iyWFulQ7apg?t=459) groups that were trying to promote the  
[0:07:40](https://youtu.be/iyWFulQ7apg?t=460) scientific characteristics yeah  
[0:07:42](https://youtu.be/iyWFulQ7apg?t=462) and both of those were employing very  
[0:07:45](https://youtu.be/iyWFulQ7apg?t=465) similar tactics quite frankly  
[0:07:47](https://youtu.be/iyWFulQ7apg?t=467) cherry picking disregarding other  
[0:07:49](https://youtu.be/iyWFulQ7apg?t=469) opinions  
[0:07:50](https://youtu.be/iyWFulQ7apg?t=470) um insisting that one opinion is more  
[0:07:52](https://youtu.be/iyWFulQ7apg?t=472) valid than the other  
[0:07:53](https://youtu.be/iyWFulQ7apg?t=473) not allowing ambiguous verses to remain  
[0:07:56](https://youtu.be/iyWFulQ7apg?t=476) ambiguous  
[0:07:57](https://youtu.be/iyWFulQ7apg?t=477) um and so on and so forth so there was  
[0:07:59](https://youtu.be/iyWFulQ7apg?t=479) issues there so there was methodological  
[0:08:01](https://youtu.be/iyWFulQ7apg?t=481) issues that that existed  
[0:08:02](https://youtu.be/iyWFulQ7apg?t=482) uh in the last 20 or 30 years which are  
[0:08:04](https://youtu.be/iyWFulQ7apg?t=484) problematic and then you had language  
[0:08:06](https://youtu.be/iyWFulQ7apg?t=486) access which was which was limited  
[0:08:08](https://youtu.be/iyWFulQ7apg?t=488) not just the language access but  
[0:08:10](https://youtu.be/iyWFulQ7apg?t=490) academic language access to both of the  
[0:08:12](https://youtu.be/iyWFulQ7apg?t=492) things and then you had another issue  
[0:08:16](https://youtu.be/iyWFulQ7apg?t=496) which is  
[0:08:17](https://youtu.be/iyWFulQ7apg?t=497) sapience is really i believe a place  
[0:08:20](https://youtu.be/iyWFulQ7apg?t=500) where you have real academics bona fide  
[0:08:22](https://youtu.be/iyWFulQ7apg?t=502) academics  
[0:08:23](https://youtu.be/iyWFulQ7apg?t=503) that have studied for example philosophy  
[0:08:25](https://youtu.be/iyWFulQ7apg?t=505) moral philosophy philosophy of religion  
[0:08:26](https://youtu.be/iyWFulQ7apg?t=506) history  
[0:08:27](https://youtu.be/iyWFulQ7apg?t=507) whatever it may be you know and we've  
[0:08:30](https://youtu.be/iyWFulQ7apg?t=510) never had people  
[0:08:31](https://youtu.be/iyWFulQ7apg?t=511) of that level you know on different  
[0:08:34](https://youtu.be/iyWFulQ7apg?t=514) specialisms all congregate in one place  
[0:08:37](https://youtu.be/iyWFulQ7apg?t=517) sharing knowledge with one another and  
[0:08:38](https://youtu.be/iyWFulQ7apg?t=518) then giving that knowledge out to people  
[0:08:41](https://youtu.be/iyWFulQ7apg?t=521) in the dow in the past we didn't have  
[0:08:42](https://youtu.be/iyWFulQ7apg?t=522) people of that level  
[0:08:44](https://youtu.be/iyWFulQ7apg?t=524) on these matters because from our data  
[0:08:47](https://youtu.be/iyWFulQ7apg?t=527) that we have the the thing actually  
[0:08:50](https://youtu.be/iyWFulQ7apg?t=530) uh that threatens the emanuel people the  
[0:08:52](https://youtu.be/iyWFulQ7apg?t=532) most it's not these scientific miracles  
[0:08:54](https://youtu.be/iyWFulQ7apg?t=534) or the supposed contradictions but it's  
[0:08:56](https://youtu.be/iyWFulQ7apg?t=536) actually morality okay so just before  
[0:08:58](https://youtu.be/iyWFulQ7apg?t=538) you get into that yeah  
[0:08:59](https://youtu.be/iyWFulQ7apg?t=539) um and this is where i think things are  
[0:09:01](https://youtu.be/iyWFulQ7apg?t=541) very important  
[0:09:02](https://youtu.be/iyWFulQ7apg?t=542) with the way that uh we work within  
[0:09:04](https://youtu.be/iyWFulQ7apg?t=544) sapiens  
[0:09:05](https://youtu.be/iyWFulQ7apg?t=545) so um i remember a few months back when  
[0:09:08](https://youtu.be/iyWFulQ7apg?t=548) you did this project  
[0:09:10](https://youtu.be/iyWFulQ7apg?t=550) um and this project you were working  
[0:09:12](https://youtu.be/iyWFulQ7apg?t=552) with academics at edinburgh  
[0:09:14](https://youtu.be/iyWFulQ7apg?t=554) and it was a sort of an  
[0:09:17](https://youtu.be/iyWFulQ7apg?t=557) analysis of data online and also a  
[0:09:20](https://youtu.be/iyWFulQ7apg?t=560) qualitative research into  
[0:09:23](https://youtu.be/iyWFulQ7apg?t=563) why you have apostasies from a christian  
[0:09:25](https://youtu.be/iyWFulQ7apg?t=565) and a muslim perspective  
[0:09:26](https://youtu.be/iyWFulQ7apg?t=566) and then you actually came forward and  
[0:09:28](https://youtu.be/iyWFulQ7apg?t=568) said it's the moral issue guys  
[0:09:31](https://youtu.be/iyWFulQ7apg?t=571) yeah and when i first heard that it  
[0:09:34](https://youtu.be/iyWFulQ7apg?t=574) got me a little bit rattled yeah i was  
[0:09:37](https://youtu.be/iyWFulQ7apg?t=577) kind of like  
[0:09:38](https://youtu.be/iyWFulQ7apg?t=578) um we're going in the wrong direction so  
[0:09:40](https://youtu.be/iyWFulQ7apg?t=580) for  
[0:09:41](https://youtu.be/iyWFulQ7apg?t=581) many many years this was a big thing  
[0:09:43](https://youtu.be/iyWFulQ7apg?t=583) it's scientism it's darwinism it's  
[0:09:45](https://youtu.be/iyWFulQ7apg?t=585) liberalism it's this is this is this  
[0:09:47](https://youtu.be/iyWFulQ7apg?t=587) it's that  
[0:09:48](https://youtu.be/iyWFulQ7apg?t=588) it's some sort of intellectual problem  
[0:09:51](https://youtu.be/iyWFulQ7apg?t=591) but then that data  
[0:09:53](https://youtu.be/iyWFulQ7apg?t=593) and if you can if you can explain how  
[0:09:54](https://youtu.be/iyWFulQ7apg?t=594) that data came about  
[0:09:56](https://youtu.be/iyWFulQ7apg?t=596) and the decision made from that which  
[0:09:58](https://youtu.be/iyWFulQ7apg?t=598) you're making  
[0:09:59](https://youtu.be/iyWFulQ7apg?t=599) in terms of what to concentrate on  
[0:10:01](https://youtu.be/iyWFulQ7apg?t=601) clearly shows the research  
[0:10:03](https://youtu.be/iyWFulQ7apg?t=603) angle the data led decisions of the  
[0:10:06](https://youtu.be/iyWFulQ7apg?t=606) institute which allows us to actually  
[0:10:08](https://youtu.be/iyWFulQ7apg?t=608) surgically  
[0:10:10](https://youtu.be/iyWFulQ7apg?t=610) focus in on the problems rather than  
[0:10:12](https://youtu.be/iyWFulQ7apg?t=612) saying  
[0:10:13](https://youtu.be/iyWFulQ7apg?t=613) we think science is the issue and here's  
[0:10:16](https://youtu.be/iyWFulQ7apg?t=616) what we  
[0:10:17](https://youtu.be/iyWFulQ7apg?t=617) think is the answer rather it's actually  
[0:10:19](https://youtu.be/iyWFulQ7apg?t=619) data led and i think that's that's key  
[0:10:21](https://youtu.be/iyWFulQ7apg?t=621) here  
[0:10:22](https://youtu.be/iyWFulQ7apg?t=622) is data led and we've got professionals  
[0:10:25](https://youtu.be/iyWFulQ7apg?t=625) uh  
[0:10:26](https://youtu.be/iyWFulQ7apg?t=626) obviously lecturers in universities and  
[0:10:27](https://youtu.be/iyWFulQ7apg?t=627) aberdeen  
[0:10:29](https://youtu.be/iyWFulQ7apg?t=629) uh and other different universities  
[0:10:30](https://youtu.be/iyWFulQ7apg?t=630) oxford and so on like helping us  
[0:10:32](https://youtu.be/iyWFulQ7apg?t=632) understand what their problem is and  
[0:10:36](https://youtu.be/iyWFulQ7apg?t=636) in terms of in terms of doubts in terms  
[0:10:38](https://youtu.be/iyWFulQ7apg?t=638) of apostasies and all those things  
[0:10:41](https://youtu.be/iyWFulQ7apg?t=641) and additionally it in terms of bringing  
[0:10:43](https://youtu.be/iyWFulQ7apg?t=643) in people to islam what people find most  
[0:10:45](https://youtu.be/iyWFulQ7apg?t=645) convincing as well  
[0:10:46](https://youtu.be/iyWFulQ7apg?t=646) yeah and these are the two avenues we're  
[0:10:48](https://youtu.be/iyWFulQ7apg?t=648) exploring but in terms of  
[0:10:50](https://youtu.be/iyWFulQ7apg?t=650) there's no doubt it's an open secret  
[0:10:52](https://youtu.be/iyWFulQ7apg?t=652) really now that  
[0:10:53](https://youtu.be/iyWFulQ7apg?t=653) the uh in terms of all the shubu the  
[0:10:56](https://youtu.be/iyWFulQ7apg?t=656) categories of should we head or the  
[0:10:58](https://youtu.be/iyWFulQ7apg?t=658) categories of  
[0:10:59](https://youtu.be/iyWFulQ7apg?t=659) um doubts that people have morality is  
[0:11:02](https://youtu.be/iyWFulQ7apg?t=662) number one there's nothing  
[0:11:03](https://youtu.be/iyWFulQ7apg?t=663) about that yes we're talking about  
[0:11:05](https://youtu.be/iyWFulQ7apg?t=665) women's rights issues to do with women's  
[0:11:07](https://youtu.be/iyWFulQ7apg?t=667) rights  
[0:11:08](https://youtu.be/iyWFulQ7apg?t=668) issues to do with liberalism  
[0:11:11](https://youtu.be/iyWFulQ7apg?t=671) those things are central now and quite  
[0:11:14](https://youtu.be/iyWFulQ7apg?t=674) frankly  
[0:11:15](https://youtu.be/iyWFulQ7apg?t=675) we've not had people that are as trained  
[0:11:18](https://youtu.be/iyWFulQ7apg?t=678) as  
[0:11:19](https://youtu.be/iyWFulQ7apg?t=679) as like i said before in these areas  
[0:11:22](https://youtu.be/iyWFulQ7apg?t=682) political philosophy moral philosophy  
[0:11:24](https://youtu.be/iyWFulQ7apg?t=684) and philosophy of religion  
[0:11:26](https://youtu.be/iyWFulQ7apg?t=686) philosophy of science as we do together  
[0:11:29](https://youtu.be/iyWFulQ7apg?t=689) congregate in one place  
[0:11:30](https://youtu.be/iyWFulQ7apg?t=690) and willing by the way and this is an  
[0:11:32](https://youtu.be/iyWFulQ7apg?t=692) important difference  
[0:11:33](https://youtu.be/iyWFulQ7apg?t=693) willing to attack feminism and  
[0:11:35](https://youtu.be/iyWFulQ7apg?t=695) liberalism and stuff like that there are  
[0:11:37](https://youtu.be/iyWFulQ7apg?t=697) other institutes out there  
[0:11:38](https://youtu.be/iyWFulQ7apg?t=698) that do great work but they for  
[0:11:40](https://youtu.be/iyWFulQ7apg?t=700) political reasons will not attack  
[0:11:41](https://youtu.be/iyWFulQ7apg?t=701) liberalism and feminism  
[0:11:43](https://youtu.be/iyWFulQ7apg?t=703) uh they will not attack those things or  
[0:11:44](https://youtu.be/iyWFulQ7apg?t=704) definitely not liberalism  
[0:11:46](https://youtu.be/iyWFulQ7apg?t=706) because they have uh connections with  
[0:11:48](https://youtu.be/iyWFulQ7apg?t=708) the with the liberal left  
[0:11:49](https://youtu.be/iyWFulQ7apg?t=709) for example yeah but this is the head of  
[0:11:51](https://youtu.be/iyWFulQ7apg?t=711) the snake if we cut if we cannot attack  
[0:11:54](https://youtu.be/iyWFulQ7apg?t=714) liberalism we're not going to be on the  
[0:11:55](https://youtu.be/iyWFulQ7apg?t=715) back foot  
[0:11:56](https://youtu.be/iyWFulQ7apg?t=716) or if we cannot attack second wave  
[0:11:58](https://youtu.be/iyWFulQ7apg?t=718) feminism in particular we're definitely  
[0:12:00](https://youtu.be/iyWFulQ7apg?t=720) going to back foot  
[0:12:01](https://youtu.be/iyWFulQ7apg?t=721) so we've been doing it wrong i believe  
[0:12:03](https://youtu.be/iyWFulQ7apg?t=723) because we have been trying to persuade  
[0:12:05](https://youtu.be/iyWFulQ7apg?t=725) people like  
[0:12:06](https://youtu.be/iyWFulQ7apg?t=726) if you look at the apologists arguments  
[0:12:08](https://youtu.be/iyWFulQ7apg?t=728) on morality like in the last 20 or 30  
[0:12:10](https://youtu.be/iyWFulQ7apg?t=730) years  
[0:12:11](https://youtu.be/iyWFulQ7apg?t=731) why is polygamy uh allowed in islam or  
[0:12:13](https://youtu.be/iyWFulQ7apg?t=733) because there's more men than women it's  
[0:12:14](https://youtu.be/iyWFulQ7apg?t=734) a really  
[0:12:15](https://youtu.be/iyWFulQ7apg?t=735) respect is quite a pathetic argument  
[0:12:18](https://youtu.be/iyWFulQ7apg?t=738) there's more than women it's not  
[0:12:19](https://youtu.be/iyWFulQ7apg?t=739) allah it's not hikam it's for me i i  
[0:12:21](https://youtu.be/iyWFulQ7apg?t=741) don't i've never been convinced by that  
[0:12:23](https://youtu.be/iyWFulQ7apg?t=743) would you respect that the larger  
[0:12:25](https://youtu.be/iyWFulQ7apg?t=745) problem it creates is uh there's more  
[0:12:27](https://youtu.be/iyWFulQ7apg?t=747) men  
[0:12:28](https://youtu.be/iyWFulQ7apg?t=748) in china than women we should yeah yeah  
[0:12:31](https://youtu.be/iyWFulQ7apg?t=751) it's it's it's like this is the level  
[0:12:33](https://youtu.be/iyWFulQ7apg?t=753) that we were operating yeah yeah  
[0:12:34](https://youtu.be/iyWFulQ7apg?t=754) in a way we got away on a wing and a  
[0:12:36](https://youtu.be/iyWFulQ7apg?t=756) prayer at that time  
[0:12:38](https://youtu.be/iyWFulQ7apg?t=758) yeah it did but we can't do that we  
[0:12:39](https://youtu.be/iyWFulQ7apg?t=759) can't do that anymore no um  
[0:12:41](https://youtu.be/iyWFulQ7apg?t=761) that's not gonna satisfy anybody the  
[0:12:42](https://youtu.be/iyWFulQ7apg?t=762) truth of the matter is um  
[0:12:44](https://youtu.be/iyWFulQ7apg?t=764) we have a different paradigm to  
[0:12:45](https://youtu.be/iyWFulQ7apg?t=765) feminists second wave feminists  
[0:12:47](https://youtu.be/iyWFulQ7apg?t=767) and the fact that we have we have now  
[0:12:50](https://youtu.be/iyWFulQ7apg?t=770) diagnosed the problem  
[0:12:51](https://youtu.be/iyWFulQ7apg?t=771) in a different way we have not we have  
[0:12:54](https://youtu.be/iyWFulQ7apg?t=774) diagnosed the problem in a different way  
[0:12:55](https://youtu.be/iyWFulQ7apg?t=775) it's the first step we know what the  
[0:12:57](https://youtu.be/iyWFulQ7apg?t=777) problem is people are now looking into  
[0:12:59](https://youtu.be/iyWFulQ7apg?t=779) the quran  
[0:13:00](https://youtu.be/iyWFulQ7apg?t=780) with a liberal with a small liberal  
[0:13:03](https://youtu.be/iyWFulQ7apg?t=783) mindset or the feminist mindset  
[0:13:04](https://youtu.be/iyWFulQ7apg?t=784) yeah and they are comparing liberal  
[0:13:06](https://youtu.be/iyWFulQ7apg?t=786) ethics with islamic ethics so we have to  
[0:13:08](https://youtu.be/iyWFulQ7apg?t=788) bring that to the fore  
[0:13:09](https://youtu.be/iyWFulQ7apg?t=789) and show what the inconsistencies are  
[0:13:11](https://youtu.be/iyWFulQ7apg?t=791) here and how to solve these  
[0:13:12](https://youtu.be/iyWFulQ7apg?t=792) inconsistencies okay so  
[0:13:14](https://youtu.be/iyWFulQ7apg?t=794) just before we get into that i mean um  
[0:13:16](https://youtu.be/iyWFulQ7apg?t=796) by the way everybody that's watching i  
[0:13:18](https://youtu.be/iyWFulQ7apg?t=798) am actually watching very closely and  
[0:13:20](https://youtu.be/iyWFulQ7apg?t=800) i'm trying to absorb the questions  
[0:13:22](https://youtu.be/iyWFulQ7apg?t=802) coming in the comments coming in  
[0:13:24](https://youtu.be/iyWFulQ7apg?t=804) now something uh which because of the  
[0:13:26](https://youtu.be/iyWFulQ7apg?t=806) level of comments coming in  
[0:13:27](https://youtu.be/iyWFulQ7apg?t=807) rather than trying to address each  
[0:13:29](https://youtu.be/iyWFulQ7apg?t=809) question which we inshallah will do  
[0:13:31](https://youtu.be/iyWFulQ7apg?t=811) uh when it's relevant something that is  
[0:13:34](https://youtu.be/iyWFulQ7apg?t=814) coming up is  
[0:13:35](https://youtu.be/iyWFulQ7apg?t=815) the idea that you know you guys are  
[0:13:38](https://youtu.be/iyWFulQ7apg?t=818) using  
[0:13:39](https://youtu.be/iyWFulQ7apg?t=819) um you've been trained um  
[0:13:42](https://youtu.be/iyWFulQ7apg?t=822) many of you uh from a western  
[0:13:44](https://youtu.be/iyWFulQ7apg?t=824) philosophical perspective  
[0:13:46](https://youtu.be/iyWFulQ7apg?t=826) and you know you're trying to undermine  
[0:13:48](https://youtu.be/iyWFulQ7apg?t=828) liberalism and scientism and these types  
[0:13:50](https://youtu.be/iyWFulQ7apg?t=830) of things  
[0:13:51](https://youtu.be/iyWFulQ7apg?t=831) but you're using essentially a tool  
[0:13:54](https://youtu.be/iyWFulQ7apg?t=834) which is the very tool which according  
[0:13:56](https://youtu.be/iyWFulQ7apg?t=836) to the argument  
[0:13:57](https://youtu.be/iyWFulQ7apg?t=837) is the the cause of the doubts in the  
[0:14:00](https://youtu.be/iyWFulQ7apg?t=840) first place  
[0:14:00](https://youtu.be/iyWFulQ7apg?t=840) i.e in other words um you're using  
[0:14:04](https://youtu.be/iyWFulQ7apg?t=844) philosophy and these philosophical ideas  
[0:14:07](https://youtu.be/iyWFulQ7apg?t=847) and they're questioning the legitimacy  
[0:14:09](https://youtu.be/iyWFulQ7apg?t=849) of using philosophy to refute these  
[0:14:12](https://youtu.be/iyWFulQ7apg?t=852) ideas  
[0:14:13](https://youtu.be/iyWFulQ7apg?t=853) and in fact quite directly one of the  
[0:14:16](https://youtu.be/iyWFulQ7apg?t=856) comments was that  
[0:14:17](https://youtu.be/iyWFulQ7apg?t=857) it's um there seems to be a  
[0:14:20](https://youtu.be/iyWFulQ7apg?t=860) scholarly consensus that using  
[0:14:22](https://youtu.be/iyWFulQ7apg?t=862) philosophy is  
[0:14:24](https://youtu.be/iyWFulQ7apg?t=864) uh forbidden in islam so can we deal  
[0:14:26](https://youtu.be/iyWFulQ7apg?t=866) with that elephant in the room before we  
[0:14:29](https://youtu.be/iyWFulQ7apg?t=869) um move on yeah we can uh absolutely  
[0:14:32](https://youtu.be/iyWFulQ7apg?t=872) first we have to define what philosophy  
[0:14:34](https://youtu.be/iyWFulQ7apg?t=874) is yeah because when in the medieval  
[0:14:36](https://youtu.be/iyWFulQ7apg?t=876) time period  
[0:14:37](https://youtu.be/iyWFulQ7apg?t=877) the when the olympia were talking about  
[0:14:39](https://youtu.be/iyWFulQ7apg?t=879) el phalesifera they were talking about  
[0:14:41](https://youtu.be/iyWFulQ7apg?t=881) edmonton's followers  
[0:14:43](https://youtu.be/iyWFulQ7apg?t=883) anyone who knows who reads uh  
[0:14:46](https://youtu.be/iyWFulQ7apg?t=886) to have to philosophize that's what  
[0:14:49](https://youtu.be/iyWFulQ7apg?t=889) they're talking about they're not  
[0:14:50](https://youtu.be/iyWFulQ7apg?t=890) talking about  
[0:14:50](https://youtu.be/iyWFulQ7apg?t=890) there was some this discussion about is  
[0:14:52](https://youtu.be/iyWFulQ7apg?t=892) monte carlo  
[0:14:54](https://youtu.be/iyWFulQ7apg?t=894) anything like that but at the end of the  
[0:14:56](https://youtu.be/iyWFulQ7apg?t=896) day right now  
[0:14:58](https://youtu.be/iyWFulQ7apg?t=898) it's one of those things where first and  
[0:15:01](https://youtu.be/iyWFulQ7apg?t=901) foremost  
[0:15:01](https://youtu.be/iyWFulQ7apg?t=901) if you want me to bring quotations from  
[0:15:03](https://youtu.be/iyWFulQ7apg?t=903) ibn tamiya and whatnot we have those  
[0:15:05](https://youtu.be/iyWFulQ7apg?t=905) that he allowed it and he even in many  
[0:15:08](https://youtu.be/iyWFulQ7apg?t=908) different places  
[0:15:12](https://youtu.be/iyWFulQ7apg?t=912) he says some people require he said this  
[0:15:14](https://youtu.be/iyWFulQ7apg?t=914) some people i'm paraphrasing here but  
[0:15:16](https://youtu.be/iyWFulQ7apg?t=916) i've got a  
[0:15:16](https://youtu.be/iyWFulQ7apg?t=916) i've got these kinds of quotes some  
[0:15:17](https://youtu.be/iyWFulQ7apg?t=917) people require philosophical arguments  
[0:15:19](https://youtu.be/iyWFulQ7apg?t=919) for them you have to give it to them  
[0:15:20](https://youtu.be/iyWFulQ7apg?t=920) yeah the the types of arguments you give  
[0:15:23](https://youtu.be/iyWFulQ7apg?t=923) them are philosophical because  
[0:15:25](https://youtu.be/iyWFulQ7apg?t=925) it's like going into a fight a gunfight  
[0:15:28](https://youtu.be/iyWFulQ7apg?t=928) with a knife with a pencil honestly it's  
[0:15:31](https://youtu.be/iyWFulQ7apg?t=931) like  
[0:15:32](https://youtu.be/iyWFulQ7apg?t=932) if it's ridiculous i i'm actually  
[0:15:34](https://youtu.be/iyWFulQ7apg?t=934) surprised that we even having this  
[0:15:35](https://youtu.be/iyWFulQ7apg?t=935) discussion  
[0:15:36](https://youtu.be/iyWFulQ7apg?t=936) it's what it's like is this like let me  
[0:15:38](https://youtu.be/iyWFulQ7apg?t=938) let me give you an energy like 25  
[0:15:40](https://youtu.be/iyWFulQ7apg?t=940) years ago mma started 1994 i think it  
[0:15:42](https://youtu.be/iyWFulQ7apg?t=942) was the first time  
[0:15:43](https://youtu.be/iyWFulQ7apg?t=943) ms yeah and uh they had ufc one  
[0:15:46](https://youtu.be/iyWFulQ7apg?t=946) ufc one was uh with hoist gracie and all  
[0:15:50](https://youtu.be/iyWFulQ7apg?t=950) of that and he  
[0:15:51](https://youtu.be/iyWFulQ7apg?t=951) he won the even though he was quite  
[0:15:52](https://youtu.be/iyWFulQ7apg?t=952) small he beat the blue guys  
[0:15:54](https://youtu.be/iyWFulQ7apg?t=954) yeah uh shamrock there's no there's no  
[0:15:56](https://youtu.be/iyWFulQ7apg?t=956) weight categories  
[0:15:58](https://youtu.be/iyWFulQ7apg?t=958) yeah yeah yeah i don't know how the  
[0:15:59](https://youtu.be/iyWFulQ7apg?t=959) weight characters work and it was like a  
[0:16:00](https://youtu.be/iyWFulQ7apg?t=960) one continuous round or something like  
[0:16:02](https://youtu.be/iyWFulQ7apg?t=962) that i can't remember exactly what the  
[0:16:03](https://youtu.be/iyWFulQ7apg?t=963) rules were  
[0:16:04](https://youtu.be/iyWFulQ7apg?t=964) but the mixed martial arts had changed  
[0:16:08](https://youtu.be/iyWFulQ7apg?t=968) forever  
[0:16:08](https://youtu.be/iyWFulQ7apg?t=968) everyone knew now what was effective and  
[0:16:11](https://youtu.be/iyWFulQ7apg?t=971) what was not effective  
[0:16:12](https://youtu.be/iyWFulQ7apg?t=972) it took about 20 years to find out and  
[0:16:14](https://youtu.be/iyWFulQ7apg?t=974) we found out what was effective in laws  
[0:16:15](https://youtu.be/iyWFulQ7apg?t=975) in africa  
[0:16:16](https://youtu.be/iyWFulQ7apg?t=976) we found out grappling bjj muay thai  
[0:16:20](https://youtu.be/iyWFulQ7apg?t=980) freestyle wrestling or [ __ ] even these  
[0:16:22](https://youtu.be/iyWFulQ7apg?t=982) things are very effective  
[0:16:23](https://youtu.be/iyWFulQ7apg?t=983) some aspects of taekwondo they were  
[0:16:25](https://youtu.be/iyWFulQ7apg?t=985) effective some aspects of karate were  
[0:16:27](https://youtu.be/iyWFulQ7apg?t=987) not all of it were effective the things  
[0:16:28](https://youtu.be/iyWFulQ7apg?t=988) were not effective were  
[0:16:30](https://youtu.be/iyWFulQ7apg?t=990) the things that were not affected that  
[0:16:31](https://youtu.be/iyWFulQ7apg?t=991) people are not doing now  
[0:16:33](https://youtu.be/iyWFulQ7apg?t=993) so if you want to be an mma fighter you  
[0:16:35](https://youtu.be/iyWFulQ7apg?t=995) have to learn  
[0:16:36](https://youtu.be/iyWFulQ7apg?t=996) now you have to learn for example bjj  
[0:16:38](https://youtu.be/iyWFulQ7apg?t=998) you have to learn freestyle wrestling  
[0:16:40](https://youtu.be/iyWFulQ7apg?t=1000) you have to you have to know somebody  
[0:16:42](https://youtu.be/iyWFulQ7apg?t=1002) you have to know at least if you're a  
[0:16:43](https://youtu.be/iyWFulQ7apg?t=1003) striker you have to know how to  
[0:16:44](https://youtu.be/iyWFulQ7apg?t=1004) anti-grapple you have to that's if you  
[0:16:46](https://youtu.be/iyWFulQ7apg?t=1006) don't you're going to lose  
[0:16:47](https://youtu.be/iyWFulQ7apg?t=1007) simple as that really and now if we if  
[0:16:50](https://youtu.be/iyWFulQ7apg?t=1010) we're saying to the  
[0:16:51](https://youtu.be/iyWFulQ7apg?t=1011) now that you want to do dawah and you  
[0:16:53](https://youtu.be/iyWFulQ7apg?t=1013) don't want to know the basics of  
[0:16:54](https://youtu.be/iyWFulQ7apg?t=1014) philosophy or at least how to deal with  
[0:16:56](https://youtu.be/iyWFulQ7apg?t=1016) shubu head philosophically and how to  
[0:16:58](https://youtu.be/iyWFulQ7apg?t=1018) answer or put go on the offensive  
[0:17:01](https://youtu.be/iyWFulQ7apg?t=1021) philosophically  
[0:17:02](https://youtu.be/iyWFulQ7apg?t=1022) it's just like getting a fighter to go  
[0:17:04](https://youtu.be/iyWFulQ7apg?t=1024) into  
[0:17:05](https://youtu.be/iyWFulQ7apg?t=1025) an arena like mma or something not  
[0:17:07](https://youtu.be/iyWFulQ7apg?t=1027) teaching them grappling  
[0:17:09](https://youtu.be/iyWFulQ7apg?t=1029) um giving them one dimensional type of  
[0:17:11](https://youtu.be/iyWFulQ7apg?t=1031) uh  
[0:17:12](https://youtu.be/iyWFulQ7apg?t=1032) do you try condo do taekwondo and then  
[0:17:14](https://youtu.be/iyWFulQ7apg?t=1034) go into the ring they'll be finished  
[0:17:15](https://youtu.be/iyWFulQ7apg?t=1035) straight away  
[0:17:16](https://youtu.be/iyWFulQ7apg?t=1036) and what it is now is that at the end of  
[0:17:18](https://youtu.be/iyWFulQ7apg?t=1038) the day we have to act strategically  
[0:17:20](https://youtu.be/iyWFulQ7apg?t=1040) because  
[0:17:21](https://youtu.be/iyWFulQ7apg?t=1041) the here the objective is to with that  
[0:17:25](https://youtu.be/iyWFulQ7apg?t=1045) that we bring allah's word and make it  
[0:17:27](https://youtu.be/iyWFulQ7apg?t=1047) the higher most this is the strategy  
[0:17:30](https://youtu.be/iyWFulQ7apg?t=1050) in a strategy of war i'm sorry to say  
[0:17:32](https://youtu.be/iyWFulQ7apg?t=1052) back in the days  
[0:17:33](https://youtu.be/iyWFulQ7apg?t=1053) you know when the books were back in the  
[0:17:35](https://youtu.be/iyWFulQ7apg?t=1055) days right with strategies of  
[0:17:37](https://youtu.be/iyWFulQ7apg?t=1057) uh physical war that were taken into  
[0:17:39](https://youtu.be/iyWFulQ7apg?t=1059) place people would do things that were  
[0:17:41](https://youtu.be/iyWFulQ7apg?t=1061) most  
[0:17:42](https://youtu.be/iyWFulQ7apg?t=1062) conducive yeah we're not going to put  
[0:17:44](https://youtu.be/iyWFulQ7apg?t=1064) ourselves in a position where  
[0:17:46](https://youtu.be/iyWFulQ7apg?t=1066) we have to someone's going to come and  
[0:17:48](https://youtu.be/iyWFulQ7apg?t=1068) ask us questions to do with  
[0:17:50](https://youtu.be/iyWFulQ7apg?t=1070) philosophy or philosophy of science or  
[0:17:52](https://youtu.be/iyWFulQ7apg?t=1072) moral philosophy and these are the main  
[0:17:53](https://youtu.be/iyWFulQ7apg?t=1073) questions being asked  
[0:17:54](https://youtu.be/iyWFulQ7apg?t=1074) against islam today and the one thing we  
[0:17:57](https://youtu.be/iyWFulQ7apg?t=1077) can do is respond by saying but islam  
[0:17:58](https://youtu.be/iyWFulQ7apg?t=1078) gave women rights that they didn't have  
[0:18:00](https://youtu.be/iyWFulQ7apg?t=1080) before  
[0:18:01](https://youtu.be/iyWFulQ7apg?t=1081) you know polygamy was limited from  
[0:18:02](https://youtu.be/iyWFulQ7apg?t=1082) unlimited to four uh  
[0:18:04](https://youtu.be/iyWFulQ7apg?t=1084) or that for example uh uh you know one  
[0:18:07](https://youtu.be/iyWFulQ7apg?t=1087) of the  
[0:18:08](https://youtu.be/iyWFulQ7apg?t=1088) talaq is this and or this issue or hijab  
[0:18:10](https://youtu.be/iyWFulQ7apg?t=1090) is this issue and  
[0:18:11](https://youtu.be/iyWFulQ7apg?t=1091) we're answering to yeah  
[0:18:14](https://youtu.be/iyWFulQ7apg?t=1094) it's been for me it's been on  
[0:18:16](https://youtu.be/iyWFulQ7apg?t=1096) satisfaction  
[0:18:18](https://youtu.be/iyWFulQ7apg?t=1098) i've been this satisfied with the whole  
[0:18:20](https://youtu.be/iyWFulQ7apg?t=1100) thing so we have to teach  
[0:18:22](https://youtu.be/iyWFulQ7apg?t=1102) yeah anyone that want to get is this  
[0:18:24](https://youtu.be/iyWFulQ7apg?t=1104) game this dollar game now if you want to  
[0:18:25](https://youtu.be/iyWFulQ7apg?t=1105) bring it into the  
[0:18:26](https://youtu.be/iyWFulQ7apg?t=1106) to the analogy of uh dawah you can't do  
[0:18:29](https://youtu.be/iyWFulQ7apg?t=1109) it  
[0:18:30](https://youtu.be/iyWFulQ7apg?t=1110) right now in the 21st century i will  
[0:18:31](https://youtu.be/iyWFulQ7apg?t=1111) even go as far as to say  
[0:18:33](https://youtu.be/iyWFulQ7apg?t=1113) you you'll be unsuccessful if you don't  
[0:18:35](https://youtu.be/iyWFulQ7apg?t=1115) have this grounding it will be  
[0:18:36](https://youtu.be/iyWFulQ7apg?t=1116) unsuccessful  
[0:18:37](https://youtu.be/iyWFulQ7apg?t=1117) okay so that's obviously something that  
[0:18:40](https://youtu.be/iyWFulQ7apg?t=1120) we can see when you're involved in the  
[0:18:43](https://youtu.be/iyWFulQ7apg?t=1123) arena you're directly there  
[0:18:45](https://youtu.be/iyWFulQ7apg?t=1125) but would you say there is a a  
[0:18:48](https://youtu.be/iyWFulQ7apg?t=1128) a gap between say the older generation  
[0:18:52](https://youtu.be/iyWFulQ7apg?t=1132) who maybe have just seen stuff like  
[0:18:54](https://youtu.be/iyWFulQ7apg?t=1134) ahmedida  
[0:18:55](https://youtu.be/iyWFulQ7apg?t=1135) using the bible you know just refuting  
[0:18:58](https://youtu.be/iyWFulQ7apg?t=1138) and  
[0:18:59](https://youtu.be/iyWFulQ7apg?t=1139) then also just other people just using  
[0:19:01](https://youtu.be/iyWFulQ7apg?t=1141) the quran and just  
[0:19:02](https://youtu.be/iyWFulQ7apg?t=1142) speaking to others and then not really  
[0:19:05](https://youtu.be/iyWFulQ7apg?t=1145) realizing  
[0:19:06](https://youtu.be/iyWFulQ7apg?t=1146) that actually this issue is is  
[0:19:10](https://youtu.be/iyWFulQ7apg?t=1150) far more prevalent at a grassroots level  
[0:19:12](https://youtu.be/iyWFulQ7apg?t=1152) than it was 20 30 years ago at a  
[0:19:14](https://youtu.be/iyWFulQ7apg?t=1154) grassroot level 20 30 years ago  
[0:19:16](https://youtu.be/iyWFulQ7apg?t=1156) you know philosophical arguments against  
[0:19:18](https://youtu.be/iyWFulQ7apg?t=1158) islam or you know these types of  
[0:19:20](https://youtu.be/iyWFulQ7apg?t=1160) hardcore atheistic narratives they  
[0:19:23](https://youtu.be/iyWFulQ7apg?t=1163) hadn't really penetrated  
[0:19:24](https://youtu.be/iyWFulQ7apg?t=1164) so would you say that um i mean again  
[0:19:27](https://youtu.be/iyWFulQ7apg?t=1167) we're not  
[0:19:27](https://youtu.be/iyWFulQ7apg?t=1167) um we're not pointing fingers here but  
[0:19:29](https://youtu.be/iyWFulQ7apg?t=1169) we're saying  
[0:19:31](https://youtu.be/iyWFulQ7apg?t=1171) it's it's almost like to really  
[0:19:33](https://youtu.be/iyWFulQ7apg?t=1173) understand  
[0:19:34](https://youtu.be/iyWFulQ7apg?t=1174) what you're saying in terms of the  
[0:19:36](https://youtu.be/iyWFulQ7apg?t=1176) natural selection of ideas that happens  
[0:19:37](https://youtu.be/iyWFulQ7apg?t=1177) within the  
[0:19:38](https://youtu.be/iyWFulQ7apg?t=1178) mma of the tower you have to feel the  
[0:19:41](https://youtu.be/iyWFulQ7apg?t=1181) pain  
[0:19:42](https://youtu.be/iyWFulQ7apg?t=1182) before you realize and it's very  
[0:19:43](https://youtu.be/iyWFulQ7apg?t=1183) comfortable sitting in  
[0:19:45](https://youtu.be/iyWFulQ7apg?t=1185) sitting in a say the middle east and  
[0:19:47](https://youtu.be/iyWFulQ7apg?t=1187) you're not affected by any of that and  
[0:19:49](https://youtu.be/iyWFulQ7apg?t=1189) you're kind of like  
[0:19:49](https://youtu.be/iyWFulQ7apg?t=1189) well why are you doing that like you're  
[0:19:51](https://youtu.be/iyWFulQ7apg?t=1191) not in the thick of it and you have no  
[0:19:52](https://youtu.be/iyWFulQ7apg?t=1192) idea what's going on  
[0:19:53](https://youtu.be/iyWFulQ7apg?t=1193) yeah absolutely i think you said it  
[0:19:55](https://youtu.be/iyWFulQ7apg?t=1195) perfectly  
[0:19:56](https://youtu.be/iyWFulQ7apg?t=1196) it's only when these in the same  
[0:19:58](https://youtu.be/iyWFulQ7apg?t=1198) individuals and i must say from my own  
[0:20:00](https://youtu.be/iyWFulQ7apg?t=1200) experience is exactly  
[0:20:01](https://youtu.be/iyWFulQ7apg?t=1201) how you said it is because i've known  
[0:20:04](https://youtu.be/iyWFulQ7apg?t=1204) people that were let's say  
[0:20:05](https://youtu.be/iyWFulQ7apg?t=1205) very conservative maybe salafis that are  
[0:20:07](https://youtu.be/iyWFulQ7apg?t=1207) you know  
[0:20:08](https://youtu.be/iyWFulQ7apg?t=1208) associated with and that have this very  
[0:20:10](https://youtu.be/iyWFulQ7apg?t=1210) strong stance against uh philosophy and  
[0:20:12](https://youtu.be/iyWFulQ7apg?t=1212) stuff like that  
[0:20:13](https://youtu.be/iyWFulQ7apg?t=1213) and they say it's against the salaf and  
[0:20:15](https://youtu.be/iyWFulQ7apg?t=1215) you know i know chef i would hit with  
[0:20:16](https://youtu.be/iyWFulQ7apg?t=1216) the shoe and this and that they're  
[0:20:18](https://youtu.be/iyWFulQ7apg?t=1218) taking everything out of context well  
[0:20:19](https://youtu.be/iyWFulQ7apg?t=1219) like yeah even though a chef i wrote a  
[0:20:21](https://youtu.be/iyWFulQ7apg?t=1221) reseller which is basically a  
[0:20:23](https://youtu.be/iyWFulQ7apg?t=1223) it's a logic book and i think this is  
[0:20:25](https://youtu.be/iyWFulQ7apg?t=1225) very important  
[0:20:26](https://youtu.be/iyWFulQ7apg?t=1226) this is actually technically a fallacy  
[0:20:28](https://youtu.be/iyWFulQ7apg?t=1228) of equivocation  
[0:20:30](https://youtu.be/iyWFulQ7apg?t=1230) so if i start having a heart attack  
[0:20:31](https://youtu.be/iyWFulQ7apg?t=1231) right now i'm like is there a doctor in  
[0:20:33](https://youtu.be/iyWFulQ7apg?t=1233) the house  
[0:20:34](https://youtu.be/iyWFulQ7apg?t=1234) and hijab says i'm a doctor and i'm like  
[0:20:36](https://youtu.be/iyWFulQ7apg?t=1236) alright help me i've got a phd in  
[0:20:38](https://youtu.be/iyWFulQ7apg?t=1238) sociology i'll be like  
[0:20:40](https://youtu.be/iyWFulQ7apg?t=1240) no not that doctor medical doctor it's a  
[0:20:42](https://youtu.be/iyWFulQ7apg?t=1242) fallacy of equivocation so  
[0:20:44](https://youtu.be/iyWFulQ7apg?t=1244) repeatedly equating philosophy with  
[0:20:47](https://youtu.be/iyWFulQ7apg?t=1247) kalam  
[0:20:48](https://youtu.be/iyWFulQ7apg?t=1248) is is the very problem right i mean the  
[0:20:51](https://youtu.be/iyWFulQ7apg?t=1251) basic thinking  
[0:20:52](https://youtu.be/iyWFulQ7apg?t=1252) um thinking about thinking something  
[0:20:54](https://youtu.be/iyWFulQ7apg?t=1254) which is very quranic something which is  
[0:20:57](https://youtu.be/iyWFulQ7apg?t=1257) very clear that  
[0:20:58](https://youtu.be/iyWFulQ7apg?t=1258) the muslims were doing uh before for  
[0:21:01](https://youtu.be/iyWFulQ7apg?t=1261) hundreds  
[0:21:02](https://youtu.be/iyWFulQ7apg?t=1262) of years you know quite loosely  
[0:21:05](https://youtu.be/iyWFulQ7apg?t=1265) i said this to hamza the other day yeah  
[0:21:07](https://youtu.be/iyWFulQ7apg?t=1267) certainly you know how darwin  
[0:21:09](https://youtu.be/iyWFulQ7apg?t=1269) sorry dawkins yeah famously said darwin  
[0:21:12](https://youtu.be/iyWFulQ7apg?t=1272) allowed us to be intellectually  
[0:21:13](https://youtu.be/iyWFulQ7apg?t=1273) satisfied atheists yeah  
[0:21:14](https://youtu.be/iyWFulQ7apg?t=1274) i think if some of you have to say the  
[0:21:16](https://youtu.be/iyWFulQ7apg?t=1276) same thing they'd have to say even  
[0:21:18](https://youtu.be/iyWFulQ7apg?t=1278) tamiya made us into like intellectually  
[0:21:20](https://youtu.be/iyWFulQ7apg?t=1280) satisfied  
[0:21:21](https://youtu.be/iyWFulQ7apg?t=1281) selfies and the reason why yes is  
[0:21:23](https://youtu.be/iyWFulQ7apg?t=1283) because he dove  
[0:21:24](https://youtu.be/iyWFulQ7apg?t=1284) yes yes yes i like that i like that  
[0:21:26](https://youtu.be/iyWFulQ7apg?t=1286) think about it i like that look  
[0:21:28](https://youtu.be/iyWFulQ7apg?t=1288) who before even tell me i did what he  
[0:21:30](https://youtu.be/iyWFulQ7apg?t=1290) did uh only ahmed  
[0:21:32](https://youtu.be/iyWFulQ7apg?t=1292) well well absolutely but also after the  
[0:21:34](https://youtu.be/iyWFulQ7apg?t=1294) sahabah yeah  
[0:21:35](https://youtu.be/iyWFulQ7apg?t=1295) yeah so he engaged with it no not only  
[0:21:37](https://youtu.be/iyWFulQ7apg?t=1297) this i mean  
[0:21:38](https://youtu.be/iyWFulQ7apg?t=1298) if we take uh his way his works  
[0:21:41](https://youtu.be/iyWFulQ7apg?t=1301) and we actually rip off the name and  
[0:21:44](https://youtu.be/iyWFulQ7apg?t=1304) just go  
[0:21:45](https://youtu.be/iyWFulQ7apg?t=1305) post it through someone's letterbox um  
[0:21:48](https://youtu.be/iyWFulQ7apg?t=1308) they would  
[0:21:48](https://youtu.be/iyWFulQ7apg?t=1308) actually say this is pure this is pure  
[0:21:51](https://youtu.be/iyWFulQ7apg?t=1311) philosophy  
[0:21:52](https://youtu.be/iyWFulQ7apg?t=1312) bro it's in the philosophy department  
[0:21:53](https://youtu.be/iyWFulQ7apg?t=1313) yeah  
[0:21:56](https://youtu.be/iyWFulQ7apg?t=1316) most universities  
[0:22:01](https://youtu.be/iyWFulQ7apg?t=1321) yeah i see this deep philosophy man from  
[0:22:04](https://youtu.be/iyWFulQ7apg?t=1324) that angle  
[0:22:04](https://youtu.be/iyWFulQ7apg?t=1324) these guys the problem is that even  
[0:22:06](https://youtu.be/iyWFulQ7apg?t=1326) though it is yeah  
[0:22:08](https://youtu.be/iyWFulQ7apg?t=1328) they know what is they don't know what  
[0:22:09](https://youtu.be/iyWFulQ7apg?t=1329) philosophy is yeah and it's very  
[0:22:12](https://youtu.be/iyWFulQ7apg?t=1332) easy to to to to dismiss these things  
[0:22:14](https://youtu.be/iyWFulQ7apg?t=1334) until and this is the thing  
[0:22:16](https://youtu.be/iyWFulQ7apg?t=1336) you your child come back comes back from  
[0:22:19](https://youtu.be/iyWFulQ7apg?t=1339) school and says  
[0:22:20](https://youtu.be/iyWFulQ7apg?t=1340) something and then you're like you know  
[0:22:22](https://youtu.be/iyWFulQ7apg?t=1342) that's what happened they've come to  
[0:22:24](https://youtu.be/iyWFulQ7apg?t=1344) realize that  
[0:22:25](https://youtu.be/iyWFulQ7apg?t=1345) yeah we've been around the country yeah  
[0:22:27](https://youtu.be/iyWFulQ7apg?t=1347) and we've been in other countries that  
[0:22:28](https://youtu.be/iyWFulQ7apg?t=1348) are newest  
[0:22:29](https://youtu.be/iyWFulQ7apg?t=1349) after a couple of years a conservative  
[0:22:32](https://youtu.be/iyWFulQ7apg?t=1352) muslims or everyone call them  
[0:22:33](https://youtu.be/iyWFulQ7apg?t=1353) ultra conservative don't engage with  
[0:22:36](https://youtu.be/iyWFulQ7apg?t=1356) outside whatever  
[0:22:37](https://youtu.be/iyWFulQ7apg?t=1357) however you want to brand them yeah  
[0:22:39](https://youtu.be/iyWFulQ7apg?t=1359) after  
[0:22:41](https://youtu.be/iyWFulQ7apg?t=1361) a while they'll be knocking on your door  
[0:22:43](https://youtu.be/iyWFulQ7apg?t=1363) yeah and that's what happens  
[0:22:45](https://youtu.be/iyWFulQ7apg?t=1365) in the beginning it says two years later  
[0:22:47](https://youtu.be/iyWFulQ7apg?t=1367) they call me and say look  
[0:22:49](https://youtu.be/iyWFulQ7apg?t=1369) my son uh he started saying things like  
[0:22:52](https://youtu.be/iyWFulQ7apg?t=1372) lgbt is not how do we argue with that  
[0:22:56](https://youtu.be/iyWFulQ7apg?t=1376) okay if you ca if you didn't argue with

[0:23:00](https://youtu.be/iyWFulQ7apg?t=1380) five years ago you would have been you  
[0:23:02](https://youtu.be/iyWFulQ7apg?t=1382) would have been fine your son would have  
[0:23:04](https://youtu.be/iyWFulQ7apg?t=1384) i'm not saying your son wouldn't have  
[0:23:05](https://youtu.be/iyWFulQ7apg?t=1385) gone that direction allah but  
[0:23:07](https://youtu.be/iyWFulQ7apg?t=1387) you would have known how to deal with  
[0:23:08](https://youtu.be/iyWFulQ7apg?t=1388) that situation yeah it's the fact that  
[0:23:10](https://youtu.be/iyWFulQ7apg?t=1390) you've wanted to keep yourself  
[0:23:12](https://youtu.be/iyWFulQ7apg?t=1392) ignorant on something that is so  
[0:23:13](https://youtu.be/iyWFulQ7apg?t=1393) pertinent that has made you  
[0:23:15](https://youtu.be/iyWFulQ7apg?t=1395) fail in this industry it's kind of like  
[0:23:18](https://youtu.be/iyWFulQ7apg?t=1398) this you know  
[0:23:19](https://youtu.be/iyWFulQ7apg?t=1399) um some muslim parents and we're both  
[0:23:21](https://youtu.be/iyWFulQ7apg?t=1401) parents now  
[0:23:22](https://youtu.be/iyWFulQ7apg?t=1402) uh you know they think okay when my  
[0:23:24](https://youtu.be/iyWFulQ7apg?t=1404) child's a teenager i'm not gonna tell  
[0:23:25](https://youtu.be/iyWFulQ7apg?t=1405) them about anything that's out there  
[0:23:27](https://youtu.be/iyWFulQ7apg?t=1407) you know i'm just gonna shelter them as  
[0:23:29](https://youtu.be/iyWFulQ7apg?t=1409) if they won't find out as if they don't  
[0:23:31](https://youtu.be/iyWFulQ7apg?t=1411) know  
[0:23:31](https://youtu.be/iyWFulQ7apg?t=1411) as if you know that they live in some  
[0:23:34](https://youtu.be/iyWFulQ7apg?t=1414) sort of cocoon  
[0:23:36](https://youtu.be/iyWFulQ7apg?t=1416) you have to be able to vaccinate against  
[0:23:38](https://youtu.be/iyWFulQ7apg?t=1418) against these very ideas  
[0:23:40](https://youtu.be/iyWFulQ7apg?t=1420) and the other thing is that look  
[0:23:41](https://youtu.be/iyWFulQ7apg?t=1421) sapience institute the aim  
[0:23:44](https://youtu.be/iyWFulQ7apg?t=1424) is like you said we want to have a  
[0:23:46](https://youtu.be/iyWFulQ7apg?t=1426) library we want to have  
[0:23:47](https://youtu.be/iyWFulQ7apg?t=1427) a a catalog of okay so we have this  
[0:23:51](https://youtu.be/iyWFulQ7apg?t=1431) particular doubt  
[0:23:52](https://youtu.be/iyWFulQ7apg?t=1432) this is how it's been refuted and the  
[0:23:55](https://youtu.be/iyWFulQ7apg?t=1435) powerful thing about this  
[0:23:56](https://youtu.be/iyWFulQ7apg?t=1436) this methodology is it's sort of  
[0:23:59](https://youtu.be/iyWFulQ7apg?t=1439) crowdsourced as well so it's not just  
[0:24:01](https://youtu.be/iyWFulQ7apg?t=1441) simply the case of  
[0:24:02](https://youtu.be/iyWFulQ7apg?t=1442) okay so hijab hamza iran yusuf ponders  
[0:24:06](https://youtu.be/iyWFulQ7apg?t=1446) let's just go out there develop this  
[0:24:07](https://youtu.be/iyWFulQ7apg?t=1447) stuff all of you guys watching martial

[0:24:18](https://youtu.be/iyWFulQ7apg?t=1458) well and we can actually see okay so  
[0:24:20](https://youtu.be/iyWFulQ7apg?t=1460) here's a problem  
[0:24:21](https://youtu.be/iyWFulQ7apg?t=1461) here's a novel solution does it actually  
[0:24:23](https://youtu.be/iyWFulQ7apg?t=1463) work can we actually apply  
[0:24:25](https://youtu.be/iyWFulQ7apg?t=1465) now let's delve into some of the videos  
[0:24:27](https://youtu.be/iyWFulQ7apg?t=1467) that you've been um  
[0:24:28](https://youtu.be/iyWFulQ7apg?t=1468) uh working on because it relates to this  
[0:24:30](https://youtu.be/iyWFulQ7apg?t=1470) uh some of the comments that are coming  
[0:24:32](https://youtu.be/iyWFulQ7apg?t=1472) in  
[0:24:32](https://youtu.be/iyWFulQ7apg?t=1472) so there's a muslim who says i am a  
[0:24:35](https://youtu.be/iyWFulQ7apg?t=1475) muslim  
[0:24:36](https://youtu.be/iyWFulQ7apg?t=1476) who believes the earth is flat according  
[0:24:38](https://youtu.be/iyWFulQ7apg?t=1478) to the quran  
[0:24:39](https://youtu.be/iyWFulQ7apg?t=1479) and there are some muslims in the gulf  
[0:24:41](https://youtu.be/iyWFulQ7apg?t=1481) who believe the earth is flat  
[0:24:43](https://youtu.be/iyWFulQ7apg?t=1483) and so his perspective is it's not just  
[0:24:46](https://youtu.be/iyWFulQ7apg?t=1486) that he believes it  
[0:24:48](https://youtu.be/iyWFulQ7apg?t=1488) he believes it's also a quranic paradigm  
[0:24:50](https://youtu.be/iyWFulQ7apg?t=1490) so this is something that you've  
[0:24:52](https://youtu.be/iyWFulQ7apg?t=1492) uh tackled in the past and it's  
[0:24:54](https://youtu.be/iyWFulQ7apg?t=1494) something that atheists use against us  
[0:24:56](https://youtu.be/iyWFulQ7apg?t=1496) as well but some muslims believe  
[0:24:57](https://youtu.be/iyWFulQ7apg?t=1497) the earth island even in fact right now  
[0:24:59](https://youtu.be/iyWFulQ7apg?t=1499) some westerners and non-muslims  
[0:25:01](https://youtu.be/iyWFulQ7apg?t=1501) they're actually starting to hold this  
[0:25:02](https://youtu.be/iyWFulQ7apg?t=1502) view as well but how would you address  
[0:25:04](https://youtu.be/iyWFulQ7apg?t=1504) this point that  
[0:25:05](https://youtu.be/iyWFulQ7apg?t=1505) the quran supports a flat earth  
[0:25:09](https://youtu.be/iyWFulQ7apg?t=1509) yeah look having the belief that the  
[0:25:11](https://youtu.be/iyWFulQ7apg?t=1511) earth is flat it's not coffee  
[0:25:13](https://youtu.be/iyWFulQ7apg?t=1513) because you can interpret some of the  
[0:25:14](https://youtu.be/iyWFulQ7apg?t=1514) verses to mean that the entire  
[0:25:17](https://youtu.be/iyWFulQ7apg?t=1517) entire globe is is flat if you really  
[0:25:19](https://youtu.be/iyWFulQ7apg?t=1519) wanted to do that and it's not kufri  
[0:25:21](https://youtu.be/iyWFulQ7apg?t=1521) so long as it's not something which  
[0:25:22](https://youtu.be/iyWFulQ7apg?t=1522) takes you out of the fold of islam  
[0:25:24](https://youtu.be/iyWFulQ7apg?t=1524) because the the wording in the quran is  
[0:25:27](https://youtu.be/iyWFulQ7apg?t=1527) not  
[0:25:28](https://youtu.be/iyWFulQ7apg?t=1528) uh so explicit and  
[0:25:32](https://youtu.be/iyWFulQ7apg?t=1532) uh that it would require it would take  
[0:25:34](https://youtu.be/iyWFulQ7apg?t=1534) someone out of islam if you believe that  
[0:25:36](https://youtu.be/iyWFulQ7apg?t=1536) and and evidence of that is that there  
[0:25:38](https://youtu.be/iyWFulQ7apg?t=1538) have been  
[0:25:39](https://youtu.be/iyWFulQ7apg?t=1539) some scholars in the past who have  
[0:25:41](https://youtu.be/iyWFulQ7apg?t=1541) believed that the earth is flat and i  
[0:25:43](https://youtu.be/iyWFulQ7apg?t=1543) think al-qaeda is one of them actually  
[0:25:45](https://youtu.be/iyWFulQ7apg?t=1545) yeah he believed that he asked i  
[0:25:46](https://youtu.be/iyWFulQ7apg?t=1546) remember reading his tafsir he believed  
[0:25:48](https://youtu.be/iyWFulQ7apg?t=1548) that the earth was flat  
[0:25:50](https://youtu.be/iyWFulQ7apg?t=1550) he's a major scholar uh but i would say  
[0:25:53](https://youtu.be/iyWFulQ7apg?t=1553) probably the majority especially  
[0:25:54](https://youtu.be/iyWFulQ7apg?t=1554) when dealing with less of jesus did not  
[0:25:56](https://youtu.be/iyWFulQ7apg?t=1556) believe that so josie didn't believe  
[0:25:57](https://youtu.be/iyWFulQ7apg?t=1557) that  
[0:25:58](https://youtu.be/iyWFulQ7apg?t=1558) and he said uh obviously if he hasn't  
[0:26:01](https://youtu.be/iyWFulQ7apg?t=1561) didn't believe that  
[0:26:03](https://youtu.be/iyWFulQ7apg?t=1563) he didn't believe that he didn't believe  
[0:26:05](https://youtu.be/iyWFulQ7apg?t=1565) that he didn't believe that even samia  
[0:26:07](https://youtu.be/iyWFulQ7apg?t=1567) does ishmael and he he went back to  
[0:26:10](https://youtu.be/iyWFulQ7apg?t=1570) ahmadinejad and his students and said  
[0:26:11](https://youtu.be/iyWFulQ7apg?t=1571) that they believed that as well that it  
[0:26:13](https://youtu.be/iyWFulQ7apg?t=1573) was round  
[0:26:15](https://youtu.be/iyWFulQ7apg?t=1575) so and they and a lot of these  
[0:26:17](https://youtu.be/iyWFulQ7apg?t=1577) individuals they use  
[0:26:18](https://youtu.be/iyWFulQ7apg?t=1578) the quran  
[0:26:37](https://youtu.be/iyWFulQ7apg?t=1597) is going around something which is uh  
[0:26:39](https://youtu.be/iyWFulQ7apg?t=1599) around  
[0:26:40](https://youtu.be/iyWFulQ7apg?t=1600) that's why that's what the implication  
[0:26:42](https://youtu.be/iyWFulQ7apg?t=1602) is and so i think the evidence is pretty  
[0:26:44](https://youtu.be/iyWFulQ7apg?t=1604) strong that it's around in the quran  
[0:26:46](https://youtu.be/iyWFulQ7apg?t=1606) from this verse alone but if you want to  
[0:26:48](https://youtu.be/iyWFulQ7apg?t=1608) believe it's flat i'm not  
[0:26:50](https://youtu.be/iyWFulQ7apg?t=1610) to each their own and it's not uh a  
[0:26:52](https://youtu.be/iyWFulQ7apg?t=1612) coffee belief  
[0:26:53](https://youtu.be/iyWFulQ7apg?t=1613) but what what if what if somebody says  
[0:26:56](https://youtu.be/iyWFulQ7apg?t=1616) this is the quranic paradigm  
[0:26:58](https://youtu.be/iyWFulQ7apg?t=1618) you can't say it i just like i said you  
[0:27:00](https://youtu.be/iyWFulQ7apg?t=1620) can you can believe  
[0:27:01](https://youtu.be/iyWFulQ7apg?t=1621) it's flat and have the quran to  
[0:27:04](https://youtu.be/iyWFulQ7apg?t=1624) uh to try and support what you believe  
[0:27:07](https://youtu.be/iyWFulQ7apg?t=1627) but you have to allow that for other  
[0:27:08](https://youtu.be/iyWFulQ7apg?t=1628) people as well  
[0:27:09](https://youtu.be/iyWFulQ7apg?t=1629) yeah what are you going to say to  
[0:27:11](https://youtu.be/iyWFulQ7apg?t=1631) medieval scholars  
[0:27:13](https://youtu.be/iyWFulQ7apg?t=1633) i mean the flat earth move movement that  
[0:27:16](https://youtu.be/iyWFulQ7apg?t=1636) they're saying is a conspiracy  
[0:27:17](https://youtu.be/iyWFulQ7apg?t=1637) from mine to say i'm not an expert in  
[0:27:20](https://youtu.be/iyWFulQ7apg?t=1640) the flat earth movement  
[0:27:21](https://youtu.be/iyWFulQ7apg?t=1641) it's a conspiracy and this and that and  
[0:27:23](https://youtu.be/iyWFulQ7apg?t=1643) all of that yeah  
[0:27:24](https://youtu.be/iyWFulQ7apg?t=1644) well how could it be a conspiracy for  
[0:27:26](https://youtu.be/iyWFulQ7apg?t=1646) the pre  
[0:27:28](https://youtu.be/iyWFulQ7apg?t=1648) enlightenment individuals it's not  
[0:27:29](https://youtu.be/iyWFulQ7apg?t=1649) conspiracy for it for them no  
[0:27:31](https://youtu.be/iyWFulQ7apg?t=1651) would you respect it's not it's not  
[0:27:32](https://youtu.be/iyWFulQ7apg?t=1652) because  
[0:27:42](https://youtu.be/iyWFulQ7apg?t=1662) so it's not like there was a grand  
[0:27:44](https://youtu.be/iyWFulQ7apg?t=1664) conspiracy of collusion  
[0:27:45](https://youtu.be/iyWFulQ7apg?t=1665) for a thousand four hundred years of  
[0:27:47](https://youtu.be/iyWFulQ7apg?t=1667) islamic history yeah  
[0:27:48](https://youtu.be/iyWFulQ7apg?t=1668) if if you wanna say that uh there's no  
[0:27:52](https://youtu.be/iyWFulQ7apg?t=1672) other interpretation except for that the  
[0:27:54](https://youtu.be/iyWFulQ7apg?t=1674) uh the earth is flat this is clearly  
[0:27:56](https://youtu.be/iyWFulQ7apg?t=1676) false it's it's just  
[0:27:57](https://youtu.be/iyWFulQ7apg?t=1677) historically false it's not even a  
[0:28:00](https://youtu.be/iyWFulQ7apg?t=1680) matter of uh uh opinion or would respect  
[0:28:04](https://youtu.be/iyWFulQ7apg?t=1684) is  
[0:28:04](https://youtu.be/iyWFulQ7apg?t=1684) is historically false because people  
[0:28:06](https://youtu.be/iyWFulQ7apg?t=1686) before the age before america became a  
[0:28:08](https://youtu.be/iyWFulQ7apg?t=1688) superpower  
[0:28:09](https://youtu.be/iyWFulQ7apg?t=1689) before the nasa even had spacecrafts  
[0:28:12](https://youtu.be/iyWFulQ7apg?t=1692) wherever before whatever conspiracy you  
[0:28:14](https://youtu.be/iyWFulQ7apg?t=1694) think happened happened  
[0:28:16](https://youtu.be/iyWFulQ7apg?t=1696) people were saying that the earth was  
[0:28:17](https://youtu.be/iyWFulQ7apg?t=1697) wrong from the muslim world and they  
[0:28:18](https://youtu.be/iyWFulQ7apg?t=1698) were using verse in the quran so  
[0:28:20](https://youtu.be/iyWFulQ7apg?t=1700) you can't say that the only opinion just  
[0:28:22](https://youtu.be/iyWFulQ7apg?t=1702) like i can't say the only opinion is  
[0:28:24](https://youtu.be/iyWFulQ7apg?t=1704) therefore is wrong maybe there's a few  
[0:28:25](https://youtu.be/iyWFulQ7apg?t=1705) opinions that said the f is flat yeah  
[0:28:26](https://youtu.be/iyWFulQ7apg?t=1706) fine i've just said  
[0:28:28](https://youtu.be/iyWFulQ7apg?t=1708) one of them i'm not aware of that that  
[0:28:29](https://youtu.be/iyWFulQ7apg?t=1709) many of them yeah  
[0:28:31](https://youtu.be/iyWFulQ7apg?t=1711) but um yeah to each their own i mean  
[0:28:34](https://youtu.be/iyWFulQ7apg?t=1714) it's not a coffee thing i won't worry  
[0:28:36](https://youtu.be/iyWFulQ7apg?t=1716) about it's not something which i believe  
[0:28:37](https://youtu.be/iyWFulQ7apg?t=1717) takes you out of the fold of islam  
[0:28:39](https://youtu.be/iyWFulQ7apg?t=1719) yeah for that i mean while you were  
[0:28:42](https://youtu.be/iyWFulQ7apg?t=1722) speaking  
[0:28:43](https://youtu.be/iyWFulQ7apg?t=1723) we actually had a lot more questions  
[0:28:45](https://youtu.be/iyWFulQ7apg?t=1725) coming in i'd like to send me the link i  
[0:28:47](https://youtu.be/iyWFulQ7apg?t=1727) can put it on the community  
[0:28:48](https://youtu.be/iyWFulQ7apg?t=1728) yes i'll do that now  
[0:28:58](https://youtu.be/iyWFulQ7apg?t=1738) right here questions um so  
[0:29:01](https://youtu.be/iyWFulQ7apg?t=1741) at the beginning um uh you know we we  
[0:29:04](https://youtu.be/iyWFulQ7apg?t=1744) mentioned  
[0:29:05](https://youtu.be/iyWFulQ7apg?t=1745) about obviously the um  
[0:29:10](https://youtu.be/iyWFulQ7apg?t=1750) you know the various topics that uh you  
[0:29:13](https://youtu.be/iyWFulQ7apg?t=1753) know we've been making videos about  
[0:29:15](https://youtu.be/iyWFulQ7apg?t=1755) and there's one thing that comes up  
[0:29:16](https://youtu.be/iyWFulQ7apg?t=1756) repeatedly um  
[0:29:18](https://youtu.be/iyWFulQ7apg?t=1758) that's been used by the atheist which is  
[0:29:20](https://youtu.be/iyWFulQ7apg?t=1760) about the sun  
[0:29:22](https://youtu.be/iyWFulQ7apg?t=1762) having its um uh so not the sun  
[0:29:26](https://youtu.be/iyWFulQ7apg?t=1766) the uh the stars being uh  
[0:29:29](https://youtu.be/iyWFulQ7apg?t=1769) you know shooting at the devils and how  
[0:29:32](https://youtu.be/iyWFulQ7apg?t=1772) this is unscientific  
[0:29:34](https://youtu.be/iyWFulQ7apg?t=1774) and how this is um irrational so can you  
[0:29:37](https://youtu.be/iyWFulQ7apg?t=1777) summarize that video  
[0:29:39](https://youtu.be/iyWFulQ7apg?t=1779) um because i think that's the topic  
[0:29:41](https://youtu.be/iyWFulQ7apg?t=1781) which  
[0:29:42](https://youtu.be/iyWFulQ7apg?t=1782) uh the way alhamdulillah that you  
[0:29:44](https://youtu.be/iyWFulQ7apg?t=1784) addressed it in that video i haven't  
[0:29:46](https://youtu.be/iyWFulQ7apg?t=1786) heard it addressed  
[0:29:47](https://youtu.be/iyWFulQ7apg?t=1787) like that before and i also feel that  
[0:29:51](https://youtu.be/iyWFulQ7apg?t=1791) the the very answer exposes  
[0:29:55](https://youtu.be/iyWFulQ7apg?t=1795) the questioner when it comes to you know  
[0:29:58](https://youtu.be/iyWFulQ7apg?t=1798) this contention that's thrown out it  
[0:29:59](https://youtu.be/iyWFulQ7apg?t=1799) just shows  
[0:30:00](https://youtu.be/iyWFulQ7apg?t=1800) the multiple layers of mistakes that  
[0:30:02](https://youtu.be/iyWFulQ7apg?t=1802) they actually make in even raising  
[0:30:04](https://youtu.be/iyWFulQ7apg?t=1804) uh such a question i don't even know why  
[0:30:06](https://youtu.be/iyWFulQ7apg?t=1806) they would respect  
[0:30:08](https://youtu.be/iyWFulQ7apg?t=1808) here and i don't even i don't even get  
[0:30:10](https://youtu.be/iyWFulQ7apg?t=1810) why this is a contention and  
[0:30:12](https://youtu.be/iyWFulQ7apg?t=1812) i don't think to be honest it's a  
[0:30:14](https://youtu.be/iyWFulQ7apg?t=1814) contention that many muslims take  
[0:30:15](https://youtu.be/iyWFulQ7apg?t=1815) seriously  
[0:30:16](https://youtu.be/iyWFulQ7apg?t=1816) but because some of these anti-muslim  
[0:30:18](https://youtu.be/iyWFulQ7apg?t=1818) apologies have brought up in the  
[0:30:20](https://youtu.be/iyWFulQ7apg?t=1820) last i don't know what it is it's  
[0:30:22](https://youtu.be/iyWFulQ7apg?t=1822) started to be uh  
[0:30:24](https://youtu.be/iyWFulQ7apg?t=1824) discussed but like one of the main  
[0:30:26](https://youtu.be/iyWFulQ7apg?t=1826) issues i've done i put on the community  
[0:30:27](https://youtu.be/iyWFulQ7apg?t=1827) but  
[0:30:28](https://youtu.be/iyWFulQ7apg?t=1828) okay brilliant yeah one of the main  
[0:30:30](https://youtu.be/iyWFulQ7apg?t=1830) issues is it's a category mistake  
[0:30:31](https://youtu.be/iyWFulQ7apg?t=1831) fallacy  
[0:30:32](https://youtu.be/iyWFulQ7apg?t=1832) like i'm starting to see some really  
[0:30:35](https://youtu.be/iyWFulQ7apg?t=1835) stupid things  
[0:30:37](https://youtu.be/iyWFulQ7apg?t=1837) from the anti-muslim apologetics like  
[0:30:40](https://youtu.be/iyWFulQ7apg?t=1840) when the quran and the sunnah are  
[0:30:42](https://youtu.be/iyWFulQ7apg?t=1842) clearly talking about metaphysical  
[0:30:44](https://youtu.be/iyWFulQ7apg?t=1844) things  
[0:30:45](https://youtu.be/iyWFulQ7apg?t=1845) they they somehow call this unscientific  
[0:30:48](https://youtu.be/iyWFulQ7apg?t=1848) yeah  
[0:30:49](https://youtu.be/iyWFulQ7apg?t=1849) what's that got to do with science like  
[0:30:51](https://youtu.be/iyWFulQ7apg?t=1851) it's it's clearly  
[0:30:54](https://youtu.be/iyWFulQ7apg?t=1854) beyond science it's clearly not meant to  
[0:30:56](https://youtu.be/iyWFulQ7apg?t=1856) be scientific yeah  
[0:30:57](https://youtu.be/iyWFulQ7apg?t=1857) i mean even if we consult david humes  
[0:30:59](https://youtu.be/iyWFulQ7apg?t=1859) i'd um question a  
[0:31:01](https://youtu.be/iyWFulQ7apg?t=1861) definition of what a miracle is yep  
[0:31:03](https://youtu.be/iyWFulQ7apg?t=1863) something which is outside the  
[0:31:04](https://youtu.be/iyWFulQ7apg?t=1864) scope of natural law or whatever he said  
[0:31:06](https://youtu.be/iyWFulQ7apg?t=1866) it was these things are intended to be  
[0:31:08](https://youtu.be/iyWFulQ7apg?t=1868) like that  
[0:31:10](https://youtu.be/iyWFulQ7apg?t=1870) so there's a category now of mistakes or  
[0:31:13](https://youtu.be/iyWFulQ7apg?t=1873) that  
[0:31:13](https://youtu.be/iyWFulQ7apg?t=1873) how could it be possible that the sea  
[0:31:15](https://youtu.be/iyWFulQ7apg?t=1875) was split into two how could it be  
[0:31:16](https://youtu.be/iyWFulQ7apg?t=1876) possible that the moon split or  
[0:31:20](https://youtu.be/iyWFulQ7apg?t=1880) all of these things which are  
[0:31:22](https://youtu.be/iyWFulQ7apg?t=1882) necessarily intended  
[0:31:23](https://youtu.be/iyWFulQ7apg?t=1883) to be uh miracles something which is  
[0:31:25](https://youtu.be/iyWFulQ7apg?t=1885) metaphysical  
[0:31:27](https://youtu.be/iyWFulQ7apg?t=1887) they're saying it's unscientific when  
[0:31:30](https://youtu.be/iyWFulQ7apg?t=1890) basic philosophy of science student will  
[0:31:32](https://youtu.be/iyWFulQ7apg?t=1892) tell you  
[0:31:33](https://youtu.be/iyWFulQ7apg?t=1893) as you'll know more than me actually is  
[0:31:34](https://youtu.be/iyWFulQ7apg?t=1894) that you know it's a methodological  
[0:31:36](https://youtu.be/iyWFulQ7apg?t=1896) naturalism  
[0:31:37](https://youtu.be/iyWFulQ7apg?t=1897) uh and so with a methodological natural  
[0:31:39](https://youtu.be/iyWFulQ7apg?t=1899) science  
[0:31:40](https://youtu.be/iyWFulQ7apg?t=1900) is based on that with methodological  
[0:31:42](https://youtu.be/iyWFulQ7apg?t=1902) naturalism and therefore  
[0:31:44](https://youtu.be/iyWFulQ7apg?t=1904) um anything is not that anything outside  
[0:31:46](https://youtu.be/iyWFulQ7apg?t=1906) of that naturalism is not going to be  
[0:31:48](https://youtu.be/iyWFulQ7apg?t=1908) included in that by definition yeah so  
[0:31:50](https://youtu.be/iyWFulQ7apg?t=1910) all these miracles and stuff  
[0:31:52](https://youtu.be/iyWFulQ7apg?t=1912) like that's got nothing to do it's got  
[0:31:54](https://youtu.be/iyWFulQ7apg?t=1914) nothing to do with science  
[0:31:55](https://youtu.be/iyWFulQ7apg?t=1915) yeah it's not like the the author of the  
[0:31:57](https://youtu.be/iyWFulQ7apg?t=1917) quran whoever they think  
[0:31:58](https://youtu.be/iyWFulQ7apg?t=1918) is yeah was not aware of that they were  
[0:32:01](https://youtu.be/iyWFulQ7apg?t=1921) intentionally trying to  
[0:32:03](https://youtu.be/iyWFulQ7apg?t=1923) yeah project that so or present that so  
[0:32:06](https://youtu.be/iyWFulQ7apg?t=1926) this is what i think is  
[0:32:07](https://youtu.be/iyWFulQ7apg?t=1927) is problematic and i just feel like it's  
[0:32:09](https://youtu.be/iyWFulQ7apg?t=1929) so  
[0:32:11](https://youtu.be/iyWFulQ7apg?t=1931) this is there's a misattribute  
[0:32:13](https://youtu.be/iyWFulQ7apg?t=1933) misattributed quote to albert einstein  
[0:32:15](https://youtu.be/iyWFulQ7apg?t=1935) it's not actually a true quote  
[0:32:17](https://youtu.be/iyWFulQ7apg?t=1937) where he said insanity is doing the same  
[0:32:19](https://youtu.be/iyWFulQ7apg?t=1939) thing over and over again and expecting  
[0:32:21](https://youtu.be/iyWFulQ7apg?t=1941) a different result  
[0:32:22](https://youtu.be/iyWFulQ7apg?t=1942) it sounds good but it's not from albert  
[0:32:23](https://youtu.be/iyWFulQ7apg?t=1943) einstein it's misattribute but this is  
[0:32:25](https://youtu.be/iyWFulQ7apg?t=1945) what if if it is if there is some  
[0:32:27](https://youtu.be/iyWFulQ7apg?t=1947) element of truth in that definition  
[0:32:28](https://youtu.be/iyWFulQ7apg?t=1948) which i don't think  
[0:32:29](https://youtu.be/iyWFulQ7apg?t=1949) is fully coherent but this is what  
[0:32:32](https://youtu.be/iyWFulQ7apg?t=1952) they're doing they're continuing  
[0:32:33](https://youtu.be/iyWFulQ7apg?t=1953) the same hair that i had 20 years ago 30  
[0:32:36](https://youtu.be/iyWFulQ7apg?t=1956) years ago  
[0:32:37](https://youtu.be/iyWFulQ7apg?t=1957) and they're expecting a different result  
[0:32:39](https://youtu.be/iyWFulQ7apg?t=1959) these  
[0:32:40](https://youtu.be/iyWFulQ7apg?t=1960) these ones are the weakest ones like  
[0:32:42](https://youtu.be/iyWFulQ7apg?t=1962) when you're when you're getting we're  
[0:32:42](https://youtu.be/iyWFulQ7apg?t=1962) talking about the  
[0:32:43](https://youtu.be/iyWFulQ7apg?t=1963) bloody uh meteorite and uh  
[0:32:46](https://youtu.be/iyWFulQ7apg?t=1966) sorry to say the devil and you think  
[0:32:48](https://youtu.be/iyWFulQ7apg?t=1968) people are gonna leave islam because of  
[0:32:50](https://youtu.be/iyWFulQ7apg?t=1970) that  
[0:32:50](https://youtu.be/iyWFulQ7apg?t=1970) like is that your best shot yeah when i  
[0:32:52](https://youtu.be/iyWFulQ7apg?t=1972) was talking to apus  
[0:32:54](https://youtu.be/iyWFulQ7apg?t=1974) on on the live stream that was the first  
[0:32:56](https://youtu.be/iyWFulQ7apg?t=1976) thing he brought up  
[0:32:57](https://youtu.be/iyWFulQ7apg?t=1977) like is that you really the strongest  
[0:32:59](https://youtu.be/iyWFulQ7apg?t=1979) thing you have you this thing probably  
[0:33:01](https://youtu.be/iyWFulQ7apg?t=1981) got millions of views i don't know how  
[0:33:02](https://youtu.be/iyWFulQ7apg?t=1982) many views it got all together like if  
[0:33:04](https://youtu.be/iyWFulQ7apg?t=1984) you think about  
[0:33:04](https://youtu.be/iyWFulQ7apg?t=1984) adam sales uh podcast channel on my  
[0:33:07](https://youtu.be/iyWFulQ7apg?t=1987) channel his channel probably got about a  
[0:33:08](https://youtu.be/iyWFulQ7apg?t=1988) million views all together or something  
[0:33:09](https://youtu.be/iyWFulQ7apg?t=1989) like that or if not close to it  
[0:33:11](https://youtu.be/iyWFulQ7apg?t=1991) and you had a chance to present your  
[0:33:14](https://youtu.be/iyWFulQ7apg?t=1994) strongest argument the first thing you  
[0:33:15](https://youtu.be/iyWFulQ7apg?t=1995) brought  
[0:33:16](https://youtu.be/iyWFulQ7apg?t=1996) was to uh it says in the quran  
[0:33:19](https://youtu.be/iyWFulQ7apg?t=1999) that the meteorites or the solar flares  
[0:33:22](https://youtu.be/iyWFulQ7apg?t=2002) are attacking the the  
[0:33:24](https://youtu.be/iyWFulQ7apg?t=2004) devils or whatever it is that he said  
[0:33:25](https://youtu.be/iyWFulQ7apg?t=2005) how could this be scientific  
[0:33:27](https://youtu.be/iyWFulQ7apg?t=2007) like really like you have a chance to  
[0:33:30](https://youtu.be/iyWFulQ7apg?t=2010) disprove islam you're  
[0:33:31](https://youtu.be/iyWFulQ7apg?t=2011) you've got and this is the first is that  
[0:33:33](https://youtu.be/iyWFulQ7apg?t=2013) seriously that  
[0:33:35](https://youtu.be/iyWFulQ7apg?t=2015) that actually gives me and i think  
[0:33:37](https://youtu.be/iyWFulQ7apg?t=2017) millions of muslims worldwide a lot of  
[0:33:39](https://youtu.be/iyWFulQ7apg?t=2019) confidence in islam  
[0:33:40](https://youtu.be/iyWFulQ7apg?t=2020) absolutely absolutely and i i think what  
[0:33:42](https://youtu.be/iyWFulQ7apg?t=2022) we want to do next  
[0:33:43](https://youtu.be/iyWFulQ7apg?t=2023) is um and this this part of the process  
[0:33:46](https://youtu.be/iyWFulQ7apg?t=2026) i really want to manage well because i  
[0:33:49](https://youtu.be/iyWFulQ7apg?t=2029) have done this in the past and  
[0:33:51](https://youtu.be/iyWFulQ7apg?t=2031) i really have to uh put my foot down  
[0:33:54](https://youtu.be/iyWFulQ7apg?t=2034) sometimes  
[0:33:55](https://youtu.be/iyWFulQ7apg?t=2035) um we're going to be inviting people to  
[0:33:57](https://youtu.be/iyWFulQ7apg?t=2037) the live stream  
[0:33:58](https://youtu.be/iyWFulQ7apg?t=2038) but the point of coming on the live  
[0:34:00](https://youtu.be/iyWFulQ7apg?t=2040) stream is not to say oh i love mohammed  
[0:34:02](https://youtu.be/iyWFulQ7apg?t=2042) hijab yeah we don't need that  
[0:34:04](https://youtu.be/iyWFulQ7apg?t=2044) that's the one if you don't want to do  
[0:34:06](https://youtu.be/iyWFulQ7apg?t=2046) that then please don't come on the live  
[0:34:07](https://youtu.be/iyWFulQ7apg?t=2047) stream  
[0:34:07](https://youtu.be/iyWFulQ7apg?t=2047) so if you come on a live stream  
[0:34:10](https://youtu.be/iyWFulQ7apg?t=2050) just if you have a question for sapience  
[0:34:13](https://youtu.be/iyWFulQ7apg?t=2053) institute to actually answer  
[0:34:16](https://youtu.be/iyWFulQ7apg?t=2056) um please join the live stream and the  
[0:34:18](https://youtu.be/iyWFulQ7apg?t=2058) reason also is when i normally  
[0:34:20](https://youtu.be/iyWFulQ7apg?t=2060) put the link the room gets bombarded we  
[0:34:22](https://youtu.be/iyWFulQ7apg?t=2062) can only let in 10 people in the studio  
[0:34:24](https://youtu.be/iyWFulQ7apg?t=2064) that's the limit and anybody that joins  
[0:34:25](https://youtu.be/iyWFulQ7apg?t=2065) after 10  
[0:34:26](https://youtu.be/iyWFulQ7apg?t=2066) they get booted out automatically we've  
[0:34:29](https://youtu.be/iyWFulQ7apg?t=2069) had non-muslims in the past who have  
[0:34:31](https://youtu.be/iyWFulQ7apg?t=2071) joined the live stream  
[0:34:32](https://youtu.be/iyWFulQ7apg?t=2072) and because the muslims were there and  
[0:34:34](https://youtu.be/iyWFulQ7apg?t=2074) some of the muslims just wanted to say  
[0:34:36](https://youtu.be/iyWFulQ7apg?t=2076) oh we love you know this person oh this  
[0:34:38](https://youtu.be/iyWFulQ7apg?t=2078) is fine you can say that brother why are  
[0:34:40](https://youtu.be/iyWFulQ7apg?t=2080) you making it  
[0:34:41](https://youtu.be/iyWFulQ7apg?t=2081) so please anybody with questions we're  
[0:34:44](https://youtu.be/iyWFulQ7apg?t=2084) going to be  
[0:34:44](https://youtu.be/iyWFulQ7apg?t=2084) putting the link there and answering  
[0:34:48](https://youtu.be/iyWFulQ7apg?t=2088) your questions and of course we love to  
[0:34:49](https://youtu.be/iyWFulQ7apg?t=2089) hear from the audience and we you know  
[0:34:51](https://youtu.be/iyWFulQ7apg?t=2091) uh we want to interact as much as  
[0:34:53](https://youtu.be/iyWFulQ7apg?t=2093) possible but keep in mind we want to  
[0:34:55](https://youtu.be/iyWFulQ7apg?t=2095) give priority to obviously people who  
[0:34:56](https://youtu.be/iyWFulQ7apg?t=2096) have  
[0:34:57](https://youtu.be/iyWFulQ7apg?t=2097) questions you know i forget that  
[0:35:00](https://youtu.be/iyWFulQ7apg?t=2100) um the essence of what we want to do  
[0:35:04](https://youtu.be/iyWFulQ7apg?t=2104) is um what we want to do is  
[0:35:08](https://youtu.be/iyWFulQ7apg?t=2108) we want to be able to answer questions  
[0:35:10](https://youtu.be/iyWFulQ7apg?t=2110) and

[0:35:34](https://youtu.be/iyWFulQ7apg?t=2134) questions

[0:36:10](https://youtu.be/iyWFulQ7apg?t=2170) uh there are no uh there is  
[0:36:14](https://youtu.be/iyWFulQ7apg?t=2174) probably no historical records uh to  
[0:36:17](https://youtu.be/iyWFulQ7apg?t=2177) suggest that  
[0:36:18](https://youtu.be/iyWFulQ7apg?t=2178) this happened like uh  
[0:36:21](https://youtu.be/iyWFulQ7apg?t=2181) not outside arabia or something like  
[0:36:23](https://youtu.be/iyWFulQ7apg?t=2183) that and  
[0:36:24](https://youtu.be/iyWFulQ7apg?t=2184) also if this happened uh the  
[0:36:27](https://youtu.be/iyWFulQ7apg?t=2187) astronomical  
[0:36:28](https://youtu.be/iyWFulQ7apg?t=2188) people who are in different parts of the  
[0:36:30](https://youtu.be/iyWFulQ7apg?t=2190) world they didn't  
[0:36:34](https://youtu.be/iyWFulQ7apg?t=2194) the people who used to do astronomy in  
[0:36:36](https://youtu.be/iyWFulQ7apg?t=2196) fifth and sixth centuries  
[0:36:38](https://youtu.be/iyWFulQ7apg?t=2198) they also didn't talk about something  
[0:36:40](https://youtu.be/iyWFulQ7apg?t=2200) like this happening  
[0:36:43](https://youtu.be/iyWFulQ7apg?t=2203) so in terms of both science observation  
[0:36:46](https://youtu.be/iyWFulQ7apg?t=2206) and  
[0:36:47](https://youtu.be/iyWFulQ7apg?t=2207) also in terms of historical  
[0:36:50](https://youtu.be/iyWFulQ7apg?t=2210) record how to confirm that this miracle  
[0:36:54](https://youtu.be/iyWFulQ7apg?t=2214) happened  
[0:36:56](https://youtu.be/iyWFulQ7apg?t=2216) yeah so  
[0:37:00](https://youtu.be/iyWFulQ7apg?t=2220) jim first and foremost so if someone  
[0:37:02](https://youtu.be/iyWFulQ7apg?t=2222) says to you there is no evidence of  
[0:37:04](https://youtu.be/iyWFulQ7apg?t=2224) something therefore it didn't happen  
[0:37:06](https://youtu.be/iyWFulQ7apg?t=2226) this is called an argument from silence  
[0:37:07](https://youtu.be/iyWFulQ7apg?t=2227) fallacy  
[0:37:08](https://youtu.be/iyWFulQ7apg?t=2228) this is a fallacious reasoning just  
[0:37:10](https://youtu.be/iyWFulQ7apg?t=2230) because there's no evidence of something  
[0:37:12](https://youtu.be/iyWFulQ7apg?t=2232) or there is  
[0:37:12](https://youtu.be/iyWFulQ7apg?t=2232) currently no evidence of something it  
[0:37:14](https://youtu.be/iyWFulQ7apg?t=2234) doesn't mean that there  
[0:37:15](https://youtu.be/iyWFulQ7apg?t=2235) that thing didn't happen i'll give you a  
[0:37:17](https://youtu.be/iyWFulQ7apg?t=2237) great example of this like for example  
[0:37:20](https://youtu.be/iyWFulQ7apg?t=2240) from my gather from reading some of the  
[0:37:23](https://youtu.be/iyWFulQ7apg?t=2243) material on um  
[0:37:26](https://youtu.be/iyWFulQ7apg?t=2246) uh basically hebrew narratives and  
[0:37:29](https://youtu.be/iyWFulQ7apg?t=2249) especially like david  
[0:37:31](https://youtu.be/iyWFulQ7apg?t=2251) david alaihissalam that would um so  
[0:37:34](https://youtu.be/iyWFulQ7apg?t=2254) david if you look at for example some of  
[0:37:37](https://youtu.be/iyWFulQ7apg?t=2257) the  
[0:37:38](https://youtu.be/iyWFulQ7apg?t=2258) the academics i'm trying to remember  
[0:37:39](https://youtu.be/iyWFulQ7apg?t=2259) their name like israel finkelstein not  
[0:37:41](https://youtu.be/iyWFulQ7apg?t=2261) norman finkelstein there's a guy called  
[0:37:42](https://youtu.be/iyWFulQ7apg?t=2262) israel from finkelstein and others  
[0:37:44](https://youtu.be/iyWFulQ7apg?t=2264) who were pretty against like they had  
[0:37:48](https://youtu.be/iyWFulQ7apg?t=2268) they were against the idea that um david  
[0:37:50](https://youtu.be/iyWFulQ7apg?t=2270) could have actually existed as a prophet  
[0:37:52](https://youtu.be/iyWFulQ7apg?t=2272) et cetera  
[0:37:53](https://youtu.be/iyWFulQ7apg?t=2273) and a lot of them had bring their  
[0:37:55](https://youtu.be/iyWFulQ7apg?t=2275) writings that there's no  
[0:37:56](https://youtu.be/iyWFulQ7apg?t=2276) there's no evidence of david there's no  
[0:37:58](https://youtu.be/iyWFulQ7apg?t=2278) evidence of uh  
[0:37:59](https://youtu.be/iyWFulQ7apg?t=2279) and then there's something called a tell  
[0:38:02](https://youtu.be/iyWFulQ7apg?t=2282) that tells dan steeler  
[0:38:04](https://youtu.be/iyWFulQ7apg?t=2284) this stealer was basically like a rock  
[0:38:06](https://youtu.be/iyWFulQ7apg?t=2286) and on it had  
[0:38:07](https://youtu.be/iyWFulQ7apg?t=2287) you know the house of david so a lot of  
[0:38:10](https://youtu.be/iyWFulQ7apg?t=2290) people started changing their minds  
[0:38:12](https://youtu.be/iyWFulQ7apg?t=2292) on the existence of this thing called  
[0:38:13](https://youtu.be/iyWFulQ7apg?t=2293) the house of david because there was  
[0:38:15](https://youtu.be/iyWFulQ7apg?t=2295) extra biblical evidence  
[0:38:17](https://youtu.be/iyWFulQ7apg?t=2297) to promote this idea that there was this  
[0:38:20](https://youtu.be/iyWFulQ7apg?t=2300) you know tell dan steele and now  
[0:38:22](https://youtu.be/iyWFulQ7apg?t=2302) saying uh house of david and so on so  
[0:38:25](https://youtu.be/iyWFulQ7apg?t=2305) now there's extra biblical  
[0:38:26](https://youtu.be/iyWFulQ7apg?t=2306) now they have to reassess the  
[0:38:28](https://youtu.be/iyWFulQ7apg?t=2308) information and say  
[0:38:29](https://youtu.be/iyWFulQ7apg?t=2309) well maybe there was such a thing maybe  
[0:38:32](https://youtu.be/iyWFulQ7apg?t=2312) there was such a place  
[0:38:33](https://youtu.be/iyWFulQ7apg?t=2313) but maybe it's not as it's mentioned in  
[0:38:35](https://youtu.be/iyWFulQ7apg?t=2315) the bible they still have their  
[0:38:36](https://youtu.be/iyWFulQ7apg?t=2316) reservations but they've changed  
[0:38:37](https://youtu.be/iyWFulQ7apg?t=2317) it they've changed their stance yeah so  
[0:38:40](https://youtu.be/iyWFulQ7apg?t=2320) if if we're saying this discovery i  
[0:38:41](https://youtu.be/iyWFulQ7apg?t=2321) don't know when it was made by the way  
[0:38:42](https://youtu.be/iyWFulQ7apg?t=2322) maybe it was made 20 years ago but  
[0:38:44](https://youtu.be/iyWFulQ7apg?t=2324) see this discovery was made 20 years ago  
[0:38:46](https://youtu.be/iyWFulQ7apg?t=2326) if it wasn't made 30 years ago  
[0:38:48](https://youtu.be/iyWFulQ7apg?t=2328) um maybe 50 years ago people would be  
[0:38:50](https://youtu.be/iyWFulQ7apg?t=2330) saying there's no evidence yeah no  
[0:38:51](https://youtu.be/iyWFulQ7apg?t=2331) and if they were saying no there's no  
[0:38:52](https://youtu.be/iyWFulQ7apg?t=2332) evidence therefore there's no extra  
[0:38:54](https://youtu.be/iyWFulQ7apg?t=2334) biblical evidence of the existence of  
[0:38:55](https://youtu.be/iyWFulQ7apg?t=2335) david  
[0:38:56](https://youtu.be/iyWFulQ7apg?t=2336) yeah we would say that that would be an  
[0:38:58](https://youtu.be/iyWFulQ7apg?t=2338) argument from silence and the problem  
[0:38:59](https://youtu.be/iyWFulQ7apg?t=2339) with arguments from silence is that  
[0:39:01](https://youtu.be/iyWFulQ7apg?t=2341) all it takes is a decade or two for it  
[0:39:03](https://youtu.be/iyWFulQ7apg?t=2343) to be um  
[0:39:04](https://youtu.be/iyWFulQ7apg?t=2344) disproven and we know now especially  
[0:39:06](https://youtu.be/iyWFulQ7apg?t=2346) with the proliferation of like  
[0:39:08](https://youtu.be/iyWFulQ7apg?t=2348) archaeological  
[0:39:09](https://youtu.be/iyWFulQ7apg?t=2349) er evidences not everything has been dug  
[0:39:12](https://youtu.be/iyWFulQ7apg?t=2352) up not everything has been codified  
[0:39:14](https://youtu.be/iyWFulQ7apg?t=2354) number two is that we can't expect like  
[0:39:16](https://youtu.be/iyWFulQ7apg?t=2356) let's say for example this is  
[0:39:18](https://youtu.be/iyWFulQ7apg?t=2358) the whole uh splitting of the moon  
[0:39:20](https://youtu.be/iyWFulQ7apg?t=2360) phenomena  
[0:39:22](https://youtu.be/iyWFulQ7apg?t=2362) when did it happen let's say it happened  
[0:39:24](https://youtu.be/iyWFulQ7apg?t=2364) with the salam uh  
[0:39:25](https://youtu.be/iyWFulQ7apg?t=2365) in in a particular time let's say after  
[0:39:27](https://youtu.be/iyWFulQ7apg?t=2367) maghrib after  
[0:39:28](https://youtu.be/iyWFulQ7apg?t=2368) sunset time yeah first of all what was  
[0:39:30](https://youtu.be/iyWFulQ7apg?t=2370) the population of the earth at that time  
[0:39:32](https://youtu.be/iyWFulQ7apg?t=2372) i would probably estimate it i mean we  
[0:39:34](https://youtu.be/iyWFulQ7apg?t=2374) don't have any strong  
[0:39:35](https://youtu.be/iyWFulQ7apg?t=2375) figures on this there was no census that  
[0:39:37](https://youtu.be/iyWFulQ7apg?t=2377) was being done everywhere in the world  
[0:39:38](https://youtu.be/iyWFulQ7apg?t=2378) like we don't have any strong figures  
[0:39:40](https://youtu.be/iyWFulQ7apg?t=2380) but you can imagine seventh century  
[0:39:42](https://youtu.be/iyWFulQ7apg?t=2382) arabia because like only a hundred years  
[0:39:43](https://youtu.be/iyWFulQ7apg?t=2383) ago  
[0:39:44](https://youtu.be/iyWFulQ7apg?t=2384) the population of the world was one  
[0:39:45](https://youtu.be/iyWFulQ7apg?t=2385) billion yeah i mean it's gone up seven  
[0:39:48](https://youtu.be/iyWFulQ7apg?t=2388) fold in  
[0:39:49](https://youtu.be/iyWFulQ7apg?t=2389) 100 years yeah but there's also another  
[0:39:51](https://youtu.be/iyWFulQ7apg?t=2391) additional assumption here  
[0:39:53](https://youtu.be/iyWFulQ7apg?t=2393) and we can just undercut this argument  
[0:39:55](https://youtu.be/iyWFulQ7apg?t=2395) completely which is  
[0:39:57](https://youtu.be/iyWFulQ7apg?t=2397) this miracle is a miracle because we  
[0:39:59](https://youtu.be/iyWFulQ7apg?t=2399) believe the quran is a miracle and since  
[0:40:01](https://youtu.be/iyWFulQ7apg?t=2401) we can give evidence that the quran  
[0:40:03](https://youtu.be/iyWFulQ7apg?t=2403) is the word of allah that it doesn't  
[0:40:06](https://youtu.be/iyWFulQ7apg?t=2406) matter with anything else that it says  
[0:40:07](https://youtu.be/iyWFulQ7apg?t=2407) in the quran whether we have  
[0:40:09](https://youtu.be/iyWFulQ7apg?t=2409) whether someone thinks it meets up to a  
[0:40:11](https://youtu.be/iyWFulQ7apg?t=2411) certain criteria or it doesn't  
[0:40:13](https://youtu.be/iyWFulQ7apg?t=2413) secondly this whole idea of okay there  
[0:40:14](https://youtu.be/iyWFulQ7apg?t=2414) weren't people around  
[0:40:16](https://youtu.be/iyWFulQ7apg?t=2416) or we don't have evidence today who is  
[0:40:18](https://youtu.be/iyWFulQ7apg?t=2418) to say that that is  
[0:40:19](https://youtu.be/iyWFulQ7apg?t=2419) what allah intended this could be a  
[0:40:22](https://youtu.be/iyWFulQ7apg?t=2422) miracle as it's been explained by some  
[0:40:23](https://youtu.be/iyWFulQ7apg?t=2423) scholars that  
[0:40:24](https://youtu.be/iyWFulQ7apg?t=2424) it was just for the quraish because it  
[0:40:26](https://youtu.be/iyWFulQ7apg?t=2426) was for them  
[0:40:28](https://youtu.be/iyWFulQ7apg?t=2428) so you know it is it is inconceivable  
[0:40:31](https://youtu.be/iyWFulQ7apg?t=2431) for someone to use  
[0:40:33](https://youtu.be/iyWFulQ7apg?t=2433) an argument which is conditional which  
[0:40:35](https://youtu.be/iyWFulQ7apg?t=2435) is  
[0:40:36](https://youtu.be/iyWFulQ7apg?t=2436) which is in essence what they're saying  
[0:40:37](https://youtu.be/iyWFulQ7apg?t=2437) is it's not meeting my criteria my  
[0:40:40](https://youtu.be/iyWFulQ7apg?t=2440) criteria is there should be evidence  
[0:40:41](https://youtu.be/iyWFulQ7apg?t=2441) today  
[0:40:42](https://youtu.be/iyWFulQ7apg?t=2442) and there should be evidence of  
[0:40:43](https://youtu.be/iyWFulQ7apg?t=2443) independent people some people in china  
[0:40:45](https://youtu.be/iyWFulQ7apg?t=2445) who saw it  
[0:40:46](https://youtu.be/iyWFulQ7apg?t=2446) but that was never the intention there's  
[0:40:48](https://youtu.be/iyWFulQ7apg?t=2448) another thing as well right yeah so  
[0:40:50](https://youtu.be/iyWFulQ7apg?t=2450) if going back to the population numbers  
[0:40:52](https://youtu.be/iyWFulQ7apg?t=2452) if we're saying there's about 1 billion  
[0:40:53](https://youtu.be/iyWFulQ7apg?t=2453) people  
[0:40:54](https://youtu.be/iyWFulQ7apg?t=2454) 100 years ago yeah what was the  
[0:40:56](https://youtu.be/iyWFulQ7apg?t=2456) population figures for a thousand 400  
[0:40:57](https://youtu.be/iyWFulQ7apg?t=2457) years ago maybe 100 million yeah maybe  
[0:40:59](https://youtu.be/iyWFulQ7apg?t=2459) 50 million yeah  
[0:41:00](https://youtu.be/iyWFulQ7apg?t=2460) a low adam it could have been anywhere  
[0:41:02](https://youtu.be/iyWFulQ7apg?t=2462) from 50 million to 150 million yeah  
[0:41:04](https://youtu.be/iyWFulQ7apg?t=2464) these are just some of my like  
[0:41:05](https://youtu.be/iyWFulQ7apg?t=2465) estimates here in my mind now of those  
[0:41:07](https://youtu.be/iyWFulQ7apg?t=2467) individuals  
[0:41:09](https://youtu.be/iyWFulQ7apg?t=2469) how what was it in terms of night okay  
[0:41:11](https://youtu.be/iyWFulQ7apg?t=2471) so  
[0:41:12](https://youtu.be/iyWFulQ7apg?t=2472) okay that time can you wrap this up a  
[0:41:13](https://youtu.be/iyWFulQ7apg?t=2473) little bit because in terms of my time  
[0:41:15](https://youtu.be/iyWFulQ7apg?t=2475) how many  
[0:41:16](https://youtu.be/iyWFulQ7apg?t=2476) of those individuals it would have been  
[0:41:18](https://youtu.be/iyWFulQ7apg?t=2478) nightfall yeah then you're going to  
[0:41:19](https://youtu.be/iyWFulQ7apg?t=2479) eliminate  
[0:41:20](https://youtu.be/iyWFulQ7apg?t=2480) another and then how many are if they're  
[0:41:21](https://youtu.be/iyWFulQ7apg?t=2481) if it was night time how many of them  
[0:41:23](https://youtu.be/iyWFulQ7apg?t=2483) were awake  
[0:41:23](https://youtu.be/iyWFulQ7apg?t=2483) then you're going to eliminate this and  
[0:41:25](https://youtu.be/iyWFulQ7apg?t=2485) that now the point is if you don't  
[0:41:26](https://youtu.be/iyWFulQ7apg?t=2486) accept and how long did this last for i  
[0:41:28](https://youtu.be/iyWFulQ7apg?t=2488) mean this lasts for a second or two  
[0:41:30](https://youtu.be/iyWFulQ7apg?t=2490) yeah would that have been significant  
[0:41:31](https://youtu.be/iyWFulQ7apg?t=2491) enough for people to record it yeah if  
[0:41:33](https://youtu.be/iyWFulQ7apg?t=2493) something happened for one second  
[0:41:34](https://youtu.be/iyWFulQ7apg?t=2494) if i looked into the sky and saw  
[0:41:36](https://youtu.be/iyWFulQ7apg?t=2496) something yeah like would i record that  
[0:41:38](https://youtu.be/iyWFulQ7apg?t=2498) as an astronomer  
[0:41:40](https://youtu.be/iyWFulQ7apg?t=2500) yes i mean there's no surprise it's not  
[0:41:43](https://youtu.be/iyWFulQ7apg?t=2503) a great argument but the point i'm  
[0:41:44](https://youtu.be/iyWFulQ7apg?t=2504) making is this is that finally  
[0:41:46](https://youtu.be/iyWFulQ7apg?t=2506) we have assanit  
[0:41:50](https://youtu.be/iyWFulQ7apg?t=2510) when he when he pointed at the the  
[0:41:53](https://youtu.be/iyWFulQ7apg?t=2513) camera the moon  
[0:41:54](https://youtu.be/iyWFulQ7apg?t=2514) says um he said bear witness to this  
[0:41:57](https://youtu.be/iyWFulQ7apg?t=2517) belt listed this  
[0:41:58](https://youtu.be/iyWFulQ7apg?t=2518) and the people that saw it will witness  
[0:42:00](https://youtu.be/iyWFulQ7apg?t=2520) to it now here's my the final part of  
[0:42:02](https://youtu.be/iyWFulQ7apg?t=2522) this argument  
[0:42:03](https://youtu.be/iyWFulQ7apg?t=2523) to the people the quran says  
[0:42:09](https://youtu.be/iyWFulQ7apg?t=2529) that the the hour has come close and the  
[0:42:11](https://youtu.be/iyWFulQ7apg?t=2531) uh and the  
[0:42:12](https://youtu.be/iyWFulQ7apg?t=2532) and the moon has been split if  
[0:42:16](https://youtu.be/iyWFulQ7apg?t=2536) this was something which was foreign to  
[0:42:19](https://youtu.be/iyWFulQ7apg?t=2539) the majority of the target audience they  
[0:42:22](https://youtu.be/iyWFulQ7apg?t=2542) would have rejected that yeah  
[0:42:25](https://youtu.be/iyWFulQ7apg?t=2545) like for instance you know what the  
[0:42:26](https://youtu.be/iyWFulQ7apg?t=2546) quran says okay so let's  
[0:42:29](https://youtu.be/iyWFulQ7apg?t=2549) move on we do because there's loads of  
[0:42:31](https://youtu.be/iyWFulQ7apg?t=2551) people sorry hijab yeah

[0:42:34](https://youtu.be/iyWFulQ7apg?t=2554) that if it's something that's required  
[0:42:36](https://youtu.be/iyWFulQ7apg?t=2556) yep so earth uh could you ask a question  
[0:42:38](https://youtu.be/iyWFulQ7apg?t=2558) please yes yeah  
[0:42:39](https://youtu.be/iyWFulQ7apg?t=2559) yes welcome brother  
[0:42:43](https://youtu.be/iyWFulQ7apg?t=2563) i'm i'm the person that you're talking  
[0:42:46](https://youtu.be/iyWFulQ7apg?t=2566) you you've been answering me about the  
[0:42:49](https://youtu.be/iyWFulQ7apg?t=2569) flathead okay all right  
[0:42:53](https://youtu.be/iyWFulQ7apg?t=2573) i'm the same guy okay yeah uh  
[0:42:56](https://youtu.be/iyWFulQ7apg?t=2576) why that there's uh  
[0:42:59](https://youtu.be/iyWFulQ7apg?t=2579) many people like uh every christian or  
[0:43:03](https://youtu.be/iyWFulQ7apg?t=2583) muslims or any  
[0:43:04](https://youtu.be/iyWFulQ7apg?t=2584) any anybody they say that that  
[0:43:08](https://youtu.be/iyWFulQ7apg?t=2588) there's god they use cosmological  
[0:43:10](https://youtu.be/iyWFulQ7apg?t=2590) argument  
[0:43:11](https://youtu.be/iyWFulQ7apg?t=2591) then like the christian they're gonna  
[0:43:13](https://youtu.be/iyWFulQ7apg?t=2593) say that this is  
[0:43:15](https://youtu.be/iyWFulQ7apg?t=2595) jesus muslims they're gonna say this is  
[0:43:17](https://youtu.be/iyWFulQ7apg?t=2597) allah and  
[0:43:18](https://youtu.be/iyWFulQ7apg?t=2598) every everybody they will use  
[0:43:22](https://youtu.be/iyWFulQ7apg?t=2602) you know what i mean  
[0:43:25](https://youtu.be/iyWFulQ7apg?t=2605) yeah but the cosmological argument is  
[0:43:27](https://youtu.be/iyWFulQ7apg?t=2607) not making an argument for god man  
[0:43:31](https://youtu.be/iyWFulQ7apg?t=2611) and like uh like i would say  
[0:43:35](https://youtu.be/iyWFulQ7apg?t=2615) who create the universe they say we  
[0:43:37](https://youtu.be/iyWFulQ7apg?t=2617) don't know  
[0:43:38](https://youtu.be/iyWFulQ7apg?t=2618) if we say that from god um they say  
[0:43:41](https://youtu.be/iyWFulQ7apg?t=2621) like i'm i don't know i'm going to say  
[0:43:43](https://youtu.be/iyWFulQ7apg?t=2623) it's arabic  
[0:43:48](https://youtu.be/iyWFulQ7apg?t=2628) okay so what uh  
[0:43:51](https://youtu.be/iyWFulQ7apg?t=2631) what did they prove that the universe is  
[0:43:53](https://youtu.be/iyWFulQ7apg?t=2633) from allah  
[0:43:54](https://youtu.be/iyWFulQ7apg?t=2634) not just god from allah  
[0:43:58](https://youtu.be/iyWFulQ7apg?t=2638) well there's only so far logic can take  
[0:44:00](https://youtu.be/iyWFulQ7apg?t=2640) us  
[0:44:01](https://youtu.be/iyWFulQ7apg?t=2641) we can't in terms of the arguments that  
[0:44:03](https://youtu.be/iyWFulQ7apg?t=2643) we make  
[0:44:04](https://youtu.be/iyWFulQ7apg?t=2644) we don't make arguments for me not even  
[0:44:06](https://youtu.be/iyWFulQ7apg?t=2646) 99 but whatever it is attributes are in  
[0:44:08](https://youtu.be/iyWFulQ7apg?t=2648) the quran  
[0:44:09](https://youtu.be/iyWFulQ7apg?t=2649) that we don't say that the the  
[0:44:11](https://youtu.be/iyWFulQ7apg?t=2651) cosmological argument or the contingency  
[0:44:13](https://youtu.be/iyWFulQ7apg?t=2653) argument or the fine-tuning argument  
[0:44:14](https://youtu.be/iyWFulQ7apg?t=2654) yeah any of these arguments can give us  
[0:44:20](https://youtu.be/iyWFulQ7apg?t=2660) all of those things no we say that if  
[0:44:22](https://youtu.be/iyWFulQ7apg?t=2662) you argue well  
[0:44:24](https://youtu.be/iyWFulQ7apg?t=2664) and you argue properly we will be able  
[0:44:25](https://youtu.be/iyWFulQ7apg?t=2665) to establish that allah is pre-eternal  
[0:44:27](https://youtu.be/iyWFulQ7apg?t=2667) post-eternal he's one  
[0:44:28](https://youtu.be/iyWFulQ7apg?t=2668) he's powerful and he's knowledgeable and  
[0:44:31](https://youtu.be/iyWFulQ7apg?t=2671) everything depends upon him and he def  
[0:44:32](https://youtu.be/iyWFulQ7apg?t=2672) depends upon nothing which for us is a  
[0:44:34](https://youtu.be/iyWFulQ7apg?t=2674) base definition the samadhi of allah  
[0:44:36](https://youtu.be/iyWFulQ7apg?t=2676) subhanahu ta'ala  
[0:44:38](https://youtu.be/iyWFulQ7apg?t=2678) we can argue for those things that this  
[0:44:41](https://youtu.be/iyWFulQ7apg?t=2681) effect or the attributes that you would  
[0:44:43](https://youtu.be/iyWFulQ7apg?t=2683) be able to uh understand from  
[0:44:45](https://youtu.be/iyWFulQ7apg?t=2685) us we can get to that level yeah but the  
[0:44:47](https://youtu.be/iyWFulQ7apg?t=2687) level of all the  
[0:44:52](https://youtu.be/iyWFulQ7apg?t=2692) that requires someone to believe in the  
[0:44:54](https://youtu.be/iyWFulQ7apg?t=2694) quran and for that there requires to be  
[0:44:57](https://youtu.be/iyWFulQ7apg?t=2697) an argument from the quran the quran is  
[0:44:59](https://youtu.be/iyWFulQ7apg?t=2699) the word of allah for us to get all of  
[0:45:00](https://youtu.be/iyWFulQ7apg?t=2700) these other attributes of allah  
[0:45:02](https://youtu.be/iyWFulQ7apg?t=2702) absolutely  
[0:45:17](https://youtu.be/iyWFulQ7apg?t=2717) yeah my question was uh what are the  
[0:45:21](https://youtu.be/iyWFulQ7apg?t=2721) sort of general ideas of how  
[0:45:24](https://youtu.be/iyWFulQ7apg?t=2724) of the differences in the way that we  
[0:45:26](https://youtu.be/iyWFulQ7apg?t=2726) have to approach the  
[0:45:29](https://youtu.be/iyWFulQ7apg?t=2729) atheists and maybe even pagans of today  
[0:45:31](https://youtu.be/iyWFulQ7apg?t=2731) versus how the  
[0:45:33](https://youtu.be/iyWFulQ7apg?t=2733) prophet salarialism and the companions  
[0:45:35](https://youtu.be/iyWFulQ7apg?t=2735) had to approach  
[0:45:36](https://youtu.be/iyWFulQ7apg?t=2736) the pagans of their time and the  
[0:45:38](https://youtu.be/iyWFulQ7apg?t=2738) christians of their time  
[0:45:39](https://youtu.be/iyWFulQ7apg?t=2739) and how can we maybe utilize the tools  
[0:45:41](https://youtu.be/iyWFulQ7apg?t=2741) of the 21st century maybe you know  
[0:45:43](https://youtu.be/iyWFulQ7apg?t=2743) technology and these the study of  
[0:45:46](https://youtu.be/iyWFulQ7apg?t=2746) philosophy  
[0:45:47](https://youtu.be/iyWFulQ7apg?t=2747) and the studies that have emerged in  
[0:45:50](https://youtu.be/iyWFulQ7apg?t=2750) modern academia to  
[0:45:52](https://youtu.be/iyWFulQ7apg?t=2752) sort of spread islam in a way that's um  
[0:45:56](https://youtu.be/iyWFulQ7apg?t=2756) most suitable to the people of our time  
[0:45:58](https://youtu.be/iyWFulQ7apg?t=2758) the difference is that in that time  
[0:46:00](https://youtu.be/iyWFulQ7apg?t=2760) a lot of pagans like the quran says many  
[0:46:02](https://youtu.be/iyWFulQ7apg?t=2762) times  
[0:46:05](https://youtu.be/iyWFulQ7apg?t=2765) if you ask them who created the heavens  
[0:46:07](https://youtu.be/iyWFulQ7apg?t=2767) and the earth they would say allah even  
[0:46:08](https://youtu.be/iyWFulQ7apg?t=2768) the pagans would say that  
[0:46:10](https://youtu.be/iyWFulQ7apg?t=2770) now if you ask some of the atheists  
[0:46:12](https://youtu.be/iyWFulQ7apg?t=2772) they'll say i don't know or they would  
[0:46:14](https://youtu.be/iyWFulQ7apg?t=2774) say  
[0:46:15](https://youtu.be/iyWFulQ7apg?t=2775) it's not they wouldn't say allah so we  
[0:46:17](https://youtu.be/iyWFulQ7apg?t=2777) have to start with rubobia  
[0:46:19](https://youtu.be/iyWFulQ7apg?t=2779) before they don't really have to start  
[0:46:20](https://youtu.be/iyWFulQ7apg?t=2780) with in that sense although  
[0:46:22](https://youtu.be/iyWFulQ7apg?t=2782) they have to start with uluhiya but you  
[0:46:25](https://youtu.be/iyWFulQ7apg?t=2785) know we have to start with  
[0:46:27](https://youtu.be/iyWFulQ7apg?t=2787) you so and that's in a way that what  
[0:46:29](https://youtu.be/iyWFulQ7apg?t=2789) abraham ibrahim did  
[0:46:31](https://youtu.be/iyWFulQ7apg?t=2791) uh when he was talking about you know  
[0:46:35](https://youtu.be/iyWFulQ7apg?t=2795) this is  
[0:46:35](https://youtu.be/iyWFulQ7apg?t=2795) my lord this is my lord and he did  
[0:46:37](https://youtu.be/iyWFulQ7apg?t=2797) something called argumentum and absurdum  
[0:46:39](https://youtu.be/iyWFulQ7apg?t=2799) so i showed that all these things can't  
[0:46:40](https://youtu.be/iyWFulQ7apg?t=2800) be  
[0:46:41](https://youtu.be/iyWFulQ7apg?t=2801) lord therefore you know something which  
[0:46:43](https://youtu.be/iyWFulQ7apg?t=2803) doesn't have  
[0:46:44](https://youtu.be/iyWFulQ7apg?t=2804) these uh contingent qualities must be  
[0:46:47](https://youtu.be/iyWFulQ7apg?t=2807) something which is necessary and  
[0:46:49](https://youtu.be/iyWFulQ7apg?t=2809) powerful and  
[0:46:50](https://youtu.be/iyWFulQ7apg?t=2810) is it doesn't uh set in the case of the  
[0:46:53](https://youtu.be/iyWFulQ7apg?t=2813) sun and the moon and so on  
[0:46:55](https://youtu.be/iyWFulQ7apg?t=2815) yeah yeah i mean overall i would i would  
[0:46:57](https://youtu.be/iyWFulQ7apg?t=2817) add look  
[0:46:58](https://youtu.be/iyWFulQ7apg?t=2818) um when it comes to prophet sallam he  
[0:47:00](https://youtu.be/iyWFulQ7apg?t=2820) was smashing idols he was smashing the  
[0:47:02](https://youtu.be/iyWFulQ7apg?t=2822) la  
[0:47:03](https://youtu.be/iyWFulQ7apg?t=2823) the idols of lot zamanath and what were  
[0:47:05](https://youtu.be/iyWFulQ7apg?t=2825) they they were basically  
[0:47:07](https://youtu.be/iyWFulQ7apg?t=2827) where the creation of allah gave the  
[0:47:09](https://youtu.be/iyWFulQ7apg?t=2829) creation of allah  
[0:47:11](https://youtu.be/iyWFulQ7apg?t=2831) some attributes of allah and and and  
[0:47:13](https://youtu.be/iyWFulQ7apg?t=2833) said okay  
[0:47:15](https://youtu.be/iyWFulQ7apg?t=2835) these things they they suffice us they  
[0:47:17](https://youtu.be/iyWFulQ7apg?t=2837) take care of us  
[0:47:18](https://youtu.be/iyWFulQ7apg?t=2838) well there's no difference between the  
[0:47:20](https://youtu.be/iyWFulQ7apg?t=2840) atheists today in the quraish  
[0:47:22](https://youtu.be/iyWFulQ7apg?t=2842) then because the for the atheists the  
[0:47:24](https://youtu.be/iyWFulQ7apg?t=2844) universe  
[0:47:26](https://youtu.be/iyWFulQ7apg?t=2846) or natural selection or mother nature  
[0:47:29](https://youtu.be/iyWFulQ7apg?t=2849) this is the new lot  
[0:47:30](https://youtu.be/iyWFulQ7apg?t=2850) this is the new uzza it's the same thing  
[0:47:33](https://youtu.be/iyWFulQ7apg?t=2853) they've given  
[0:47:34](https://youtu.be/iyWFulQ7apg?t=2854) nature that placeholder label rather  
[0:47:36](https://youtu.be/iyWFulQ7apg?t=2856) than  
[0:47:37](https://youtu.be/iyWFulQ7apg?t=2857) sticks and stones but in essence it's  
[0:47:39](https://youtu.be/iyWFulQ7apg?t=2859) the same argument  
[0:47:41](https://youtu.be/iyWFulQ7apg?t=2861) um and you find this that you know the  
[0:47:43](https://youtu.be/iyWFulQ7apg?t=2863) universe has a plan for you you know  
[0:47:45](https://youtu.be/iyWFulQ7apg?t=2865) it's the same thing it's the exact same  
[0:47:47](https://youtu.be/iyWFulQ7apg?t=2867) thing  
[0:47:47](https://youtu.be/iyWFulQ7apg?t=2867) so um you know there is there isn't much  
[0:47:50](https://youtu.be/iyWFulQ7apg?t=2870) of a difference here  
[0:47:51](https://youtu.be/iyWFulQ7apg?t=2871) okay let's move on to brother redder  
[0:47:59](https://youtu.be/iyWFulQ7apg?t=2879) salam brother hi uh  
[0:48:03](https://youtu.be/iyWFulQ7apg?t=2883) uh okay so i have two questions can i  
[0:48:05](https://youtu.be/iyWFulQ7apg?t=2885) ask both or can i only ask one of the  
[0:48:07](https://youtu.be/iyWFulQ7apg?t=2887) two  
[0:48:08](https://youtu.be/iyWFulQ7apg?t=2888) one please my brother just we have very  
[0:48:11](https://youtu.be/iyWFulQ7apg?t=2891) a lot of people yeah um no issues no  
[0:48:14](https://youtu.be/iyWFulQ7apg?t=2894) issues so basically  
[0:48:15](https://youtu.be/iyWFulQ7apg?t=2895) um i had a interesting discussion with  
[0:48:17](https://youtu.be/iyWFulQ7apg?t=2897) an atheist the other day  
[0:48:20](https://youtu.be/iyWFulQ7apg?t=2900) and the discussion was regarding quantum  
[0:48:23](https://youtu.be/iyWFulQ7apg?t=2903) mechanics  
[0:48:24](https://youtu.be/iyWFulQ7apg?t=2904) and in relation to the first premise of  
[0:48:26](https://youtu.be/iyWFulQ7apg?t=2906) the kalam cosmological argument  
[0:48:28](https://youtu.be/iyWFulQ7apg?t=2908) this individual's argument basically  
[0:48:30](https://youtu.be/iyWFulQ7apg?t=2910) he's saying  
[0:48:32](https://youtu.be/iyWFulQ7apg?t=2912) sorry  
[0:48:33](https://youtu.be/iyWFulQ7apg?t=2913) [Music]  
[0:48:35](https://youtu.be/iyWFulQ7apg?t=2915) okay basically what this person is  
[0:48:36](https://youtu.be/iyWFulQ7apg?t=2916) saying is um  
[0:48:38](https://youtu.be/iyWFulQ7apg?t=2918) [Music]  
[0:48:40](https://youtu.be/iyWFulQ7apg?t=2920) something can come from nothing because  
[0:48:42](https://youtu.be/iyWFulQ7apg?t=2922) a  
[0:48:43](https://youtu.be/iyWFulQ7apg?t=2923) vacuum sorry basically saying something  
[0:48:45](https://youtu.be/iyWFulQ7apg?t=2925) can come from nothing because quantum  
[0:48:47](https://youtu.be/iyWFulQ7apg?t=2927) mechanics is indeterministic  
[0:48:50](https://youtu.be/iyWFulQ7apg?t=2930) meaning that it manipulates space-time  
[0:48:52](https://youtu.be/iyWFulQ7apg?t=2932) which is what this is what he said and  
[0:48:54](https://youtu.be/iyWFulQ7apg?t=2934) then he said  
[0:48:55](https://youtu.be/iyWFulQ7apg?t=2935) according to heisenberg's uncertainty  
[0:48:57](https://youtu.be/iyWFulQ7apg?t=2937) principle  
[0:48:58](https://youtu.be/iyWFulQ7apg?t=2938) in a vacuum um particles are both in and  
[0:49:02](https://youtu.be/iyWFulQ7apg?t=2942) out of existence  
[0:49:03](https://youtu.be/iyWFulQ7apg?t=2943) something along those lines what i'm  
[0:49:04](https://youtu.be/iyWFulQ7apg?t=2944) wondering is can you maybe give me some  
[0:49:07](https://youtu.be/iyWFulQ7apg?t=2947) more insight into  
[0:49:09](https://youtu.be/iyWFulQ7apg?t=2949) what that's just let me see yeah sorry  
[0:49:11](https://youtu.be/iyWFulQ7apg?t=2951) to cut you that's a very very simple  
[0:49:14](https://youtu.be/iyWFulQ7apg?t=2954) old contention um anything within the  
[0:49:17](https://youtu.be/iyWFulQ7apg?t=2957) universe  
[0:49:18](https://youtu.be/iyWFulQ7apg?t=2958) that is taking place is obviously taking  
[0:49:20](https://youtu.be/iyWFulQ7apg?t=2960) place within a  
[0:49:21](https://youtu.be/iyWFulQ7apg?t=2961) rich sea of particles so it's not from  
[0:49:24](https://youtu.be/iyWFulQ7apg?t=2964) nothing  
[0:49:25](https://youtu.be/iyWFulQ7apg?t=2965) and just because we don't know the cause  
[0:49:27](https://youtu.be/iyWFulQ7apg?t=2967) doesn't mean that  
[0:49:28](https://youtu.be/iyWFulQ7apg?t=2968) something can pop into existence from  
[0:49:30](https://youtu.be/iyWFulQ7apg?t=2970) nothing and if something does  
[0:49:32](https://youtu.be/iyWFulQ7apg?t=2972) come within this universe um then it's  
[0:49:34](https://youtu.be/iyWFulQ7apg?t=2974) within the universe right so that there  
[0:49:36](https://youtu.be/iyWFulQ7apg?t=2976) is obviously some causation there  
[0:49:38](https://youtu.be/iyWFulQ7apg?t=2978) so this is an argument which has been  
[0:49:39](https://youtu.be/iyWFulQ7apg?t=2979) dealt with in the past uh it's basically  
[0:49:43](https://youtu.be/iyWFulQ7apg?t=2983) could you could you could classify as  
[0:49:44](https://youtu.be/iyWFulQ7apg?t=2984) another fallacy of equivocation because  
[0:49:46](https://youtu.be/iyWFulQ7apg?t=2986) what they mean by nothing is not what we  
[0:49:48](https://youtu.be/iyWFulQ7apg?t=2988) mean by nothing which is an absence of  
[0:49:50](https://youtu.be/iyWFulQ7apg?t=2990) anything right but if something's  
[0:49:52](https://youtu.be/iyWFulQ7apg?t=2992) happening within the universe then  
[0:49:54](https://youtu.be/iyWFulQ7apg?t=2994) obviously  
[0:49:54](https://youtu.be/iyWFulQ7apg?t=2994) it cannot be nothing so uh  
[0:49:58](https://youtu.be/iyWFulQ7apg?t=2998) hamza's book has this contention in a  
[0:50:00](https://youtu.be/iyWFulQ7apg?t=3000) lot more detail  
[0:50:02](https://youtu.be/iyWFulQ7apg?t=3002) um but yeah that that's a very critical  
[0:50:04](https://youtu.be/iyWFulQ7apg?t=3004) also russian russian's book has  
[0:50:06](https://youtu.be/iyWFulQ7apg?t=3006) uh the necessary existence no he's he  
[0:50:09](https://youtu.be/iyWFulQ7apg?t=3009) he's got something  
[0:50:10](https://youtu.be/iyWFulQ7apg?t=3010) called one of the objections from  
[0:50:12](https://youtu.be/iyWFulQ7apg?t=3012) quantum character if you want further  
[0:50:13](https://youtu.be/iyWFulQ7apg?t=3013) reading go to that book  
[0:50:14](https://youtu.be/iyWFulQ7apg?t=3014) brilliant okay let's go to brother  
[0:50:16](https://youtu.be/iyWFulQ7apg?t=3016) faisal  
[0:50:21](https://youtu.be/iyWFulQ7apg?t=3021) faisal are you there didn't we just  
[0:50:24](https://youtu.be/iyWFulQ7apg?t=3024) speak to facebook  
[0:50:26](https://youtu.be/iyWFulQ7apg?t=3026) did we speak to facebook okay  
[0:50:30](https://youtu.be/iyWFulQ7apg?t=3030) um remove okay um  
[0:50:33](https://youtu.be/iyWFulQ7apg?t=3033) [Music]  
[0:50:35](https://youtu.be/iyWFulQ7apg?t=3035) so by the way if we answer your  
[0:50:36](https://youtu.be/iyWFulQ7apg?t=3036) questions please could you leave the  
[0:50:38](https://youtu.be/iyWFulQ7apg?t=3038) studio because other people are trying  
[0:50:39](https://youtu.be/iyWFulQ7apg?t=3039) to join  
[0:50:40](https://youtu.be/iyWFulQ7apg?t=3040) so uh the next one is to khan  
[0:50:44](https://youtu.be/iyWFulQ7apg?t=3044) brothers how are you  
[0:50:49](https://youtu.be/iyWFulQ7apg?t=3049) [Music]  
[0:50:50](https://youtu.be/iyWFulQ7apg?t=3050) i'm very happy to talk with you i have a  
[0:50:52](https://youtu.be/iyWFulQ7apg?t=3052) question  
[0:50:54](https://youtu.be/iyWFulQ7apg?t=3054) according to the philosophy of  
[0:50:56](https://youtu.be/iyWFulQ7apg?t=3056) materialism  
[0:50:57](https://youtu.be/iyWFulQ7apg?t=3057) everything is purposeless and  
[0:50:59](https://youtu.be/iyWFulQ7apg?t=3059) meaningless then we  
[0:51:01](https://youtu.be/iyWFulQ7apg?t=3061) ask a question why do we feel a sense of  
[0:51:03](https://youtu.be/iyWFulQ7apg?t=3063) meaning  
[0:51:04](https://youtu.be/iyWFulQ7apg?t=3064) they asked a day after that richard  
[0:51:07](https://youtu.be/iyWFulQ7apg?t=3067) tonkin  
[0:51:08](https://youtu.be/iyWFulQ7apg?t=3068) explained it in the selfish gene that  
[0:51:11](https://youtu.be/iyWFulQ7apg?t=3071) meaning is something that environment  
[0:51:13](https://youtu.be/iyWFulQ7apg?t=3073) give us and  
[0:51:14](https://youtu.be/iyWFulQ7apg?t=3074) we think that this is a meaning and  
[0:51:19](https://youtu.be/iyWFulQ7apg?t=3079) that mutation in genes cause us to think  
[0:51:22](https://youtu.be/iyWFulQ7apg?t=3082) that there is many  
[0:51:23](https://youtu.be/iyWFulQ7apg?t=3083) obviously there is no meaning so natural  
[0:51:26](https://youtu.be/iyWFulQ7apg?t=3086) selection is something that  
[0:51:27](https://youtu.be/iyWFulQ7apg?t=3087) uh create a illusion of me  
[0:51:31](https://youtu.be/iyWFulQ7apg?t=3091) yep and this is a  
[0:51:34](https://youtu.be/iyWFulQ7apg?t=3094) a standard sort of question which is  
[0:51:36](https://youtu.be/iyWFulQ7apg?t=3096) asked  
[0:51:37](https://youtu.be/iyWFulQ7apg?t=3097) um and many of these sort of uh things  
[0:51:40](https://youtu.be/iyWFulQ7apg?t=3100) are put forward and the problem here  
[0:51:42](https://youtu.be/iyWFulQ7apg?t=3102) is it's an assertion it's not an  
[0:51:45](https://youtu.be/iyWFulQ7apg?t=3105) argument  
[0:51:46](https://youtu.be/iyWFulQ7apg?t=3106) so you know natural selection has  
[0:51:48](https://youtu.be/iyWFulQ7apg?t=3108) designed us in a way that  
[0:51:50](https://youtu.be/iyWFulQ7apg?t=3110) is making us more likely to be  
[0:51:51](https://youtu.be/iyWFulQ7apg?t=3111) creationists that's another thing that  
[0:51:53](https://youtu.be/iyWFulQ7apg?t=3113) they say  
[0:51:54](https://youtu.be/iyWFulQ7apg?t=3114) in addition to is is created this um  
[0:51:58](https://youtu.be/iyWFulQ7apg?t=3118) this illusion within us that there  
[0:51:59](https://youtu.be/iyWFulQ7apg?t=3119) should be meaning in the universe or  
[0:52:01](https://youtu.be/iyWFulQ7apg?t=3121) this illusion  
[0:52:02](https://youtu.be/iyWFulQ7apg?t=3122) uh within us to believe in god because  
[0:52:04](https://youtu.be/iyWFulQ7apg?t=3124) we have a a design detection  
[0:52:06](https://youtu.be/iyWFulQ7apg?t=3126) module which we developed in our  
[0:52:08](https://youtu.be/iyWFulQ7apg?t=3128) evolutionary history  
[0:52:09](https://youtu.be/iyWFulQ7apg?t=3129) all of these are assertions now in order  
[0:52:12](https://youtu.be/iyWFulQ7apg?t=3132) for you to challenge  
[0:52:13](https://youtu.be/iyWFulQ7apg?t=3133) an assertion you first need them to give  
[0:52:16](https://youtu.be/iyWFulQ7apg?t=3136) you an argument  
[0:52:17](https://youtu.be/iyWFulQ7apg?t=3137) when they give you an argument then you  
[0:52:18](https://youtu.be/iyWFulQ7apg?t=3138) can challenge the premises and then you  
[0:52:20](https://youtu.be/iyWFulQ7apg?t=3140) can actually refute it  
[0:52:21](https://youtu.be/iyWFulQ7apg?t=3141) but at this moment all they've said is  
[0:52:24](https://youtu.be/iyWFulQ7apg?t=3144) here is an assertion what can be a third  
[0:52:27](https://youtu.be/iyWFulQ7apg?t=3147) pin without evidence can be dismissed  
[0:52:29](https://youtu.be/iyWFulQ7apg?t=3149) with our evidence  
[0:52:30](https://youtu.be/iyWFulQ7apg?t=3150) so that's the way you deal with it we  
[0:52:32](https://youtu.be/iyWFulQ7apg?t=3152) say but what's that  
[0:52:34](https://youtu.be/iyWFulQ7apg?t=3154) they say that it is an environment it is  
[0:52:37](https://youtu.be/iyWFulQ7apg?t=3157) your environment which gives you  
[0:52:38](https://youtu.be/iyWFulQ7apg?t=3158) some meanings so due to the mutation in  
[0:52:41](https://youtu.be/iyWFulQ7apg?t=3161) dna or genes  
[0:52:42](https://youtu.be/iyWFulQ7apg?t=3162) you think that there is a meaning yep  
[0:52:44](https://youtu.be/iyWFulQ7apg?t=3164) that's an assertion  
[0:52:46](https://youtu.be/iyWFulQ7apg?t=3166) what's the evidence for that  
[0:52:49](https://youtu.be/iyWFulQ7apg?t=3169) like today we are doing the same thing  
[0:52:52](https://youtu.be/iyWFulQ7apg?t=3172) um  
[0:52:53](https://youtu.be/iyWFulQ7apg?t=3173) when our environment give us a meaning  
[0:52:55](https://youtu.be/iyWFulQ7apg?t=3175) uh we when we born we don't think that  
[0:52:57](https://youtu.be/iyWFulQ7apg?t=3177) we have a meaning  
[0:52:59](https://youtu.be/iyWFulQ7apg?t=3179) when our environment tells us you have a  
[0:53:01](https://youtu.be/iyWFulQ7apg?t=3181) meaning what parents tell us that  
[0:53:03](https://youtu.be/iyWFulQ7apg?t=3183) they give a response but how does that  
[0:53:06](https://youtu.be/iyWFulQ7apg?t=3186) show that natural selection selected  
[0:53:08](https://youtu.be/iyWFulQ7apg?t=3188) that  
[0:53:09](https://youtu.be/iyWFulQ7apg?t=3189) what's the evidence for that i don't  
[0:53:12](https://youtu.be/iyWFulQ7apg?t=3192) think  
[0:53:12](https://youtu.be/iyWFulQ7apg?t=3192) there  
[0:53:16](https://youtu.be/iyWFulQ7apg?t=3196) you have to remember the way evolution  
[0:53:20](https://youtu.be/iyWFulQ7apg?t=3200) works and this is extremely important  
[0:53:21](https://youtu.be/iyWFulQ7apg?t=3201) for everyone to understand  
[0:53:23](https://youtu.be/iyWFulQ7apg?t=3203) even darwinis get this wrong sometimes  
[0:53:26](https://youtu.be/iyWFulQ7apg?t=3206) it's not the case that our  
[0:53:28](https://youtu.be/iyWFulQ7apg?t=3208) mind develops because of the environment  
[0:53:31](https://youtu.be/iyWFulQ7apg?t=3211) now  
[0:53:32](https://youtu.be/iyWFulQ7apg?t=3212) it doesn't our mind developed  
[0:53:35](https://youtu.be/iyWFulQ7apg?t=3215) in a period of time when we were hunter  
[0:53:38](https://youtu.be/iyWFulQ7apg?t=3218) gatherers in which we had a stable  
[0:53:40](https://youtu.be/iyWFulQ7apg?t=3220) environment for hundreds of thousands of  
[0:53:42](https://youtu.be/iyWFulQ7apg?t=3222) years  
[0:53:43](https://youtu.be/iyWFulQ7apg?t=3223) in this environment in which every  
[0:53:45](https://youtu.be/iyWFulQ7apg?t=3225) decade is complete change  
[0:53:47](https://youtu.be/iyWFulQ7apg?t=3227) there's not enough time for natural  
[0:53:48](https://youtu.be/iyWFulQ7apg?t=3228) selection to  
[0:53:51](https://youtu.be/iyWFulQ7apg?t=3231) shape your cognitive mechanisms  
[0:53:54](https://youtu.be/iyWFulQ7apg?t=3234) therefore  
[0:53:55](https://youtu.be/iyWFulQ7apg?t=3235) the way darwin is see is we're  
[0:53:56](https://youtu.be/iyWFulQ7apg?t=3236) mismatched for the modern world  
[0:53:58](https://youtu.be/iyWFulQ7apg?t=3238) so even when they start saying well  
[0:54:00](https://youtu.be/iyWFulQ7apg?t=3240) we're acting like this because of the  
[0:54:02](https://youtu.be/iyWFulQ7apg?t=3242) internet and the internet has affected  
[0:54:04](https://youtu.be/iyWFulQ7apg?t=3244) us and we evolved  
[0:54:05](https://youtu.be/iyWFulQ7apg?t=3245) all of that is nonsense because our  
[0:54:06](https://youtu.be/iyWFulQ7apg?t=3246) evolutionary history  
[0:54:08](https://youtu.be/iyWFulQ7apg?t=3248) even according to them happened in the  
[0:54:10](https://youtu.be/iyWFulQ7apg?t=3250) hunter gatherer  
[0:54:11](https://youtu.be/iyWFulQ7apg?t=3251) era and uh you know they saw this  
[0:54:13](https://youtu.be/iyWFulQ7apg?t=3253) whenever they say things like  
[0:54:15](https://youtu.be/iyWFulQ7apg?t=3255) well in uh meaning is not intrinsic uh  
[0:54:18](https://youtu.be/iyWFulQ7apg?t=3258) meaning uh doesn't exist it's purely  
[0:54:21](https://youtu.be/iyWFulQ7apg?t=3261) environmentally induced  
[0:54:22](https://youtu.be/iyWFulQ7apg?t=3262) we can simply say well there's no  
[0:54:24](https://youtu.be/iyWFulQ7apg?t=3264) evidence for that and secondly  
[0:54:26](https://youtu.be/iyWFulQ7apg?t=3266) if you are going to say that it's  
[0:54:28](https://youtu.be/iyWFulQ7apg?t=3268) environmentally induced and it's  
[0:54:30](https://youtu.be/iyWFulQ7apg?t=3270) something which natural selection  
[0:54:32](https://youtu.be/iyWFulQ7apg?t=3272) came up with then you have to give us a  
[0:54:35](https://youtu.be/iyWFulQ7apg?t=3275) little bit of evidence for that for us  
[0:54:37](https://youtu.be/iyWFulQ7apg?t=3277) to even to begin to have the  
[0:54:38](https://youtu.be/iyWFulQ7apg?t=3278) conversation  
[0:54:39](https://youtu.be/iyWFulQ7apg?t=3279) but again they need to give a  
[0:54:42](https://youtu.be/iyWFulQ7apg?t=3282) argument they're just giving an  
[0:54:43](https://youtu.be/iyWFulQ7apg?t=3283) assertion and you have to be able to as  
[0:54:46](https://youtu.be/iyWFulQ7apg?t=3286) adaya  
[0:54:47](https://youtu.be/iyWFulQ7apg?t=3287) you have to be able to simply not only  
[0:54:49](https://youtu.be/iyWFulQ7apg?t=3289) in this case but in every case that this  
[0:54:51](https://youtu.be/iyWFulQ7apg?t=3291) comes up simply dismiss it  
[0:54:53](https://youtu.be/iyWFulQ7apg?t=3293) because thank you so much thank you so  
[0:54:55](https://youtu.be/iyWFulQ7apg?t=3295) much yeah  
[0:54:56](https://youtu.be/iyWFulQ7apg?t=3296) it's like this i i sometimes get muslim  
[0:54:58](https://youtu.be/iyWFulQ7apg?t=3298) saying my atheist friend said  
[0:55:01](https://youtu.be/iyWFulQ7apg?t=3301) design is an illusion i don't answer the  
[0:55:04](https://youtu.be/iyWFulQ7apg?t=3304) question i say well first  
[0:55:05](https://youtu.be/iyWFulQ7apg?t=3305) they need to give argument for that  
[0:55:07](https://youtu.be/iyWFulQ7apg?t=3307) assertion then we can deal with it so  
[0:55:09](https://youtu.be/iyWFulQ7apg?t=3309) it's the same thing inshallah  
[0:55:11](https://youtu.be/iyWFulQ7apg?t=3311) would you like a locate with it does not  
[0:55:15](https://youtu.be/iyWFulQ7apg?t=3315) okay next is i'm going to give this to  
[0:55:17](https://youtu.be/iyWFulQ7apg?t=3317) you hijab the guy with the thumbs up  
[0:55:18](https://youtu.be/iyWFulQ7apg?t=3318) let's see what  
[0:55:25](https://youtu.be/iyWFulQ7apg?t=3325) i wanted to ask a question about  
[0:55:26](https://youtu.be/iyWFulQ7apg?t=3326) equality uh generally in the middle east  
[0:55:29](https://youtu.be/iyWFulQ7apg?t=3329) um if islam came to  
[0:55:32](https://youtu.be/iyWFulQ7apg?t=3332) kind to uh establish equality  
[0:55:36](https://youtu.be/iyWFulQ7apg?t=3336) obviously back then people were  
[0:55:37](https://youtu.be/iyWFulQ7apg?t=3337) mistreated and  
[0:55:39](https://youtu.be/iyWFulQ7apg?t=3339) and all of that today we see large  
[0:55:42](https://youtu.be/iyWFulQ7apg?t=3342) amounts of inequality especially  
[0:55:44](https://youtu.be/iyWFulQ7apg?t=3344) uh when it comes to the female side of  
[0:55:46](https://youtu.be/iyWFulQ7apg?t=3346) things um  
[0:55:47](https://youtu.be/iyWFulQ7apg?t=3347) so that so to me there's a disconnect  
[0:55:50](https://youtu.be/iyWFulQ7apg?t=3350) and obviously i could be wrong but where  
[0:55:53](https://youtu.be/iyWFulQ7apg?t=3353) did that  
[0:55:54](https://youtu.be/iyWFulQ7apg?t=3354) kind of disconnect happen and where did  
[0:55:57](https://youtu.be/iyWFulQ7apg?t=3357) i go off the rails if that makes sense i  
[0:55:59](https://youtu.be/iyWFulQ7apg?t=3359) think about racial agenda sorry  
[0:56:01](https://youtu.be/iyWFulQ7apg?t=3361) just gender i mean gender by itself  
[0:56:04](https://youtu.be/iyWFulQ7apg?t=3364) at the moment but yeah yeah it's gender  
[0:56:06](https://youtu.be/iyWFulQ7apg?t=3366) yeah so for sure  
[0:56:07](https://youtu.be/iyWFulQ7apg?t=3367) islam is not trying to do what feminism  
[0:56:09](https://youtu.be/iyWFulQ7apg?t=3369) is trying to do you know  
[0:56:11](https://youtu.be/iyWFulQ7apg?t=3371) second wave feminism is saying that  
[0:56:15](https://youtu.be/iyWFulQ7apg?t=3375) despite all of the differences that we  
[0:56:17](https://youtu.be/iyWFulQ7apg?t=3377) have anatomical and so on  
[0:56:19](https://youtu.be/iyWFulQ7apg?t=3379) that we should have equality between men  
[0:56:21](https://youtu.be/iyWFulQ7apg?t=3381) and women and  
[0:56:22](https://youtu.be/iyWFulQ7apg?t=3382) and islam says that generally there's  
[0:56:24](https://youtu.be/iyWFulQ7apg?t=3384) equality between the lord should be at  
[0:56:25](https://youtu.be/iyWFulQ7apg?t=3385) least  
[0:56:26](https://youtu.be/iyWFulQ7apg?t=3386) equality in front of the law because the  
[0:56:28](https://youtu.be/iyWFulQ7apg?t=3388) prophet said in them  
[0:56:30](https://youtu.be/iyWFulQ7apg?t=3390) that certainly men are equal to women  
[0:56:33](https://youtu.be/iyWFulQ7apg?t=3393) but there are  
[0:56:34](https://youtu.be/iyWFulQ7apg?t=3394) very clear exceptions to that so we  
[0:56:36](https://youtu.be/iyWFulQ7apg?t=3396) don't believe in an absolute equality  
[0:56:38](https://youtu.be/iyWFulQ7apg?t=3398) like  
[0:56:39](https://youtu.be/iyWFulQ7apg?t=3399) the way in which someone like negozi the  
[0:56:41](https://youtu.be/iyWFulQ7apg?t=3401) one who wrote the feminist manifesto  
[0:56:43](https://youtu.be/iyWFulQ7apg?t=3403) recently she was saying that he believe  
[0:56:45](https://youtu.be/iyWFulQ7apg?t=3405) i was reading a book a very small  
[0:56:47](https://youtu.be/iyWFulQ7apg?t=3407) book and she was saying we live in  
[0:56:48](https://youtu.be/iyWFulQ7apg?t=3408) absolute equality for this for the  
[0:56:50](https://youtu.be/iyWFulQ7apg?t=3410) genders  
[0:56:51](https://youtu.be/iyWFulQ7apg?t=3411) except for breastfeeding i think that  
[0:56:52](https://youtu.be/iyWFulQ7apg?t=3412) was the one thing that she  
[0:56:54](https://youtu.be/iyWFulQ7apg?t=3414) made as an exception you say that  
[0:56:55](https://youtu.be/iyWFulQ7apg?t=3415) there's some real anatomical and  
[0:56:57](https://youtu.be/iyWFulQ7apg?t=3417) physiological and psychological and  
[0:56:59](https://youtu.be/iyWFulQ7apg?t=3419) emotional  
[0:56:59](https://youtu.be/iyWFulQ7apg?t=3419) and um psychological differences between  
[0:57:02](https://youtu.be/iyWFulQ7apg?t=3422) men and women  
[0:57:03](https://youtu.be/iyWFulQ7apg?t=3423) and those all need to be taken to  
[0:57:05](https://youtu.be/iyWFulQ7apg?t=3425) consideration when  
[0:57:07](https://youtu.be/iyWFulQ7apg?t=3427) in prescription and so um we don't we  
[0:57:10](https://youtu.be/iyWFulQ7apg?t=3430) don't share the same beliefs as  
[0:57:12](https://youtu.be/iyWFulQ7apg?t=3432) second wave feminists uh which say that  
[0:57:15](https://youtu.be/iyWFulQ7apg?t=3435) there should be legality uh complete um  
[0:57:18](https://youtu.be/iyWFulQ7apg?t=3438) equality exactly like the same man and  
[0:57:20](https://youtu.be/iyWFulQ7apg?t=3440) woman we don't believe that we believe  
[0:57:22](https://youtu.be/iyWFulQ7apg?t=3442) that  
[0:57:23](https://youtu.be/iyWFulQ7apg?t=3443) there should be a complementarity okay  
[0:57:25](https://youtu.be/iyWFulQ7apg?t=3445) we believe in we don't believe in um  
[0:57:28](https://youtu.be/iyWFulQ7apg?t=3448) egality we believe in complementarity  
[0:57:30](https://youtu.be/iyWFulQ7apg?t=3450) yeah and so  
[0:57:32](https://youtu.be/iyWFulQ7apg?t=3452) yeah yeah just to add to that um  
[0:57:36](https://youtu.be/iyWFulQ7apg?t=3456) even if we take their line their  
[0:57:38](https://youtu.be/iyWFulQ7apg?t=3458) standard line of how  
[0:57:40](https://youtu.be/iyWFulQ7apg?t=3460) we came about society was never  
[0:57:43](https://youtu.be/iyWFulQ7apg?t=3463) egalitarian  
[0:57:46](https://youtu.be/iyWFulQ7apg?t=3466) in fact evolutionary psychologists find  
[0:57:48](https://youtu.be/iyWFulQ7apg?t=3468) themselves completely at odds with  
[0:57:50](https://youtu.be/iyWFulQ7apg?t=3470) feminist  
[0:57:51](https://youtu.be/iyWFulQ7apg?t=3471) and egalitarian values  
[0:57:54](https://youtu.be/iyWFulQ7apg?t=3474) so for example toxic masculinity  
[0:57:58](https://youtu.be/iyWFulQ7apg?t=3478) is something that some evolutionary  
[0:58:00](https://youtu.be/iyWFulQ7apg?t=3480) psychologists see  
[0:58:01](https://youtu.be/iyWFulQ7apg?t=3481) a function for likewise gender roles  
[0:58:04](https://youtu.be/iyWFulQ7apg?t=3484) there's a function for that there's a  
[0:58:06](https://youtu.be/iyWFulQ7apg?t=3486) reason why natural selection  
[0:58:08](https://youtu.be/iyWFulQ7apg?t=3488) according to them has shaped  
[0:58:12](https://youtu.be/iyWFulQ7apg?t=3492) uh patriarchal societies um so  
[0:58:15](https://youtu.be/iyWFulQ7apg?t=3495) i i think what we need to be clear about  
[0:58:17](https://youtu.be/iyWFulQ7apg?t=3497) and what what uh  
[0:58:18](https://youtu.be/iyWFulQ7apg?t=3498) hijab was saying earlier our paradigm is  
[0:58:20](https://youtu.be/iyWFulQ7apg?t=3500) not like this so when we say  
[0:58:22](https://youtu.be/iyWFulQ7apg?t=3502) equality when we say this or we say that  
[0:58:25](https://youtu.be/iyWFulQ7apg?t=3505) we don't mean the same thing that's  
[0:58:27](https://youtu.be/iyWFulQ7apg?t=3507) right they mean something totally  
[0:58:28](https://youtu.be/iyWFulQ7apg?t=3508) different  
[0:58:29](https://youtu.be/iyWFulQ7apg?t=3509) but what's important to know is that we  
[0:58:32](https://youtu.be/iyWFulQ7apg?t=3512) have a basis and the basis is the quran  
[0:58:34](https://youtu.be/iyWFulQ7apg?t=3514) and the sunnah  
[0:58:35](https://youtu.be/iyWFulQ7apg?t=3515) now technically allah could have said  
[0:58:37](https://youtu.be/iyWFulQ7apg?t=3517) the man gets half the inheritance  
[0:58:39](https://youtu.be/iyWFulQ7apg?t=3519) that the woman gets from it we would  
[0:58:42](https://youtu.be/iyWFulQ7apg?t=3522) accept it because that's what allah said  
[0:58:43](https://youtu.be/iyWFulQ7apg?t=3523) but allah said the opposite  
[0:58:45](https://youtu.be/iyWFulQ7apg?t=3525) or allah could have said something  
[0:58:46](https://youtu.be/iyWFulQ7apg?t=3526) totally different the thing is a  
[0:58:48](https://youtu.be/iyWFulQ7apg?t=3528) memonist can read the quran and say the  
[0:58:49](https://youtu.be/iyWFulQ7apg?t=3529) quran is unfair towards men  
[0:58:51](https://youtu.be/iyWFulQ7apg?t=3531) because men have to go to war and men  
[0:58:54](https://youtu.be/iyWFulQ7apg?t=3534) have to die and men have to do the  
[0:58:55](https://youtu.be/iyWFulQ7apg?t=3535) difficult jobs and they have to write a  
[0:58:57](https://youtu.be/iyWFulQ7apg?t=3537) feminist can read the quran and say  
[0:58:59](https://youtu.be/iyWFulQ7apg?t=3539) the quran is against women because of  
[0:59:00](https://youtu.be/iyWFulQ7apg?t=3540) this verse and that verse allah does no  
[0:59:02](https://youtu.be/iyWFulQ7apg?t=3542) injustice to anyone but what's very  
[0:59:04](https://youtu.be/iyWFulQ7apg?t=3544) important my brother is our lens our  
[0:59:06](https://youtu.be/iyWFulQ7apg?t=3546) starting paradigm  
[0:59:08](https://youtu.be/iyWFulQ7apg?t=3548) is that we submit to the commands of  
[0:59:11](https://youtu.be/iyWFulQ7apg?t=3551) allah  
[0:59:12](https://youtu.be/iyWFulQ7apg?t=3552) and our understanding of equality our  
[0:59:14](https://youtu.be/iyWFulQ7apg?t=3554) understanding of what is just  
[0:59:16](https://youtu.be/iyWFulQ7apg?t=3556) is what allah has decided it's not a  
[0:59:19](https://youtu.be/iyWFulQ7apg?t=3559) human  
[0:59:20](https://youtu.be/iyWFulQ7apg?t=3560) construct because if you look at their  
[0:59:22](https://youtu.be/iyWFulQ7apg?t=3562) narratives  
[0:59:23](https://youtu.be/iyWFulQ7apg?t=3563) which is this is what we mean by  
[0:59:24](https://youtu.be/iyWFulQ7apg?t=3564) equality oh really is that what you mean  
[0:59:26](https://youtu.be/iyWFulQ7apg?t=3566) by equality  
[0:59:27](https://youtu.be/iyWFulQ7apg?t=3567) how did this develop you start to see  
[0:59:29](https://youtu.be/iyWFulQ7apg?t=3569) that actually  
[0:59:30](https://youtu.be/iyWFulQ7apg?t=3570) their terms are undefined their  
[0:59:32](https://youtu.be/iyWFulQ7apg?t=3572) arguments are unrefined as well  
[0:59:35](https://youtu.be/iyWFulQ7apg?t=3575) and they are completely at odds with  
[0:59:37](https://youtu.be/iyWFulQ7apg?t=3577) each other in terms of origins  
[0:59:39](https://youtu.be/iyWFulQ7apg?t=3579) of of of these particular values and  
[0:59:42](https://youtu.be/iyWFulQ7apg?t=3582) their implications in society today  
[0:59:44](https://youtu.be/iyWFulQ7apg?t=3584) so if you have this argument down with  
[0:59:47](https://youtu.be/iyWFulQ7apg?t=3587) patriarchy  
[0:59:48](https://youtu.be/iyWFulQ7apg?t=3588) great downward patriarchy but did a  
[0:59:50](https://youtu.be/iyWFulQ7apg?t=3590) natural selection according to you  
[0:59:52](https://youtu.be/iyWFulQ7apg?t=3592) design patriarchy to create societies  
[0:59:56](https://youtu.be/iyWFulQ7apg?t=3596) which have social cohesion  
[0:59:58](https://youtu.be/iyWFulQ7apg?t=3598) and this is extremely important to  
[1:00:00](https://youtu.be/iyWFulQ7apg?t=3600) understand that whether you're muslim or  
[1:00:01](https://youtu.be/iyWFulQ7apg?t=3601) not muslim  
[1:00:02](https://youtu.be/iyWFulQ7apg?t=3602) you're muslim but the muslim narrative  
[1:00:05](https://youtu.be/iyWFulQ7apg?t=3605) is coherent  
[1:00:07](https://youtu.be/iyWFulQ7apg?t=3607) and it's a rival to the other narrative  
[1:00:09](https://youtu.be/iyWFulQ7apg?t=3609) but the other  
[1:00:10](https://youtu.be/iyWFulQ7apg?t=3610) narrative is incoherent in in of itself  
[1:00:14](https://youtu.be/iyWFulQ7apg?t=3614) there is a fundamental problem with the  
[1:00:16](https://youtu.be/iyWFulQ7apg?t=3616) idea  
[1:00:17](https://youtu.be/iyWFulQ7apg?t=3617) that natural selection shaped our  
[1:00:19](https://youtu.be/iyWFulQ7apg?t=3619) psychological mechanisms  
[1:00:21](https://youtu.be/iyWFulQ7apg?t=3621) and our values and our ethics and all of  
[1:00:23](https://youtu.be/iyWFulQ7apg?t=3623) these things and  
[1:00:25](https://youtu.be/iyWFulQ7apg?t=3625) the egalitarian ideas because you cannot  
[1:00:28](https://youtu.be/iyWFulQ7apg?t=3628) find  
[1:00:29](https://youtu.be/iyWFulQ7apg?t=3629) those egalitarian ideas when you look at  
[1:00:31](https://youtu.be/iyWFulQ7apg?t=3631) evolutionary history  
[1:00:32](https://youtu.be/iyWFulQ7apg?t=3632) unless you start to do some cherry  
[1:00:34](https://youtu.be/iyWFulQ7apg?t=3634) picking and saying well bonobos are like  
[1:00:36](https://youtu.be/iyWFulQ7apg?t=3636) this  
[1:00:36](https://youtu.be/iyWFulQ7apg?t=3636) but let's ignore the chimps you know  
[1:00:38](https://youtu.be/iyWFulQ7apg?t=3638) stuff like that  
[1:00:40](https://youtu.be/iyWFulQ7apg?t=3640) cool thank you thank you very much  
[1:00:44](https://youtu.be/iyWFulQ7apg?t=3644) okay next is the guy with the doc i  
[1:00:46](https://youtu.be/iyWFulQ7apg?t=3646) don't i don't even know how to pronounce  
[1:00:47](https://youtu.be/iyWFulQ7apg?t=3647) that  
[1:00:52](https://youtu.be/iyWFulQ7apg?t=3652) so my question is about islamic ruling  
[1:00:54](https://youtu.be/iyWFulQ7apg?t=3654) so  
[1:00:55](https://youtu.be/iyWFulQ7apg?t=3655) uh so so so sorry  
[1:00:59](https://youtu.be/iyWFulQ7apg?t=3659) i guess  
[1:01:03](https://youtu.be/iyWFulQ7apg?t=3663) then 21 it says uh you shouldn't marry  
[1:01:05](https://youtu.be/iyWFulQ7apg?t=3665) the policies basically  
[1:01:07](https://youtu.be/iyWFulQ7apg?t=3667) talking to men a muslim man and then  
[1:01:10](https://youtu.be/iyWFulQ7apg?t=3670) there is uh  
[1:01:11](https://youtu.be/iyWFulQ7apg?t=3671) yeah and then it's in surah 5  
[1:01:16](https://youtu.be/iyWFulQ7apg?t=3676) verse 5 it says you're allowed to marry  
[1:01:17](https://youtu.be/iyWFulQ7apg?t=3677) christians  
[1:01:19](https://youtu.be/iyWFulQ7apg?t=3679) and i know as far as they say christians  
[1:01:21](https://youtu.be/iyWFulQ7apg?t=3681) are politics  
[1:01:23](https://youtu.be/iyWFulQ7apg?t=3683) the worship to god's elementary  
[1:01:26](https://youtu.be/iyWFulQ7apg?t=3686) okay so just before that brother

[1:02:12](https://youtu.be/iyWFulQ7apg?t=3732) this question yeah  
[1:02:13](https://youtu.be/iyWFulQ7apg?t=3733) yeah just leave them on because we might  
[1:02:15](https://youtu.be/iyWFulQ7apg?t=3735) need to probe  
[1:02:17](https://youtu.be/iyWFulQ7apg?t=3737) yeah look i think that uh you have to  
[1:02:20](https://youtu.be/iyWFulQ7apg?t=3740) understand that there are  
[1:02:22](https://youtu.be/iyWFulQ7apg?t=3742) first of all if this is an attempt to  
[1:02:23](https://youtu.be/iyWFulQ7apg?t=3743) try and show there's an inconsistency of  
[1:02:26](https://youtu.be/iyWFulQ7apg?t=3746) quran the problem is  
[1:02:29](https://youtu.be/iyWFulQ7apg?t=3749) with identifying contradictions and  
[1:02:31](https://youtu.be/iyWFulQ7apg?t=3751) inconsistencies  
[1:02:33](https://youtu.be/iyWFulQ7apg?t=3753) and what one has to do is they have to  
[1:02:34](https://youtu.be/iyWFulQ7apg?t=3754) know what a contradiction inconsistency  
[1:02:36](https://youtu.be/iyWFulQ7apg?t=3756) actually is  
[1:02:37](https://youtu.be/iyWFulQ7apg?t=3757) when the quran says you know  
[1:02:40](https://youtu.be/iyWFulQ7apg?t=3760) in chapter four if this was  
[1:02:48](https://youtu.be/iyWFulQ7apg?t=3768) many contradictions what is a  
[1:02:51](https://youtu.be/iyWFulQ7apg?t=3771) contradiction is something which is  
[1:02:53](https://youtu.be/iyWFulQ7apg?t=3773) irreconcilable it's completely  
[1:02:54](https://youtu.be/iyWFulQ7apg?t=3774) unreconciled you cannot reconcile it  
[1:02:57](https://youtu.be/iyWFulQ7apg?t=3777) and you can pick up like for example the  
[1:02:59](https://youtu.be/iyWFulQ7apg?t=3779) logic handbook  
[1:03:00](https://youtu.be/iyWFulQ7apg?t=3780) by uh halbach it's a it's a book  
[1:03:03](https://youtu.be/iyWFulQ7apg?t=3783) and there is definitions of what  
[1:03:05](https://youtu.be/iyWFulQ7apg?t=3785) contradictions are  
[1:03:06](https://youtu.be/iyWFulQ7apg?t=3786) and you'll find in it there's no way in  
[1:03:08](https://youtu.be/iyWFulQ7apg?t=3788) which for example this is a  
[1:03:09](https://youtu.be/iyWFulQ7apg?t=3789) propositional logic or whatever yeah but  
[1:03:11](https://youtu.be/iyWFulQ7apg?t=3791) it still applies to our context here and  
[1:03:13](https://youtu.be/iyWFulQ7apg?t=3793) he defines it  
[1:03:15](https://youtu.be/iyWFulQ7apg?t=3795) someone's obviously not muslim whatever  
[1:03:17](https://youtu.be/iyWFulQ7apg?t=3797) but this is the kind of book that they  
[1:03:19](https://youtu.be/iyWFulQ7apg?t=3799) probably read  
[1:03:20](https://youtu.be/iyWFulQ7apg?t=3800) in um undergraduate  
[1:03:23](https://youtu.be/iyWFulQ7apg?t=3803) philosophy courses contradiction is  
[1:03:25](https://youtu.be/iyWFulQ7apg?t=3805) something which there is no way  
[1:03:26](https://youtu.be/iyWFulQ7apg?t=3806) of harmonizing and there's no way of  
[1:03:28](https://youtu.be/iyWFulQ7apg?t=3808) trying reconciling  
[1:03:30](https://youtu.be/iyWFulQ7apg?t=3810) it and obviously something which is  
[1:03:32](https://youtu.be/iyWFulQ7apg?t=3812) apparently contradictory can  
[1:03:34](https://youtu.be/iyWFulQ7apg?t=3814) be not contradictory yeah so for  
[1:03:36](https://youtu.be/iyWFulQ7apg?t=3816) instance in this situation  
[1:03:38](https://youtu.be/iyWFulQ7apg?t=3818) the general the general ruling is that  
[1:03:41](https://youtu.be/iyWFulQ7apg?t=3821) you don't  
[1:03:42](https://youtu.be/iyWFulQ7apg?t=3822) marry polytheists but the the exception  
[1:03:45](https://youtu.be/iyWFulQ7apg?t=3825) only proves the rule it doesn't there's  
[1:03:47](https://youtu.be/iyWFulQ7apg?t=3827) most rules that exist out there whether  
[1:03:49](https://youtu.be/iyWFulQ7apg?t=3829) even mathematical or scientific or any  
[1:03:52](https://youtu.be/iyWFulQ7apg?t=3832) polite high there any actual principle  
[1:03:54](https://youtu.be/iyWFulQ7apg?t=3834) you're gonna find exceptions  
[1:03:56](https://youtu.be/iyWFulQ7apg?t=3836) and so that's why you have something  
[1:03:57](https://youtu.be/iyWFulQ7apg?t=3837) called and also  
[1:04:00](https://youtu.be/iyWFulQ7apg?t=3840) these are two terms that also is the uh  
[1:04:03](https://youtu.be/iyWFulQ7apg?t=3843) scholars of jurisprudence they put into  
[1:04:05](https://youtu.be/iyWFulQ7apg?t=3845) place because  
[1:04:07](https://youtu.be/iyWFulQ7apg?t=3847) we're talking and on on the flip side as  
[1:04:10](https://youtu.be/iyWFulQ7apg?t=3850) well  
[1:04:11](https://youtu.be/iyWFulQ7apg?t=3851) is something which is generic but then  
[1:04:12](https://youtu.be/iyWFulQ7apg?t=3852) you have something which is  
[1:04:14](https://youtu.be/iyWFulQ7apg?t=3854) which are very similar but different  
[1:04:16](https://youtu.be/iyWFulQ7apg?t=3856) terms which define the specific  
[1:04:18](https://youtu.be/iyWFulQ7apg?t=3858) exception for those things  
[1:04:20](https://youtu.be/iyWFulQ7apg?t=3860) so what you've defined is okay the quran  
[1:04:24](https://youtu.be/iyWFulQ7apg?t=3864) says  
[1:04:38](https://youtu.be/iyWFulQ7apg?t=3878) and even if you like her but then  
[1:04:41](https://youtu.be/iyWFulQ7apg?t=3881) it's almighty that it says that you can  
[1:04:43](https://youtu.be/iyWFulQ7apg?t=3883) marry these so that's the exception you  
[1:04:44](https://youtu.be/iyWFulQ7apg?t=3884) can marry jews and christians  
[1:04:45](https://youtu.be/iyWFulQ7apg?t=3885) that is the exception for men that is  
[1:04:48](https://youtu.be/iyWFulQ7apg?t=3888) the exception not for women women cannot  
[1:04:49](https://youtu.be/iyWFulQ7apg?t=3889) marry jews and christians  
[1:04:51](https://youtu.be/iyWFulQ7apg?t=3891) but men can marry jews and christians  
[1:04:53](https://youtu.be/iyWFulQ7apg?t=3893) okay some scholars say today this  
[1:04:55](https://youtu.be/iyWFulQ7apg?t=3895) doesn't apply because of the issues  
[1:04:58](https://youtu.be/iyWFulQ7apg?t=3898) said and so on and so forth and some  
[1:05:00](https://youtu.be/iyWFulQ7apg?t=3900) discussions that's  
[1:05:01](https://youtu.be/iyWFulQ7apg?t=3901) aside the point but from a consistency  
[1:05:04](https://youtu.be/iyWFulQ7apg?t=3904) perspective there's no contradiction  
[1:05:05](https://youtu.be/iyWFulQ7apg?t=3905) yeah because it can be harmonized when  
[1:05:08](https://youtu.be/iyWFulQ7apg?t=3908) we talk about generalities and  
[1:05:09](https://youtu.be/iyWFulQ7apg?t=3909) specificities yeah sorry i'm gonna  
[1:05:11](https://youtu.be/iyWFulQ7apg?t=3911) uh just move on from there just simply  
[1:05:13](https://youtu.be/iyWFulQ7apg?t=3913) because  
[1:05:15](https://youtu.be/iyWFulQ7apg?t=3915) we have a lot of people uh so brother  
[1:05:17](https://youtu.be/iyWFulQ7apg?t=3917) faisal  
[1:05:18](https://youtu.be/iyWFulQ7apg?t=3918) because we booted you out earlier i'm  
[1:05:20](https://youtu.be/iyWFulQ7apg?t=3920) just gonna  
[1:05:30](https://youtu.be/iyWFulQ7apg?t=3930) okay um so my question is regarding  
[1:05:32](https://youtu.be/iyWFulQ7apg?t=3932) human history more or less from  
[1:05:34](https://youtu.be/iyWFulQ7apg?t=3934) the islamic perspective there are  
[1:05:37](https://youtu.be/iyWFulQ7apg?t=3937) two texts from the hadith that kind of  
[1:05:41](https://youtu.be/iyWFulQ7apg?t=3941) leave me with some questions the first  
[1:05:43](https://youtu.be/iyWFulQ7apg?t=3943) one is regarding  
[1:05:44](https://youtu.be/iyWFulQ7apg?t=3944) a hadith that says that adam ali salam  
[1:05:47](https://youtu.be/iyWFulQ7apg?t=3947) when he was  
[1:05:48](https://youtu.be/iyWFulQ7apg?t=3948) created he was created 60 cubits tall  
[1:05:51](https://youtu.be/iyWFulQ7apg?t=3951) and even he used to interpret this as  
[1:05:54](https://youtu.be/iyWFulQ7apg?t=3954) meaning that he was 60 cubits tall when  
[1:05:57](https://youtu.be/iyWFulQ7apg?t=3957) he was on earth already and humans  
[1:05:59](https://youtu.be/iyWFulQ7apg?t=3959) declined in  
[1:06:00](https://youtu.be/iyWFulQ7apg?t=3960) height since then  
[1:06:03](https://youtu.be/iyWFulQ7apg?t=3963) the other point is in regards to the  
[1:06:07](https://youtu.be/iyWFulQ7apg?t=3967) hadith that describe the amount of time  
[1:06:11](https://youtu.be/iyWFulQ7apg?t=3971) between prophets  
[1:06:12](https://youtu.be/iyWFulQ7apg?t=3972) there are certain hadith which talk  
[1:06:15](https://youtu.be/iyWFulQ7apg?t=3975) about  
[1:06:16](https://youtu.be/iyWFulQ7apg?t=3976) 10 generations being between uh adam and  
[1:06:19](https://youtu.be/iyWFulQ7apg?t=3979) no  
[1:06:19](https://youtu.be/iyWFulQ7apg?t=3979) and another anihim salam and another  
[1:06:22](https://youtu.be/iyWFulQ7apg?t=3982) hadith uh describing another ten  
[1:06:24](https://youtu.be/iyWFulQ7apg?t=3984) generations between  
[1:06:25](https://youtu.be/iyWFulQ7apg?t=3985) noor and ibrahim  
[1:06:28](https://youtu.be/iyWFulQ7apg?t=3988) and i find that a bit like uh confusing  
[1:06:31](https://youtu.be/iyWFulQ7apg?t=3991) uh when we look at human history uh from  
[1:06:33](https://youtu.be/iyWFulQ7apg?t=3993) a scientific  
[1:06:34](https://youtu.be/iyWFulQ7apg?t=3994) scientific perspective obviously and uh  
[1:06:37](https://youtu.be/iyWFulQ7apg?t=3997) yeah i  
[1:06:38](https://youtu.be/iyWFulQ7apg?t=3998) would really enjoy if you could comment  
[1:06:40](https://youtu.be/iyWFulQ7apg?t=4000) comments on that i'm actually  
[1:06:41](https://youtu.be/iyWFulQ7apg?t=4001) i'm actually gonna be writing something  
[1:06:43](https://youtu.be/iyWFulQ7apg?t=4003) on this but i'll give you a brief answer  
[1:06:45](https://youtu.be/iyWFulQ7apg?t=4005) inshallah um now in regards to  
[1:06:49](https://youtu.be/iyWFulQ7apg?t=4009) the um what was the first point that you  
[1:06:52](https://youtu.be/iyWFulQ7apg?t=4012) made  
[1:06:53](https://youtu.be/iyWFulQ7apg?t=4013) on the uh the height of adam islam  
[1:06:56](https://youtu.be/iyWFulQ7apg?t=4016) that's some  
[1:06:56](https://youtu.be/iyWFulQ7apg?t=4016) which i'm not going to address now  
[1:06:58](https://youtu.be/iyWFulQ7apg?t=4018) that's something which i want to write  
[1:06:59](https://youtu.be/iyWFulQ7apg?t=4019) about because that's something that  
[1:07:00](https://youtu.be/iyWFulQ7apg?t=4020) could easily go wrong  
[1:07:02](https://youtu.be/iyWFulQ7apg?t=4022) um we're going to make a video about  
[1:07:04](https://youtu.be/iyWFulQ7apg?t=4024) that as well  
[1:07:05](https://youtu.be/iyWFulQ7apg?t=4025) with the second point um i've covered  
[1:07:08](https://youtu.be/iyWFulQ7apg?t=4028) this a few times in the past but again  
[1:07:10](https://youtu.be/iyWFulQ7apg?t=4030) inshallah this is something i'm going to  
[1:07:11](https://youtu.be/iyWFulQ7apg?t=4031) be writing about  
[1:07:13](https://youtu.be/iyWFulQ7apg?t=4033) what it is that when we say human as  
[1:07:16](https://youtu.be/iyWFulQ7apg?t=4036) muslims  
[1:07:17](https://youtu.be/iyWFulQ7apg?t=4037) we simply mean bani adam that's what we  
[1:07:19](https://youtu.be/iyWFulQ7apg?t=4039) mean but when a scientist says human  
[1:07:22](https://youtu.be/iyWFulQ7apg?t=4042) they will include homo erectus homo  
[1:07:25](https://youtu.be/iyWFulQ7apg?t=4045) naladi denizovens  
[1:07:27](https://youtu.be/iyWFulQ7apg?t=4047) you know anything  
[1:07:30](https://youtu.be/iyWFulQ7apg?t=4050) within the you know anything hominid  
[1:07:33](https://youtu.be/iyWFulQ7apg?t=4053) they would they would just say  
[1:07:34](https://youtu.be/iyWFulQ7apg?t=4054) right this is a human so when it comes  
[1:07:37](https://youtu.be/iyWFulQ7apg?t=4057) to  
[1:07:37](https://youtu.be/iyWFulQ7apg?t=4057) us um humans from their perspective  
[1:07:41](https://youtu.be/iyWFulQ7apg?t=4061) we go back millions of years at least  
[1:07:43](https://youtu.be/iyWFulQ7apg?t=4063) two million years  
[1:07:44](https://youtu.be/iyWFulQ7apg?t=4064) right um hundreds of thousands  
[1:07:47](https://youtu.be/iyWFulQ7apg?t=4067) definitely our  
[1:07:48](https://youtu.be/iyWFulQ7apg?t=4068) species of human but from a islamic  
[1:07:51](https://youtu.be/iyWFulQ7apg?t=4071) quranic perspective  
[1:07:53](https://youtu.be/iyWFulQ7apg?t=4073) we believe in the creation of adam islam  
[1:07:56](https://youtu.be/iyWFulQ7apg?t=4076) being a  
[1:07:57](https://youtu.be/iyWFulQ7apg?t=4077) miraculous creation and the human beings  
[1:07:58](https://youtu.be/iyWFulQ7apg?t=4078) alive today being part of that  
[1:08:00](https://youtu.be/iyWFulQ7apg?t=4080) now prior to that or maybe at the same  
[1:08:03](https://youtu.be/iyWFulQ7apg?t=4083) time there were other  
[1:08:04](https://youtu.be/iyWFulQ7apg?t=4084) hominid type things that existed um  
[1:08:07](https://youtu.be/iyWFulQ7apg?t=4087) that's possible  
[1:08:08](https://youtu.be/iyWFulQ7apg?t=4088) um that's not that's not i mean there's  
[1:08:10](https://youtu.be/iyWFulQ7apg?t=4090) no textual evidence that goes against  
[1:08:13](https://youtu.be/iyWFulQ7apg?t=4093) that  
[1:08:13](https://youtu.be/iyWFulQ7apg?t=4093) but um why do we actually believe  
[1:08:17](https://youtu.be/iyWFulQ7apg?t=4097) that all of human beings today are  
[1:08:20](https://youtu.be/iyWFulQ7apg?t=4100) actually creations and they're not part  
[1:08:22](https://youtu.be/iyWFulQ7apg?t=4102) of the same  
[1:08:23](https://youtu.be/iyWFulQ7apg?t=4103) line of humans from the perspective  
[1:08:25](https://youtu.be/iyWFulQ7apg?t=4105) assigned to speak about  
[1:08:26](https://youtu.be/iyWFulQ7apg?t=4106) is because we believe in the miracle of  
[1:08:28](https://youtu.be/iyWFulQ7apg?t=4108) adam islam  
[1:08:30](https://youtu.be/iyWFulQ7apg?t=4110) and the miracle of adam islam as allah  
[1:08:32](https://youtu.be/iyWFulQ7apg?t=4112) says in the quran is like that of  
[1:08:34](https://youtu.be/iyWFulQ7apg?t=4114) isa so we say as muslims  
[1:08:38](https://youtu.be/iyWFulQ7apg?t=4118) and i've covered this in my debate with  
[1:08:40](https://youtu.be/iyWFulQ7apg?t=4120) aaron and a few other times as well  
[1:08:42](https://youtu.be/iyWFulQ7apg?t=4122) we say okay homo erectus these other  
[1:08:45](https://youtu.be/iyWFulQ7apg?t=4125) things they existed  
[1:08:46](https://youtu.be/iyWFulQ7apg?t=4126) but we say that our lineage begins with  
[1:08:49](https://youtu.be/iyWFulQ7apg?t=4129) adam al-islam  
[1:08:50](https://youtu.be/iyWFulQ7apg?t=4130) what was the exact time again that's  
[1:08:52](https://youtu.be/iyWFulQ7apg?t=4132) something  
[1:08:53](https://youtu.be/iyWFulQ7apg?t=4133) which um i i believe there is some work  
[1:08:57](https://youtu.be/iyWFulQ7apg?t=4137) which has been done  
[1:08:58](https://youtu.be/iyWFulQ7apg?t=4138) done on this i don't think it's  
[1:08:59](https://youtu.be/iyWFulQ7apg?t=4139) sufficient enough  
[1:09:01](https://youtu.be/iyWFulQ7apg?t=4141) yet and that's something inshallah that  
[1:09:03](https://youtu.be/iyWFulQ7apg?t=4143) i'm looking to develop as well  
[1:09:05](https://youtu.be/iyWFulQ7apg?t=4145) but i'm not going to give you a longer  
[1:09:07](https://youtu.be/iyWFulQ7apg?t=4147) answer than that because that's usually  
[1:09:08](https://youtu.be/iyWFulQ7apg?t=4148) the way i  
[1:09:09](https://youtu.be/iyWFulQ7apg?t=4149) add something to this uh there are some  
[1:09:11](https://youtu.be/iyWFulQ7apg?t=4151) just on both of the things that you've  
[1:09:13](https://youtu.be/iyWFulQ7apg?t=4153) mentioned  
[1:09:13](https://youtu.be/iyWFulQ7apg?t=4153) um uh in terms of the if you're taking  
[1:09:17](https://youtu.be/iyWFulQ7apg?t=4157) the view that was on this earth  
[1:09:18](https://youtu.be/iyWFulQ7apg?t=4158) there are some rewards that say it was  
[1:09:20](https://youtu.be/iyWFulQ7apg?t=4160) in the heaven by the way  
[1:09:23](https://youtu.be/iyWFulQ7apg?t=4163) now because we're doing a video on this  
[1:09:25](https://youtu.be/iyWFulQ7apg?t=4165) i want to save that to the video that  
[1:09:27](https://youtu.be/iyWFulQ7apg?t=4167) we're going to do i'm going to put on  
[1:09:28](https://youtu.be/iyWFulQ7apg?t=4168) sapient thoughts  
[1:09:29](https://youtu.be/iyWFulQ7apg?t=4169) um what i what i found in regards to  
[1:09:31](https://youtu.be/iyWFulQ7apg?t=4171) this at least to the issue of the height  
[1:09:33](https://youtu.be/iyWFulQ7apg?t=4173) right is that  
[1:09:34](https://youtu.be/iyWFulQ7apg?t=4174) ibn used to interpret this hadith in a  
[1:09:37](https://youtu.be/iyWFulQ7apg?t=4177) different way  
[1:09:39](https://youtu.be/iyWFulQ7apg?t=4179) which might be interesting to you just  
[1:09:40](https://youtu.be/iyWFulQ7apg?t=4180) for your research  
[1:09:42](https://youtu.be/iyWFulQ7apg?t=4182) i have discussed this issue with farid  
[1:09:43](https://youtu.be/iyWFulQ7apg?t=4183) once  
[1:09:45](https://youtu.be/iyWFulQ7apg?t=4185) quite some time ago uh so that might be  
[1:09:47](https://youtu.be/iyWFulQ7apg?t=4187) interesting to you just so  
[1:09:49](https://youtu.be/iyWFulQ7apg?t=4189) but i don't remember how he i i remember  
[1:09:51](https://youtu.be/iyWFulQ7apg?t=4191) actually seeing it  
[1:09:53](https://youtu.be/iyWFulQ7apg?t=4193) with in it that he is  
[1:09:56](https://youtu.be/iyWFulQ7apg?t=4196) 60 cubits and then it says something  
[1:09:58](https://youtu.be/iyWFulQ7apg?t=4198) like this  
[1:10:00](https://youtu.be/iyWFulQ7apg?t=4200) where allah created him into heaven and  
[1:10:01](https://youtu.be/iyWFulQ7apg?t=4201) i'll have to check this because if this  
[1:10:03](https://youtu.be/iyWFulQ7apg?t=4203) is the case and  
[1:10:04](https://youtu.be/iyWFulQ7apg?t=4204) and this is where i have to double check  
[1:10:05](https://youtu.be/iyWFulQ7apg?t=4205) it before i give you a an answer of the  
[1:10:07](https://youtu.be/iyWFulQ7apg?t=4207) riweia  
[1:10:08](https://youtu.be/iyWFulQ7apg?t=4208) uh and i have to take it to the people  
[1:10:10](https://youtu.be/iyWFulQ7apg?t=4210) of hadith and see if this is checking up  
[1:10:12](https://youtu.be/iyWFulQ7apg?t=4212) or not  
[1:10:13](https://youtu.be/iyWFulQ7apg?t=4213) uh if this is the case then obviously it  
[1:10:14](https://youtu.be/iyWFulQ7apg?t=4214) solves the issue completely because  
[1:10:16](https://youtu.be/iyWFulQ7apg?t=4216) we know that the parameters in heaven  
[1:10:19](https://youtu.be/iyWFulQ7apg?t=4219) are completely different to the  
[1:10:20](https://youtu.be/iyWFulQ7apg?t=4220) primaries on the earth  
[1:10:21](https://youtu.be/iyWFulQ7apg?t=4221) so that would be one way but the other  
[1:10:22](https://youtu.be/iyWFulQ7apg?t=4222) and the other uh instance that you  
[1:10:24](https://youtu.be/iyWFulQ7apg?t=4224) mentioned here  
[1:10:27](https://youtu.be/iyWFulQ7apg?t=4227) about between north  
[1:10:36](https://youtu.be/iyWFulQ7apg?t=4236) we have something in the quran actually  
[1:10:38](https://youtu.be/iyWFulQ7apg?t=4238) and i just  
[1:10:39](https://youtu.be/iyWFulQ7apg?t=4239) pulled it out because i remember that  
[1:10:42](https://youtu.be/iyWFulQ7apg?t=4242) make sure i get that verse  
[1:10:43](https://youtu.be/iyWFulQ7apg?t=4243) so this is in chapter number 25 verse  
[1:10:47](https://youtu.be/iyWFulQ7apg?t=4247) number 37  
[1:10:57](https://youtu.be/iyWFulQ7apg?t=4257) and then says and this is the crucial  
[1:10:59](https://youtu.be/iyWFulQ7apg?t=4259) part  
[1:11:09](https://youtu.be/iyWFulQ7apg?t=4269) and the dwellers and many generations in  
[1:11:13](https://youtu.be/iyWFulQ7apg?t=4273) between now  
[1:11:13](https://youtu.be/iyWFulQ7apg?t=4273) obviously in the arabic is  
[1:11:17](https://youtu.be/iyWFulQ7apg?t=4277) um is defined in a certain way so it's  
[1:11:20](https://youtu.be/iyWFulQ7apg?t=4280) actually more than  
[1:11:21](https://youtu.be/iyWFulQ7apg?t=4281) uh a certain number i believe it's more  
[1:11:23](https://youtu.be/iyWFulQ7apg?t=4283) than ten i believe it is more than ten  
[1:11:25](https://youtu.be/iyWFulQ7apg?t=4285) it could be ten or more could be nine or  
[1:11:26](https://youtu.be/iyWFulQ7apg?t=4286) more i think there was a different  
[1:11:27](https://youtu.be/iyWFulQ7apg?t=4287) opinion  
[1:11:28](https://youtu.be/iyWFulQ7apg?t=4288) but that's that is the extent of it  
[1:11:30](https://youtu.be/iyWFulQ7apg?t=4290) that's the strongest thing that we have  
[1:11:32](https://youtu.be/iyWFulQ7apg?t=4292) from from noah because here if you look  
[1:11:35](https://youtu.be/iyWFulQ7apg?t=4295) at the verse is what he was saying right  
[1:11:37](https://youtu.be/iyWFulQ7apg?t=4297) look at verse number 37 37 it says  
[1:11:41](https://youtu.be/iyWFulQ7apg?t=4301) so we have noah lemma  
[1:11:48](https://youtu.be/iyWFulQ7apg?t=4308) and we made them for the people  
[1:12:07](https://youtu.be/iyWFulQ7apg?t=4327) is referring to between noah and the  
[1:12:09](https://youtu.be/iyWFulQ7apg?t=4329) mood and adam  
[1:12:10](https://youtu.be/iyWFulQ7apg?t=4330) we have more than uh 10 generations  
[1:12:14](https://youtu.be/iyWFulQ7apg?t=4334) in terms of the the uh the wayat that  
[1:12:17](https://youtu.be/iyWFulQ7apg?t=4337) you may have  
[1:12:19](https://youtu.be/iyWFulQ7apg?t=4339) i don't know what the everywhere you  
[1:12:21](https://youtu.be/iyWFulQ7apg?t=4341) might have but obviously between adam  
[1:12:23](https://youtu.be/iyWFulQ7apg?t=4343) and noah i don't think there's anything  
[1:12:24](https://youtu.be/iyWFulQ7apg?t=4344) authentic uh yeah i also heard that this  
[1:12:27](https://youtu.be/iyWFulQ7apg?t=4347) hadith  
[1:12:28](https://youtu.be/iyWFulQ7apg?t=4348) might have some weakness in it yeah i  
[1:12:30](https://youtu.be/iyWFulQ7apg?t=4350) don't think between  
[1:12:31](https://youtu.be/iyWFulQ7apg?t=4351) and there's anything authentic from what  
[1:12:34](https://youtu.be/iyWFulQ7apg?t=4354) from the  
[1:12:35](https://youtu.be/iyWFulQ7apg?t=4355) once again i have to do the research  
[1:12:36](https://youtu.be/iyWFulQ7apg?t=4356) again but from what i remember from adam  
[1:12:39](https://youtu.be/iyWFulQ7apg?t=4359) until now there's nothing authentic and  
[1:12:41](https://youtu.be/iyWFulQ7apg?t=4361) so  
[1:12:42](https://youtu.be/iyWFulQ7apg?t=4362) usually what people take is they take  
[1:12:44](https://youtu.be/iyWFulQ7apg?t=4364) and i remember this because i was  
[1:12:45](https://youtu.be/iyWFulQ7apg?t=4365) reading in  
[1:12:49](https://youtu.be/iyWFulQ7apg?t=4369) and when he starts talking about the  
[1:12:51](https://youtu.be/iyWFulQ7apg?t=4371) prophets he starts saying  
[1:12:52](https://youtu.be/iyWFulQ7apg?t=4372) that noah the son of this person the son  
[1:12:55](https://youtu.be/iyWFulQ7apg?t=4375) of this person  
[1:12:56](https://youtu.be/iyWFulQ7apg?t=4376) and he uses the bible now why would he  
[1:12:58](https://youtu.be/iyWFulQ7apg?t=4378) use the bible  
[1:12:59](https://youtu.be/iyWFulQ7apg?t=4379) if there was a ruaya that was it would  
[1:13:02](https://youtu.be/iyWFulQ7apg?t=4382) make no sense to me so  
[1:13:03](https://youtu.be/iyWFulQ7apg?t=4383) if he's using the israelite that would  
[1:13:06](https://youtu.be/iyWFulQ7apg?t=4386) for me be an indication that he's trying  
[1:13:07](https://youtu.be/iyWFulQ7apg?t=4387) to fill in gaps  
[1:13:08](https://youtu.be/iyWFulQ7apg?t=4388) so i don't know of anything  
[1:13:11](https://youtu.be/iyWFulQ7apg?t=4391) but i don't know of anything authentic  
[1:13:13](https://youtu.be/iyWFulQ7apg?t=4393) between adam  
[1:13:15](https://youtu.be/iyWFulQ7apg?t=4395) and noah and this is this is the major  
[1:13:18](https://youtu.be/iyWFulQ7apg?t=4398) bone of contention  
[1:13:19](https://youtu.be/iyWFulQ7apg?t=4399) uh we don't know when adam was but we  
[1:13:22](https://youtu.be/iyWFulQ7apg?t=4402) know that he was a miraculous creation  
[1:13:23](https://youtu.be/iyWFulQ7apg?t=4403) and one more thing i want to add and  
[1:13:24](https://youtu.be/iyWFulQ7apg?t=4404) this is something i thought linda lucy  
[1:13:25](https://youtu.be/iyWFulQ7apg?t=4405) actually said  
[1:13:26](https://youtu.be/iyWFulQ7apg?t=4406) and i think it was a beautiful way of  
[1:13:28](https://youtu.be/iyWFulQ7apg?t=4408) the whole like um  
[1:13:29](https://youtu.be/iyWFulQ7apg?t=4409) darwinian thing with the whole evolution  
[1:13:31](https://youtu.be/iyWFulQ7apg?t=4411) thing really being put into perspective  
[1:13:32](https://youtu.be/iyWFulQ7apg?t=4412) and kind of adds to what you were saying  
[1:13:34](https://youtu.be/iyWFulQ7apg?t=4414) he said look uh i'm gonna give him  
[1:13:38](https://youtu.be/iyWFulQ7apg?t=4418) credit for this because he said this and  
[1:13:39](https://youtu.be/iyWFulQ7apg?t=4419) when he said it was like  
[1:13:40](https://youtu.be/iyWFulQ7apg?t=4420) the penny dropped the light was  
[1:13:41](https://youtu.be/iyWFulQ7apg?t=4421) beautiful it was a beautiful way to i  
[1:13:43](https://youtu.be/iyWFulQ7apg?t=4423) have to give him the credit for it  
[1:13:45](https://youtu.be/iyWFulQ7apg?t=4425) he said look you know islam yeah  
[1:13:49](https://youtu.be/iyWFulQ7apg?t=4429) you know he he had a clay bird and then  
[1:13:51](https://youtu.be/iyWFulQ7apg?t=4431) he blew into it and he made it  
[1:13:53](https://youtu.be/iyWFulQ7apg?t=4433) into a live bird do you know this  
[1:13:58](https://youtu.be/iyWFulQ7apg?t=4438) okay now that bird that he blew into  
[1:14:04](https://youtu.be/iyWFulQ7apg?t=4444) if we were now that that bird that was  
[1:14:06](https://youtu.be/iyWFulQ7apg?t=4446) once clay and then he blew  
[1:14:08](https://youtu.be/iyWFulQ7apg?t=4448) the raw or this or the  
[1:14:13](https://youtu.be/iyWFulQ7apg?t=4453) but he blew into it and it became an  
[1:14:15](https://youtu.be/iyWFulQ7apg?t=4455) actual bird  
[1:14:17](https://youtu.be/iyWFulQ7apg?t=4457) that bird if we had it the living  
[1:14:19](https://youtu.be/iyWFulQ7apg?t=4459) specimen of the bird and we dissected it  
[1:14:21](https://youtu.be/iyWFulQ7apg?t=4461) in whatever  
[1:14:22](https://youtu.be/iyWFulQ7apg?t=4462) and we looked at it would we be able to  
[1:14:23](https://youtu.be/iyWFulQ7apg?t=4463) classify it yeah we would be able to  
[1:14:25](https://youtu.be/iyWFulQ7apg?t=4465) classify it  
[1:14:27](https://youtu.be/iyWFulQ7apg?t=4467) in terms of what was it a pigeon what i  
[1:14:29](https://youtu.be/iyWFulQ7apg?t=4469) miss in this family and that family  
[1:14:30](https://youtu.be/iyWFulQ7apg?t=4470) whatever but in the real in reality is  
[1:14:32](https://youtu.be/iyWFulQ7apg?t=4472) it has a independent origin it was  
[1:14:34](https://youtu.be/iyWFulQ7apg?t=4474) spontaneously created by allah  
[1:14:36](https://youtu.be/iyWFulQ7apg?t=4476) yeah through whom through through isa  
[1:14:40](https://youtu.be/iyWFulQ7apg?t=4480) yeah okay so what's if this is in the  
[1:14:42](https://youtu.be/iyWFulQ7apg?t=4482) quran already and it's talking about  
[1:14:45](https://youtu.be/iyWFulQ7apg?t=4485) uh spontaneous creation from allah  
[1:14:48](https://youtu.be/iyWFulQ7apg?t=4488) of a bird that would have been  
[1:14:50](https://youtu.be/iyWFulQ7apg?t=4490) classified in a family tree with other  
[1:14:51](https://youtu.be/iyWFulQ7apg?t=4491) birds  
[1:14:54](https://youtu.be/iyWFulQ7apg?t=4494) you could say you could say that the  
[1:14:56](https://youtu.be/iyWFulQ7apg?t=4496) same thing with the human being  
[1:14:58](https://youtu.be/iyWFulQ7apg?t=4498) yes you could be able to classify a  
[1:14:59](https://youtu.be/iyWFulQ7apg?t=4499) human being as being a uh  
[1:15:01](https://youtu.be/iyWFulQ7apg?t=4501) hominid and this and that and whatever  
[1:15:02](https://youtu.be/iyWFulQ7apg?t=4502) primate and  
[1:15:04](https://youtu.be/iyWFulQ7apg?t=4504) whatever the technical terms are you'll  
[1:15:05](https://youtu.be/iyWFulQ7apg?t=4505) you'll know more than i do i don't want  
[1:15:06](https://youtu.be/iyWFulQ7apg?t=4506) to  
[1:15:07](https://youtu.be/iyWFulQ7apg?t=4507) say something wrong if  
[1:15:15](https://youtu.be/iyWFulQ7apg?t=4515) just like we're able to classify the  
[1:15:16](https://youtu.be/iyWFulQ7apg?t=4516) bird we believe look at the creation  
[1:15:19](https://youtu.be/iyWFulQ7apg?t=4519) story of adam  
[1:15:20](https://youtu.be/iyWFulQ7apg?t=4520) it's a miraculous story he was created  
[1:15:22](https://youtu.be/iyWFulQ7apg?t=4522) in heaven he was this  
[1:15:23](https://youtu.be/iyWFulQ7apg?t=4523) big and then he was sent to the yani  
[1:15:26](https://youtu.be/iyWFulQ7apg?t=4526) look at the uh  
[1:15:28](https://youtu.be/iyWFulQ7apg?t=4528) the black stone once again if you pull  
[1:15:30](https://youtu.be/iyWFulQ7apg?t=4530) out the black stone from the kaaba  
[1:15:32](https://youtu.be/iyWFulQ7apg?t=4532) will you be able to put it under a  
[1:15:34](https://youtu.be/iyWFulQ7apg?t=4534) microscope and see some minerals  
[1:15:36](https://youtu.be/iyWFulQ7apg?t=4536) yeah it it'll fit certain things they're  
[1:15:38](https://youtu.be/iyWFulQ7apg?t=4538) like okay this is this and whatever  
[1:15:39](https://youtu.be/iyWFulQ7apg?t=4539) yani but the truth of the matter is this  
[1:15:41](https://youtu.be/iyWFulQ7apg?t=4541) black stone came from heaven we believe  
[1:15:43](https://youtu.be/iyWFulQ7apg?t=4543) and another way of thinking about it and  
[1:15:45](https://youtu.be/iyWFulQ7apg?t=4545) this is a beautiful i mean he gave the  
[1:15:47](https://youtu.be/iyWFulQ7apg?t=4547) example of the word  
[1:15:48](https://youtu.be/iyWFulQ7apg?t=4548) many years ago sheikh abdul rahim green  
[1:15:50](https://youtu.be/iyWFulQ7apg?t=4550) was asked this question and he gave the  
[1:15:52](https://youtu.be/iyWFulQ7apg?t=4552) example  
[1:15:52](https://youtu.be/iyWFulQ7apg?t=4552) isa he said if you took out the genetics  
[1:15:54](https://youtu.be/iyWFulQ7apg?t=4554) of isa al-salam  
[1:15:56](https://youtu.be/iyWFulQ7apg?t=4556) you would say he is the father he is the  
[1:15:57](https://youtu.be/iyWFulQ7apg?t=4557) mother he is this his that but we know  
[1:15:59](https://youtu.be/iyWFulQ7apg?t=4559) he had no fathers  
[1:16:00](https://youtu.be/iyWFulQ7apg?t=4560) brilliant and allah says in the quran  
[1:16:02](https://youtu.be/iyWFulQ7apg?t=4562) the similitude of issa is like adam  
[1:16:04](https://youtu.be/iyWFulQ7apg?t=4564) yes now it's interesting that new  
[1:16:05](https://youtu.be/iyWFulQ7apg?t=4565) atheists hate both of them  
[1:16:07](https://youtu.be/iyWFulQ7apg?t=4567) they're normally ex-christians and they  
[1:16:10](https://youtu.be/iyWFulQ7apg?t=4570) darwinists right so they don't believe  
[1:16:11](https://youtu.be/iyWFulQ7apg?t=4571) in adam either  
[1:16:12](https://youtu.be/iyWFulQ7apg?t=4572) so um the the affirmation  
[1:16:16](https://youtu.be/iyWFulQ7apg?t=4576) um in terms of the miraculousness of  
[1:16:18](https://youtu.be/iyWFulQ7apg?t=4578) adam  
[1:16:19](https://youtu.be/iyWFulQ7apg?t=4579) islam and isa al-islam is is about their  
[1:16:22](https://youtu.be/iyWFulQ7apg?t=4582) independent origin like it wasn't like  
[1:16:25](https://youtu.be/iyWFulQ7apg?t=4585) you know they were completely  
[1:16:26](https://youtu.be/iyWFulQ7apg?t=4586) uh a natural part of the process and  
[1:16:28](https://youtu.be/iyWFulQ7apg?t=4588) this is why  
[1:16:29](https://youtu.be/iyWFulQ7apg?t=4589) this is exactly why one point cannot be  
[1:16:33](https://youtu.be/iyWFulQ7apg?t=4593) missed out  
[1:16:34](https://youtu.be/iyWFulQ7apg?t=4594) now i don't usually recommend certain  
[1:16:36](https://youtu.be/iyWFulQ7apg?t=4596) books on evolution because what  
[1:16:37](https://youtu.be/iyWFulQ7apg?t=4597) ends up happening is if you just give  
[1:16:39](https://youtu.be/iyWFulQ7apg?t=4599) people here go read this book on  
[1:16:40](https://youtu.be/iyWFulQ7apg?t=4600) evolution  
[1:16:41](https://youtu.be/iyWFulQ7apg?t=4601) then they come back a bit more confused  
[1:16:43](https://youtu.be/iyWFulQ7apg?t=4603) because they don't know to refute it and  
[1:16:45](https://youtu.be/iyWFulQ7apg?t=4605) you know you've just thrown me out there  
[1:16:47](https://youtu.be/iyWFulQ7apg?t=4607) but there's some really really good  
[1:16:48](https://youtu.be/iyWFulQ7apg?t=4608) books  
[1:16:48](https://youtu.be/iyWFulQ7apg?t=4608) philip johnson's book darwin on trial  
[1:16:51](https://youtu.be/iyWFulQ7apg?t=4611) in that book and it's old it's like 25  
[1:16:54](https://youtu.be/iyWFulQ7apg?t=4614) years old now  
[1:16:55](https://youtu.be/iyWFulQ7apg?t=4615) he makes the argument the fundamental  
[1:16:57](https://youtu.be/iyWFulQ7apg?t=4617) problem between darwinis and theists  
[1:17:01](https://youtu.be/iyWFulQ7apg?t=4621) is not human chimp ancestry is not  
[1:17:03](https://youtu.be/iyWFulQ7apg?t=4623) genetics anatomy psychology linguistics  
[1:17:06](https://youtu.be/iyWFulQ7apg?t=4626) is none of that fossil record  
[1:17:08](https://youtu.be/iyWFulQ7apg?t=4628) it is theism or naturalism  
[1:17:12](https://youtu.be/iyWFulQ7apg?t=4632) because if you come with a lens of  
[1:17:13](https://youtu.be/iyWFulQ7apg?t=4633) theism adamic  
[1:17:15](https://youtu.be/iyWFulQ7apg?t=4635) creation is possible but if you come  
[1:17:17](https://youtu.be/iyWFulQ7apg?t=4637) with a lens of naturalism  
[1:17:19](https://youtu.be/iyWFulQ7apg?t=4639) methodological naturalism a priori  
[1:17:22](https://youtu.be/iyWFulQ7apg?t=4642) meaning before evidence  
[1:17:24](https://youtu.be/iyWFulQ7apg?t=4644) it's impossible that adam al-islam  
[1:17:27](https://youtu.be/iyWFulQ7apg?t=4647) existed  
[1:17:27](https://youtu.be/iyWFulQ7apg?t=4647) so it's not the case that darwinists  
[1:17:30](https://youtu.be/iyWFulQ7apg?t=4650) have great evidence and it's all about  
[1:17:32](https://youtu.be/iyWFulQ7apg?t=4652) evidence no  
[1:17:33](https://youtu.be/iyWFulQ7apg?t=4653) the very lens of naturalism from which  
[1:17:35](https://youtu.be/iyWFulQ7apg?t=4655) they start the scientific journey  
[1:17:37](https://youtu.be/iyWFulQ7apg?t=4657) it rules out adam islam it rules out any  
[1:17:40](https://youtu.be/iyWFulQ7apg?t=4660) of these things  
[1:17:41](https://youtu.be/iyWFulQ7apg?t=4661) and what's beautiful about this is  
[1:17:43](https://youtu.be/iyWFulQ7apg?t=4663) thomas negro recently recently as in  
[1:17:45](https://youtu.be/iyWFulQ7apg?t=4665) just last  
[1:17:46](https://youtu.be/iyWFulQ7apg?t=4666) uh 10 years he published this book um  
[1:17:49](https://youtu.be/iyWFulQ7apg?t=4669) mind and cosmos and he openly states  
[1:17:53](https://youtu.be/iyWFulQ7apg?t=4673) that  
[1:17:53](https://youtu.be/iyWFulQ7apg?t=4673) you know the darwinian story is not just  
[1:17:57](https://youtu.be/iyWFulQ7apg?t=4677) evidence evidence evidence it actually  
[1:17:58](https://youtu.be/iyWFulQ7apg?t=4678) starts off with a  
[1:18:00](https://youtu.be/iyWFulQ7apg?t=4680) a priori philosophical lens and that  
[1:18:03](https://youtu.be/iyWFulQ7apg?t=4683) that obviously has implications so  
[1:18:06](https://youtu.be/iyWFulQ7apg?t=4686) that's extremely important to keep in  
[1:18:07](https://youtu.be/iyWFulQ7apg?t=4687) mind here as well when it comes to the  
[1:18:09](https://youtu.be/iyWFulQ7apg?t=4689) uh creation of adam al-islam but we've  
[1:18:11](https://youtu.be/iyWFulQ7apg?t=4691) covered this quite a bit  
[1:18:13](https://youtu.be/iyWFulQ7apg?t=4693) um let's move on to some other people  
[1:18:16](https://youtu.be/iyWFulQ7apg?t=4696) and i'm going to get hijab i'm a good  
[1:18:18](https://youtu.be/iyWFulQ7apg?t=4698) friend of hwasim i think you know which  
[1:18:20](https://youtu.be/iyWFulQ7apg?t=4700) one i'm talking about  
[1:18:22](https://youtu.be/iyWFulQ7apg?t=4702) was him from islamabad is the guy you  
[1:18:25](https://youtu.be/iyWFulQ7apg?t=4705) you have met  
[1:18:26](https://youtu.be/iyWFulQ7apg?t=4706) uh at the university there he helped you  
[1:18:28](https://youtu.be/iyWFulQ7apg?t=4708) with some stuff maybe you have forgotten  
[1:18:29](https://youtu.be/iyWFulQ7apg?t=4709) about him  
[1:18:31](https://youtu.be/iyWFulQ7apg?t=4711) his name again was him  
[1:18:34](https://youtu.be/iyWFulQ7apg?t=4714) oh yes yes yes of course mashaallah yeah  
[1:18:38](https://youtu.be/iyWFulQ7apg?t=4718) very good  
[1:18:46](https://youtu.be/iyWFulQ7apg?t=4726) so we're going to go to brother imran  
[1:18:49](https://youtu.be/iyWFulQ7apg?t=4729) next  
[1:18:51](https://youtu.be/iyWFulQ7apg?t=4731) and then  
[1:18:55](https://youtu.be/iyWFulQ7apg?t=4735) uh first of all i would like to thank  
[1:18:56](https://youtu.be/iyWFulQ7apg?t=4736) you for your work  
[1:18:58](https://youtu.be/iyWFulQ7apg?t=4738) it's really got me close to the dean and  
[1:19:01](https://youtu.be/iyWFulQ7apg?t=4741) my question it's it's kind of uh  
[1:19:04](https://youtu.be/iyWFulQ7apg?t=4744) relevant to  
[1:19:05](https://youtu.be/iyWFulQ7apg?t=4745) the last guy's question he asked about a  
[1:19:08](https://youtu.be/iyWFulQ7apg?t=4748) prophet adam al-salam's  
[1:19:10](https://youtu.be/iyWFulQ7apg?t=4750) height i'm asking about no hare sam's  
[1:19:14](https://youtu.be/iyWFulQ7apg?t=4754) age because we know from the quran it's  
[1:19:17](https://youtu.be/iyWFulQ7apg?t=4757) 950 years and  
[1:19:20](https://youtu.be/iyWFulQ7apg?t=4760) the history suggests that our uh  
[1:19:24](https://youtu.be/iyWFulQ7apg?t=4764) age expectancy has gotten higher with  
[1:19:26](https://youtu.be/iyWFulQ7apg?t=4766) medicine  
[1:19:28](https://youtu.be/iyWFulQ7apg?t=4768) but you know 950 years doesn't really  
[1:19:31](https://youtu.be/iyWFulQ7apg?t=4771) make sense  
[1:19:32](https://youtu.be/iyWFulQ7apg?t=4772) okay just for what we know so i'll give  
[1:19:34](https://youtu.be/iyWFulQ7apg?t=4774) it to you  
[1:19:35](https://youtu.be/iyWFulQ7apg?t=4775) yeah there's a very simple way of  
[1:19:36](https://youtu.be/iyWFulQ7apg?t=4776) answering that our age expectancy has  
[1:19:39](https://youtu.be/iyWFulQ7apg?t=4779) gone  
[1:19:40](https://youtu.be/iyWFulQ7apg?t=4780) up in the last couple of hundred years  
[1:19:42](https://youtu.be/iyWFulQ7apg?t=4782) because  
[1:19:43](https://youtu.be/iyWFulQ7apg?t=4783) of uh medicine because of a lack of  
[1:19:46](https://youtu.be/iyWFulQ7apg?t=4786) warfare more peaceful society so on and  
[1:19:49](https://youtu.be/iyWFulQ7apg?t=4789) so forth  
[1:19:50](https://youtu.be/iyWFulQ7apg?t=4790) but that says nothing about what would  
[1:19:52](https://youtu.be/iyWFulQ7apg?t=4792) have happened  
[1:19:53](https://youtu.be/iyWFulQ7apg?t=4793) uh what what what did happen much  
[1:19:56](https://youtu.be/iyWFulQ7apg?t=4796) earlier than that  
[1:19:57](https://youtu.be/iyWFulQ7apg?t=4797) so you have to remember the data is just  
[1:19:58](https://youtu.be/iyWFulQ7apg?t=4798) for the recent times now of course  
[1:20:00](https://youtu.be/iyWFulQ7apg?t=4800) scientists are just going to go by that  
[1:20:02](https://youtu.be/iyWFulQ7apg?t=4802) now when it comes to the fossil record  
[1:20:05](https://youtu.be/iyWFulQ7apg?t=4805) you know somebody can turn around and  
[1:20:06](https://youtu.be/iyWFulQ7apg?t=4806) say  
[1:20:06](https://youtu.be/iyWFulQ7apg?t=4806) well why why don't we have a situation  
[1:20:09](https://youtu.be/iyWFulQ7apg?t=4809) in which  
[1:20:09](https://youtu.be/iyWFulQ7apg?t=4809) we we have some fossils of humans who  
[1:20:13](https://youtu.be/iyWFulQ7apg?t=4813) uh lived for a very long time and why  
[1:20:15](https://youtu.be/iyWFulQ7apg?t=4815) don't we have  
[1:20:16](https://youtu.be/iyWFulQ7apg?t=4816) uh data for that the the important thing  
[1:20:19](https://youtu.be/iyWFulQ7apg?t=4819) to keep in mind is fossilization is  
[1:20:21](https://youtu.be/iyWFulQ7apg?t=4821) extremely rare  
[1:20:23](https://youtu.be/iyWFulQ7apg?t=4823) it is like lightning hitting a piece of  
[1:20:26](https://youtu.be/iyWFulQ7apg?t=4826) uh land it is so  
[1:20:29](https://youtu.be/iyWFulQ7apg?t=4829) rare that actually today um  
[1:20:32](https://youtu.be/iyWFulQ7apg?t=4832) weak and we can openly say this this is  
[1:20:34](https://youtu.be/iyWFulQ7apg?t=4834) uh stats according to the national  
[1:20:36](https://youtu.be/iyWFulQ7apg?t=4836) science foundation  
[1:20:39](https://youtu.be/iyWFulQ7apg?t=4839) 99.999  
[1:20:40](https://youtu.be/iyWFulQ7apg?t=4840) [Music]  
[1:20:41](https://youtu.be/iyWFulQ7apg?t=4841) of species not organisms species  
[1:20:44](https://youtu.be/iyWFulQ7apg?t=4844) that ever existed on earth they no  
[1:20:47](https://youtu.be/iyWFulQ7apg?t=4847) longer exist  
[1:20:48](https://youtu.be/iyWFulQ7apg?t=4848) and we do not have their fossils we  
[1:20:49](https://youtu.be/iyWFulQ7apg?t=4849) don't have their dna we don't have the  
[1:20:51](https://youtu.be/iyWFulQ7apg?t=4851) slightest  
[1:20:52](https://youtu.be/iyWFulQ7apg?t=4852) idea of what they look like the whole  
[1:20:55](https://youtu.be/iyWFulQ7apg?t=4855) reason why the age of nua alayhis salaam  
[1:20:57](https://youtu.be/iyWFulQ7apg?t=4857) has become an issue of why people try to  
[1:21:00](https://youtu.be/iyWFulQ7apg?t=4860) use it as an issue  
[1:21:01](https://youtu.be/iyWFulQ7apg?t=4861) is because of the misunderstanding  
[1:21:05](https://youtu.be/iyWFulQ7apg?t=4865) of how good a fossil record would have  
[1:21:07](https://youtu.be/iyWFulQ7apg?t=4867) been  
[1:21:08](https://youtu.be/iyWFulQ7apg?t=4868) and that record should be able to give a  
[1:21:11](https://youtu.be/iyWFulQ7apg?t=4871) certain evidence  
[1:21:12](https://youtu.be/iyWFulQ7apg?t=4872) and it's not actually giving us that  
[1:21:14](https://youtu.be/iyWFulQ7apg?t=4874) evidence and the other thing to keep in  
[1:21:16](https://youtu.be/iyWFulQ7apg?t=4876) mind  
[1:21:17](https://youtu.be/iyWFulQ7apg?t=4877) is that um at the time of nualis salaam  
[1:21:20](https://youtu.be/iyWFulQ7apg?t=4880) we're talking about the early generation  
[1:21:22](https://youtu.be/iyWFulQ7apg?t=4882) of  
[1:21:22](https://youtu.be/iyWFulQ7apg?t=4882) of the adamic line that the human  
[1:21:25](https://youtu.be/iyWFulQ7apg?t=4885) population was very low  
[1:21:26](https://youtu.be/iyWFulQ7apg?t=4886) and so um if if it's the case that for  
[1:21:29](https://youtu.be/iyWFulQ7apg?t=4889) example  
[1:21:30](https://youtu.be/iyWFulQ7apg?t=4890) there are people alive today there are  
[1:21:32](https://youtu.be/iyWFulQ7apg?t=4892) billions  
[1:21:33](https://youtu.be/iyWFulQ7apg?t=4893) of people alive today who have you could  
[1:21:36](https://youtu.be/iyWFulQ7apg?t=4896) say [ __ ] type features  
[1:21:38](https://youtu.be/iyWFulQ7apg?t=4898) not billions uh hundreds hundreds of  
[1:21:39](https://youtu.be/iyWFulQ7apg?t=4899) millions [ __ ] type features you get  
[1:21:42](https://youtu.be/iyWFulQ7apg?t=4902) this  
[1:21:42](https://youtu.be/iyWFulQ7apg?t=4902) in um you know uh what's it called  
[1:21:46](https://youtu.be/iyWFulQ7apg?t=4906) uzbekistan in tajikistan  
[1:21:48](https://youtu.be/iyWFulQ7apg?t=4908) and of course mongolia certain parts of  
[1:21:50](https://youtu.be/iyWFulQ7apg?t=4910) china  
[1:21:51](https://youtu.be/iyWFulQ7apg?t=4911) and so we can find fossils and we can  
[1:21:53](https://youtu.be/iyWFulQ7apg?t=4913) say okay these are [ __ ] type people  
[1:21:55](https://youtu.be/iyWFulQ7apg?t=4915) right because there's there's so many of  
[1:21:58](https://youtu.be/iyWFulQ7apg?t=4918) them and obviously some are going to  
[1:21:59](https://youtu.be/iyWFulQ7apg?t=4919) fossilize  
[1:22:00](https://youtu.be/iyWFulQ7apg?t=4920) but when you have such an early  
[1:22:02](https://youtu.be/iyWFulQ7apg?t=4922) generation of the adamic line and the  
[1:22:04](https://youtu.be/iyWFulQ7apg?t=4924) population is quite low  
[1:22:06](https://youtu.be/iyWFulQ7apg?t=4926) then not only is fossilization rare the  
[1:22:09](https://youtu.be/iyWFulQ7apg?t=4929) chances for fossilization  
[1:22:11](https://youtu.be/iyWFulQ7apg?t=4931) in that demographic is going to be  
[1:22:15](https://youtu.be/iyWFulQ7apg?t=4935) it's going to compound uh the  
[1:22:17](https://youtu.be/iyWFulQ7apg?t=4937) unlikelihood  
[1:22:18](https://youtu.be/iyWFulQ7apg?t=4938) of of finding such fossils so what's  
[1:22:21](https://youtu.be/iyWFulQ7apg?t=4941) important to keep in mind here  
[1:22:23](https://youtu.be/iyWFulQ7apg?t=4943) is that understanding the um the way  
[1:22:26](https://youtu.be/iyWFulQ7apg?t=4946) that science works in terms of  
[1:22:28](https://youtu.be/iyWFulQ7apg?t=4948) fossilization basically paleontology  
[1:22:30](https://youtu.be/iyWFulQ7apg?t=4950) and and uh how imperfect the fossil  
[1:22:33](https://youtu.be/iyWFulQ7apg?t=4953) record is  
[1:22:34](https://youtu.be/iyWFulQ7apg?t=4954) that completely undermines the argument  
[1:22:36](https://youtu.be/iyWFulQ7apg?t=4956) that this is not possible  
[1:22:38](https://youtu.be/iyWFulQ7apg?t=4958) um because this whole idea that human  
[1:22:40](https://youtu.be/iyWFulQ7apg?t=4960) beings  
[1:22:41](https://youtu.be/iyWFulQ7apg?t=4961) were living very short lives until just  
[1:22:44](https://youtu.be/iyWFulQ7apg?t=4964) recently  
[1:22:45](https://youtu.be/iyWFulQ7apg?t=4965) again that has a whole bunch of  
[1:22:46](https://youtu.be/iyWFulQ7apg?t=4966) presuppositions and we can challenge it  
[1:22:47](https://youtu.be/iyWFulQ7apg?t=4967) in the way that  
[1:22:48](https://youtu.be/iyWFulQ7apg?t=4968) yeah moreover the quran doesn't say he  
[1:22:51](https://youtu.be/iyWFulQ7apg?t=4971) lived for 950 years it actually says  
[1:22:53](https://youtu.be/iyWFulQ7apg?t=4973) he's like he'd done dawah for nine so he  
[1:22:55](https://youtu.be/iyWFulQ7apg?t=4975) could have lived longer  
[1:22:56](https://youtu.be/iyWFulQ7apg?t=4976) could have been three thousand years he  
[1:22:57](https://youtu.be/iyWFulQ7apg?t=4977) says  
[1:23:03](https://youtu.be/iyWFulQ7apg?t=4983) you know we have certainly sent noah to  
[1:23:05](https://youtu.be/iyWFulQ7apg?t=4985) his people so he stayed in there  
[1:23:06](https://youtu.be/iyWFulQ7apg?t=4986) with them for a thousand years minus 50  
[1:23:09](https://youtu.be/iyWFulQ7apg?t=4989) which is 9.50  
[1:23:11](https://youtu.be/iyWFulQ7apg?t=4991) so that's him doing that but the fact  
[1:23:12](https://youtu.be/iyWFulQ7apg?t=4992) that allah mentions it and he doesn't  
[1:23:14](https://youtu.be/iyWFulQ7apg?t=4994) mention how long  
[1:23:16](https://youtu.be/iyWFulQ7apg?t=4996) um any other prophet i from my  
[1:23:19](https://youtu.be/iyWFulQ7apg?t=4999) quick scan yanni any other prophet  
[1:23:22](https://youtu.be/iyWFulQ7apg?t=5002) uh stayed in their people would suggest  
[1:23:26](https://youtu.be/iyWFulQ7apg?t=5006) to me that it's unusual  
[1:23:27](https://youtu.be/iyWFulQ7apg?t=5007) that it was something that allah may be  
[1:23:30](https://youtu.be/iyWFulQ7apg?t=5010) bestowed to him that he didn't bestow to  
[1:23:31](https://youtu.be/iyWFulQ7apg?t=5011) other prophets  
[1:23:32](https://youtu.be/iyWFulQ7apg?t=5012) which is an extremely long life because  
[1:23:34](https://youtu.be/iyWFulQ7apg?t=5014) of the fact that  
[1:23:35](https://youtu.be/iyWFulQ7apg?t=5015) there was maybe an early community and  
[1:23:37](https://youtu.be/iyWFulQ7apg?t=5017) this we're talking about before the  
[1:23:38](https://youtu.be/iyWFulQ7apg?t=5018) cradle of the earth was even  
[1:23:39](https://youtu.be/iyWFulQ7apg?t=5019) established we're talking before  
[1:23:41](https://youtu.be/iyWFulQ7apg?t=5021) mesopotamia we're talking before  
[1:23:42](https://youtu.be/iyWFulQ7apg?t=5022) civilization  
[1:23:43](https://youtu.be/iyWFulQ7apg?t=5023) um egyptian civilization existed so  
[1:23:45](https://youtu.be/iyWFulQ7apg?t=5025) we're talking about really early early  
[1:23:47](https://youtu.be/iyWFulQ7apg?t=5027) early  
[1:23:48](https://youtu.be/iyWFulQ7apg?t=5028) uh stuff we don't know when we actually  
[1:23:50](https://youtu.be/iyWFulQ7apg?t=5030) don't know when so the fact that that  
[1:23:51](https://youtu.be/iyWFulQ7apg?t=5031) was the case there would have been a  
[1:23:53](https://youtu.be/iyWFulQ7apg?t=5033) very  
[1:23:53](https://youtu.be/iyWFulQ7apg?t=5033) scarce population and maybe even a  
[1:23:55](https://youtu.be/iyWFulQ7apg?t=5035) centralized population  
[1:23:57](https://youtu.be/iyWFulQ7apg?t=5037) all of it probably in the middle east  
[1:23:58](https://youtu.be/iyWFulQ7apg?t=5038) what was referred to in historical terms  
[1:24:00](https://youtu.be/iyWFulQ7apg?t=5040) as the cradle of the earth and therefore  
[1:24:03](https://youtu.be/iyWFulQ7apg?t=5043) one person would have been sufficient  
[1:24:06](https://youtu.be/iyWFulQ7apg?t=5046) but they just needed a very long space  
[1:24:08](https://youtu.be/iyWFulQ7apg?t=5048) of time uh  
[1:24:10](https://youtu.be/iyWFulQ7apg?t=5050) so it's possible yes right and the fact  
[1:24:12](https://youtu.be/iyWFulQ7apg?t=5052) that by the way the fact that  
[1:24:14](https://youtu.be/iyWFulQ7apg?t=5054) noah he says something he says that  
[1:24:17](https://youtu.be/iyWFulQ7apg?t=5057) um  
[1:24:26](https://youtu.be/iyWFulQ7apg?t=5066) i can't forget the but he says that they  
[1:24:28](https://youtu.be/iyWFulQ7apg?t=5068) will not give birth to  
[1:24:30](https://youtu.be/iyWFulQ7apg?t=5070) anyone except for someone's believe  
[1:24:33](https://youtu.be/iyWFulQ7apg?t=5073) someone who's a transgressor or  
[1:24:36](https://youtu.be/iyWFulQ7apg?t=5076) yeah uh and a disbeliever so  
[1:24:39](https://youtu.be/iyWFulQ7apg?t=5079) the why does he say this uh it's very  
[1:24:42](https://youtu.be/iyWFulQ7apg?t=5082) unusual because not another prophet  
[1:24:43](https://youtu.be/iyWFulQ7apg?t=5083) talks about  
[1:24:44](https://youtu.be/iyWFulQ7apg?t=5084) them giving birth to other people so the  
[1:24:45](https://youtu.be/iyWFulQ7apg?t=5085) idea that he mentioned  
[1:24:47](https://youtu.be/iyWFulQ7apg?t=5087) that their their followers would give  
[1:24:49](https://youtu.be/iyWFulQ7apg?t=5089) birth to disbelievers  
[1:24:51](https://youtu.be/iyWFulQ7apg?t=5091) could be from experience because he's  
[1:24:52](https://youtu.be/iyWFulQ7apg?t=5092) seen generations he's seen all these  
[1:24:54](https://youtu.be/iyWFulQ7apg?t=5094) generations  
[1:24:55](https://youtu.be/iyWFulQ7apg?t=5095) he's done a sociological analysis a  
[1:24:58](https://youtu.be/iyWFulQ7apg?t=5098) longitudinal study  
[1:24:59](https://youtu.be/iyWFulQ7apg?t=5099) because he saw what is it  
[1:25:02](https://youtu.be/iyWFulQ7apg?t=5102) yeah yeah okay

[1:25:29](https://youtu.be/iyWFulQ7apg?t=5129) of hijab so uh ibrah  
[1:25:32](https://youtu.be/iyWFulQ7apg?t=5132) then ibrahim no you don't need to do  
[1:25:35](https://youtu.be/iyWFulQ7apg?t=5135) anything you can just say next is  
[1:25:36](https://youtu.be/iyWFulQ7apg?t=5136) ibrahimo  
[1:25:37](https://youtu.be/iyWFulQ7apg?t=5137) and then they'll talk and then you say  
[1:25:39](https://youtu.be/iyWFulQ7apg?t=5139) next what's gonna do you don't do  
[1:25:40](https://youtu.be/iyWFulQ7apg?t=5140) anything but they're odd  
[1:25:41](https://youtu.be/iyWFulQ7apg?t=5141) oh they'll kill themselves okay yeah  
[1:25:45](https://youtu.be/iyWFulQ7apg?t=5145) all right all right  
[1:25:48](https://youtu.be/iyWFulQ7apg?t=5148) everyone how you doing  
[1:25:51](https://youtu.be/iyWFulQ7apg?t=5151) assalamu alaikum  
[1:25:55](https://youtu.be/iyWFulQ7apg?t=5155) okay so all right here's my question  
[1:26:01](https://youtu.be/iyWFulQ7apg?t=5161) in my area people are really  
[1:26:03](https://youtu.be/iyWFulQ7apg?t=5163) left-leaning  
[1:26:04](https://youtu.be/iyWFulQ7apg?t=5164) and of these kind of people there is a  
[1:26:05](https://youtu.be/iyWFulQ7apg?t=5165) muslim named mari turner she represents  
[1:26:08](https://youtu.be/iyWFulQ7apg?t=5168) oklahoma in the senate and identifies  
[1:26:10](https://youtu.be/iyWFulQ7apg?t=5170) gender-wise as a non-binary person  
[1:26:13](https://youtu.be/iyWFulQ7apg?t=5173) despite being a female  
[1:26:15](https://youtu.be/iyWFulQ7apg?t=5175) when i debate people now it usually  
[1:26:17](https://youtu.be/iyWFulQ7apg?t=5177) consists of liberals that believe in the  
[1:26:19](https://youtu.be/iyWFulQ7apg?t=5179) idea of a surplus of genders  
[1:26:21](https://youtu.be/iyWFulQ7apg?t=5181) my question to muhammad is knowing that  
[1:26:23](https://youtu.be/iyWFulQ7apg?t=5183) you deal with liberals often  
[1:26:25](https://youtu.be/iyWFulQ7apg?t=5185) is how should i islamically or generally  
[1:26:28](https://youtu.be/iyWFulQ7apg?t=5188) disprove the idea of more than two  
[1:26:30](https://youtu.be/iyWFulQ7apg?t=5190) genders  
[1:26:32](https://youtu.be/iyWFulQ7apg?t=5192) well i mean we believe in intersex we  
[1:26:34](https://youtu.be/iyWFulQ7apg?t=5194) don't have an issue with um  
[1:26:36](https://youtu.be/iyWFulQ7apg?t=5196) with that it's just for me my  
[1:26:38](https://youtu.be/iyWFulQ7apg?t=5198) interaction like for example i was in  
[1:26:40](https://youtu.be/iyWFulQ7apg?t=5200) the gender studies  
[1:26:40](https://youtu.be/iyWFulQ7apg?t=5200) um department uh for about a year in  
[1:26:43](https://youtu.be/iyWFulQ7apg?t=5203) sara's university and i remember having  
[1:26:45](https://youtu.be/iyWFulQ7apg?t=5205) a conversation with  
[1:26:47](https://youtu.be/iyWFulQ7apg?t=5207) with somebody and um and i had this  
[1:26:49](https://youtu.be/iyWFulQ7apg?t=5209) conversation i was uh  
[1:26:51](https://youtu.be/iyWFulQ7apg?t=5211) like we had seminars and obviously like  
[1:26:53](https://youtu.be/iyWFulQ7apg?t=5213) a lot of the people were there and  
[1:26:55](https://youtu.be/iyWFulQ7apg?t=5215) they're talking and stuff and  
[1:26:57](https://youtu.be/iyWFulQ7apg?t=5217) one person said to me she was obviously  
[1:26:59](https://youtu.be/iyWFulQ7apg?t=5219) like gender fluid or whatever she did  
[1:27:01](https://youtu.be/iyWFulQ7apg?t=5221) she believed that most of it was a  
[1:27:02](https://youtu.be/iyWFulQ7apg?t=5222) social construction  
[1:27:04](https://youtu.be/iyWFulQ7apg?t=5224) and she said um i believe that a penis  
[1:27:06](https://youtu.be/iyWFulQ7apg?t=5226) is a social construction  
[1:27:09](https://youtu.be/iyWFulQ7apg?t=5229) that's what she said to me i was like oh  
[1:27:10](https://youtu.be/iyWFulQ7apg?t=5230) is that what you believe she says yeah i  
[1:27:11](https://youtu.be/iyWFulQ7apg?t=5231) believe that  
[1:27:12](https://youtu.be/iyWFulQ7apg?t=5232) penis is social construction her peers  
[1:27:14](https://youtu.be/iyWFulQ7apg?t=5234) were like nodding along and this and  
[1:27:15](https://youtu.be/iyWFulQ7apg?t=5235) that  
[1:27:16](https://youtu.be/iyWFulQ7apg?t=5236) i was thinking okay so if you believe  
[1:27:18](https://youtu.be/iyWFulQ7apg?t=5238) that the  
[1:27:19](https://youtu.be/iyWFulQ7apg?t=5239) penis is a social construction i  
[1:27:22](https://youtu.be/iyWFulQ7apg?t=5242) remember that  
[1:27:24](https://youtu.be/iyWFulQ7apg?t=5244) actually i was like yeah so do you  
[1:27:25](https://youtu.be/iyWFulQ7apg?t=5245) believe rape is a social construction  
[1:27:29](https://youtu.be/iyWFulQ7apg?t=5249) and that's when the penny dropped  
[1:27:30](https://youtu.be/iyWFulQ7apg?t=5250) because if you start saying all these  
[1:27:31](https://youtu.be/iyWFulQ7apg?t=5251) things are social constructions  
[1:27:33](https://youtu.be/iyWFulQ7apg?t=5253) it opens up the pandora box of  
[1:27:35](https://youtu.be/iyWFulQ7apg?t=5255) ridiculousness  
[1:27:36](https://youtu.be/iyWFulQ7apg?t=5256) so you have to show them the extent to  
[1:27:38](https://youtu.be/iyWFulQ7apg?t=5258) which what they believe in  
[1:27:40](https://youtu.be/iyWFulQ7apg?t=5260) undermines like core values and certain  
[1:27:43](https://youtu.be/iyWFulQ7apg?t=5263) things that  
[1:27:44](https://youtu.be/iyWFulQ7apg?t=5264) they would probably believe in within  
[1:27:46](https://youtu.be/iyWFulQ7apg?t=5266) their framework of liberalism which is  
[1:27:47](https://youtu.be/iyWFulQ7apg?t=5267) in this case like racism  
[1:27:49](https://youtu.be/iyWFulQ7apg?t=5269) or sexism or uh rape or whatever it may  
[1:27:52](https://youtu.be/iyWFulQ7apg?t=5272) be  
[1:27:54](https://youtu.be/iyWFulQ7apg?t=5274) so you have to start and that's if you  
[1:27:57](https://youtu.be/iyWFulQ7apg?t=5277) watch  
[1:27:57](https://youtu.be/iyWFulQ7apg?t=5277) my i know it was a controversial  
[1:27:58](https://youtu.be/iyWFulQ7apg?t=5278) discussion but with the transgender  
[1:28:00](https://youtu.be/iyWFulQ7apg?t=5280) hijabi  
[1:28:01](https://youtu.be/iyWFulQ7apg?t=5281) i was trying to show that particular  
[1:28:03](https://youtu.be/iyWFulQ7apg?t=5283) transgender hijabi that  
[1:28:05](https://youtu.be/iyWFulQ7apg?t=5285) if everything is if biology becomes  
[1:28:07](https://youtu.be/iyWFulQ7apg?t=5287) socially constructed  
[1:28:09](https://youtu.be/iyWFulQ7apg?t=5289) then racism becomes a non-issue because  
[1:28:12](https://youtu.be/iyWFulQ7apg?t=5292) in as much the same way as you want to  
[1:28:14](https://youtu.be/iyWFulQ7apg?t=5294) say that there's two genders and that  
[1:28:15](https://youtu.be/iyWFulQ7apg?t=5295) they're socially constructed  
[1:28:18](https://youtu.be/iyWFulQ7apg?t=5298) we can say the same thing about race and  
[1:28:20](https://youtu.be/iyWFulQ7apg?t=5300) once we do that then we eliminate racism  
[1:28:22](https://youtu.be/iyWFulQ7apg?t=5302) because there's no such thing as racism  
[1:28:23](https://youtu.be/iyWFulQ7apg?t=5303) if there's no such thing as race  
[1:28:25](https://youtu.be/iyWFulQ7apg?t=5305) and it's from from those kinds of  
[1:28:29](https://youtu.be/iyWFulQ7apg?t=5309) you need to establish from them what  
[1:28:30](https://youtu.be/iyWFulQ7apg?t=5310) they accept as socially constructed and  
[1:28:32](https://youtu.be/iyWFulQ7apg?t=5312) what they accept is  
[1:28:33](https://youtu.be/iyWFulQ7apg?t=5313) objectively true and whatever they  
[1:28:35](https://youtu.be/iyWFulQ7apg?t=5315) accept or socially constructed  
[1:28:37](https://youtu.be/iyWFulQ7apg?t=5317) show them and you have to find out if  
[1:28:39](https://youtu.be/iyWFulQ7apg?t=5319) it's raised if it's if it's gender  
[1:28:41](https://youtu.be/iyWFulQ7apg?t=5321) whatever it show them that  
[1:28:42](https://youtu.be/iyWFulQ7apg?t=5322) how they believing in that causes more  
[1:28:44](https://youtu.be/iyWFulQ7apg?t=5324) problems for them  
[1:28:45](https://youtu.be/iyWFulQ7apg?t=5325) than it causes solutions in in much the  
[1:28:48](https://youtu.be/iyWFulQ7apg?t=5328) same way as i've kind of tried to show  
[1:28:50](https://youtu.be/iyWFulQ7apg?t=5330) right now so i would go down that route  
[1:28:52](https://youtu.be/iyWFulQ7apg?t=5332) here at bremer does that make sense  
[1:28:55](https://youtu.be/iyWFulQ7apg?t=5335) yeah that makes sense and even in my  
[1:28:56](https://youtu.be/iyWFulQ7apg?t=5336) civics class they're trying to teach us  
[1:28:58](https://youtu.be/iyWFulQ7apg?t=5338) that race is a social construction  
[1:29:00](https://youtu.be/iyWFulQ7apg?t=5340) then tell them uh so you're saying  
[1:29:02](https://youtu.be/iyWFulQ7apg?t=5342) there's no such thing as racism and that  
[1:29:04](https://youtu.be/iyWFulQ7apg?t=5344) you know there was no such thing as  
[1:29:05](https://youtu.be/iyWFulQ7apg?t=5345) race-based slavery because if race is a  
[1:29:07](https://youtu.be/iyWFulQ7apg?t=5347) social construction does  
[1:29:08](https://youtu.be/iyWFulQ7apg?t=5348) it doesn't actually exist in the real  
[1:29:10](https://youtu.be/iyWFulQ7apg?t=5350) world and show them the ridiculousness  
[1:29:12](https://youtu.be/iyWFulQ7apg?t=5352) of that and  
[1:29:12](https://youtu.be/iyWFulQ7apg?t=5352) uh yeah i mean if you're if you're  
[1:29:15](https://youtu.be/iyWFulQ7apg?t=5355) saying that then there's no such thing  
[1:29:16](https://youtu.be/iyWFulQ7apg?t=5356) as oppression to black people there's no  
[1:29:18](https://youtu.be/iyWFulQ7apg?t=5358) such thing as this and so and then  
[1:29:19](https://youtu.be/iyWFulQ7apg?t=5359) they'll start seeing the ridiculousness  
[1:29:20](https://youtu.be/iyWFulQ7apg?t=5360) of it and you'll get some people on your  
[1:29:22](https://youtu.be/iyWFulQ7apg?t=5362) side  
[1:29:23](https://youtu.be/iyWFulQ7apg?t=5363) and uh and and then you can move on from  
[1:29:25](https://youtu.be/iyWFulQ7apg?t=5365) there bro  
[1:29:26](https://youtu.be/iyWFulQ7apg?t=5366) all right well thank you i talked to my  
[1:29:29](https://youtu.be/iyWFulQ7apg?t=5369) mom about you a lot  
[1:29:30](https://youtu.be/iyWFulQ7apg?t=5370) yeah tell her attempt to make that for  
[1:29:32](https://youtu.be/iyWFulQ7apg?t=5372) me as well okay i will  
[1:29:34](https://youtu.be/iyWFulQ7apg?t=5374) thank you for  
[1:29:49](https://youtu.be/iyWFulQ7apg?t=5389) very well now william lam craig once  
[1:29:51](https://youtu.be/iyWFulQ7apg?t=5391) made a video  
[1:29:52](https://youtu.be/iyWFulQ7apg?t=5392) um talking about why he thinks that the  
[1:29:54](https://youtu.be/iyWFulQ7apg?t=5394) muslim concept of god fails  
[1:29:56](https://youtu.be/iyWFulQ7apg?t=5396) he goes on to say that he thinks that  
[1:29:58](https://youtu.be/iyWFulQ7apg?t=5398) the muslim cons  
[1:30:00](https://youtu.be/iyWFulQ7apg?t=5400) fails because he thinks that the muslim  
[1:30:03](https://youtu.be/iyWFulQ7apg?t=5403) concept of god is not the greatest  
[1:30:04](https://youtu.be/iyWFulQ7apg?t=5404) conceivable being because he thinks that  
[1:30:06](https://youtu.be/iyWFulQ7apg?t=5406) the greatest conceivable being  
[1:30:08](https://youtu.be/iyWFulQ7apg?t=5408) would be an all-loving his love would be  
[1:30:10](https://youtu.be/iyWFulQ7apg?t=5410) unconditional impartial and universal  
[1:30:13](https://youtu.be/iyWFulQ7apg?t=5413) and then he goes on to say that the love  
[1:30:14](https://youtu.be/iyWFulQ7apg?t=5414) of the quran the god in the quran  
[1:30:16](https://youtu.be/iyWFulQ7apg?t=5416) is partial conditional and is not  
[1:30:18](https://youtu.be/iyWFulQ7apg?t=5418) universal as you have to earn it as a  
[1:30:21](https://youtu.be/iyWFulQ7apg?t=5421) muslim  
[1:30:22](https://youtu.be/iyWFulQ7apg?t=5422) um and then he goes on to say because  
[1:30:24](https://youtu.be/iyWFulQ7apg?t=5424) god does not love sinners in the quran  
[1:30:26](https://youtu.be/iyWFulQ7apg?t=5426) william lane craig ended the video by  
[1:30:28](https://youtu.be/iyWFulQ7apg?t=5428) saying that he thinks that the concept  
[1:30:30](https://youtu.be/iyWFulQ7apg?t=5430) of god  
[1:30:31](https://youtu.be/iyWFulQ7apg?t=5431) in islam is morally enact inadequate  
[1:30:35](https://youtu.be/iyWFulQ7apg?t=5435) um how would you respond to that well uh  
[1:30:37](https://youtu.be/iyWFulQ7apg?t=5437) we  
[1:30:38](https://youtu.be/iyWFulQ7apg?t=5438) we have a paper that's coming out and um  
[1:30:40](https://youtu.be/iyWFulQ7apg?t=5440) dr othman latif has written an extensive  
[1:30:43](https://youtu.be/iyWFulQ7apg?t=5443) paper and i think he's even doing an  
[1:30:44](https://youtu.be/iyWFulQ7apg?t=5444) accompanying seminar  
[1:30:46](https://youtu.be/iyWFulQ7apg?t=5446) so i will i would just defer it to that  
[1:30:48](https://youtu.be/iyWFulQ7apg?t=5448) because i feel like  
[1:30:50](https://youtu.be/iyWFulQ7apg?t=5450) um he's got william lane craig has the  
[1:30:53](https://youtu.be/iyWFulQ7apg?t=5453) excuse of being my  
[1:30:55](https://youtu.be/iyWFulQ7apg?t=5455) academic senior uh  
[1:30:58](https://youtu.be/iyWFulQ7apg?t=5458) in not engaging with me he can say that  
[1:31:00](https://youtu.be/iyWFulQ7apg?t=5460) i'm his academic senior i'm double his  
[1:31:02](https://youtu.be/iyWFulQ7apg?t=5462) age in fact he's more than double my age  
[1:31:03](https://youtu.be/iyWFulQ7apg?t=5463) the guys  
[1:31:05](https://youtu.be/iyWFulQ7apg?t=5465) so i know whatever i say now it's not  
[1:31:07](https://youtu.be/iyWFulQ7apg?t=5467) really going to get his attention  
[1:31:09](https://youtu.be/iyWFulQ7apg?t=5469) whereas dr uthman lovely is on the same  
[1:31:12](https://youtu.be/iyWFulQ7apg?t=5472) level as him really academically like  
[1:31:14](https://youtu.be/iyWFulQ7apg?t=5474) you know he's got the same kind of  
[1:31:15](https://youtu.be/iyWFulQ7apg?t=5475) credentials  
[1:31:16](https://youtu.be/iyWFulQ7apg?t=5476) maybe he has not been around for as long  
[1:31:18](https://youtu.be/iyWFulQ7apg?t=5478) but uh they're both kind of colleagues  
[1:31:20](https://youtu.be/iyWFulQ7apg?t=5480) and  
[1:31:21](https://youtu.be/iyWFulQ7apg?t=5481) they would be colleagues in the same  
[1:31:22](https://youtu.be/iyWFulQ7apg?t=5482) kind of so he i feel like  
[1:31:24](https://youtu.be/iyWFulQ7apg?t=5484) that kind of alleviates him from being  
[1:31:26](https://youtu.be/iyWFulQ7apg?t=5486) able to make uh excuses for  
[1:31:28](https://youtu.be/iyWFulQ7apg?t=5488) engaging with that kind of uh polemic so  
[1:31:31](https://youtu.be/iyWFulQ7apg?t=5491) i want to defer that  
[1:31:33](https://youtu.be/iyWFulQ7apg?t=5493) to i want to defer that to dr athman  
[1:31:35](https://youtu.be/iyWFulQ7apg?t=5495) latiff's uh  
[1:31:36](https://youtu.be/iyWFulQ7apg?t=5496) his his seminar and his accompanying  
[1:31:39](https://youtu.be/iyWFulQ7apg?t=5499) paper which is  
[1:31:41](https://youtu.be/iyWFulQ7apg?t=5501) being reviewed now and he's actually  
[1:31:43](https://youtu.be/iyWFulQ7apg?t=5503) going to be a  
[1:31:44](https://youtu.be/iyWFulQ7apg?t=5504) complete dismantling of william lynn  
[1:31:46](https://youtu.be/iyWFulQ7apg?t=5506) craig's uh  
[1:31:47](https://youtu.be/iyWFulQ7apg?t=5507) but if you want to watch something for  
[1:31:48](https://youtu.be/iyWFulQ7apg?t=5508) the f for the night time or tomorrow or  
[1:31:50](https://youtu.be/iyWFulQ7apg?t=5510) something like this  
[1:31:52](https://youtu.be/iyWFulQ7apg?t=5512) then uh you can see that the podcast  
[1:31:54](https://youtu.be/iyWFulQ7apg?t=5514) i've done hamza sauces because we cook  
[1:31:55](https://youtu.be/iyWFulQ7apg?t=5515) about  
[1:31:56](https://youtu.be/iyWFulQ7apg?t=5516) actually in  
[1:31:59](https://youtu.be/iyWFulQ7apg?t=5519) [Music]  
[1:32:10](https://youtu.be/iyWFulQ7apg?t=5530) assalamualaikum  
[1:32:16](https://youtu.be/iyWFulQ7apg?t=5536) uh so my question you're probably tired  
[1:32:19](https://youtu.be/iyWFulQ7apg?t=5539) of hearing this already  
[1:32:20](https://youtu.be/iyWFulQ7apg?t=5540) you've heard this a lot but i have a  
[1:32:23](https://youtu.be/iyWFulQ7apg?t=5543) question concerning philosophy  
[1:32:25](https://youtu.be/iyWFulQ7apg?t=5545) right because  
[1:32:28](https://youtu.be/iyWFulQ7apg?t=5548) i want to go into because you guys use  
[1:32:30](https://youtu.be/iyWFulQ7apg?t=5550) philosophy for the purposes of  
[1:32:32](https://youtu.be/iyWFulQ7apg?t=5552) refuting yeah right  
[1:32:36](https://youtu.be/iyWFulQ7apg?t=5556) but there's always risks to using it  
[1:32:39](https://youtu.be/iyWFulQ7apg?t=5559) right as we've seen throughout  
[1:32:41](https://youtu.be/iyWFulQ7apg?t=5561) islamic history yes so  
[1:32:44](https://youtu.be/iyWFulQ7apg?t=5564) i would like an explanation  
[1:32:47](https://youtu.be/iyWFulQ7apg?t=5567) as to how do we avoid like  
[1:32:51](https://youtu.be/iyWFulQ7apg?t=5571) assimilating the two for example you may  
[1:32:53](https://youtu.be/iyWFulQ7apg?t=5573) use an argument  
[1:32:54](https://youtu.be/iyWFulQ7apg?t=5574) to say so subor maybe use an argument  
[1:32:58](https://youtu.be/iyWFulQ7apg?t=5578) from an evolutionary perspective yeah  
[1:33:01](https://youtu.be/iyWFulQ7apg?t=5581) but  
[1:33:01](https://youtu.be/iyWFulQ7apg?t=5581) obviously this may be contrary to islam  
[1:33:05](https://youtu.be/iyWFulQ7apg?t=5585) so how do we like avoid the simulation  
[1:33:09](https://youtu.be/iyWFulQ7apg?t=5589) between philosophy ideas we use as  
[1:33:12](https://youtu.be/iyWFulQ7apg?t=5592) you know just for the sake of  
[1:33:13](https://youtu.be/iyWFulQ7apg?t=5593) argumentation i've got a really  
[1:33:14](https://youtu.be/iyWFulQ7apg?t=5594) beautiful quotation here from  
[1:33:16](https://youtu.be/iyWFulQ7apg?t=5596) ibn tamiya which is from inheritance i  
[1:33:19](https://youtu.be/iyWFulQ7apg?t=5599) haven't actually said this before come  
[1:33:20](https://youtu.be/iyWFulQ7apg?t=5600) on  
[1:33:26](https://youtu.be/iyWFulQ7apg?t=5606) he says that if you want to kind of  
[1:33:29](https://youtu.be/iyWFulQ7apg?t=5609) uh negate philosophy altogether  
[1:33:33](https://youtu.be/iyWFulQ7apg?t=5613) or if you want to affirm all of it then  
[1:33:35](https://youtu.be/iyWFulQ7apg?t=5615) either of those two approaches are not  
[1:33:36](https://youtu.be/iyWFulQ7apg?t=5616) possible  
[1:33:37](https://youtu.be/iyWFulQ7apg?t=5617) yeah he says  
[1:33:45](https://youtu.be/iyWFulQ7apg?t=5625) no it's not one particular it's not like  
[1:33:47](https://youtu.be/iyWFulQ7apg?t=5627) one school of thought  
[1:33:53](https://youtu.be/iyWFulQ7apg?t=5633) i'm gonna share it right now for the  
[1:33:55](https://youtu.be/iyWFulQ7apg?t=5635) arabic freaking audiences  
[1:33:56](https://youtu.be/iyWFulQ7apg?t=5636) and they can uh hopefully  
[1:34:00](https://youtu.be/iyWFulQ7apg?t=5640) because a lot of people have  
[1:34:03](https://youtu.be/iyWFulQ7apg?t=5643) they think they argue on lines and  
[1:34:06](https://youtu.be/iyWFulQ7apg?t=5646) they get these kind of quotations from  
[1:34:10](https://youtu.be/iyWFulQ7apg?t=5650) share five translations uh  
[1:34:13](https://youtu.be/iyWFulQ7apg?t=5653) i'm gonna tweet this i put it on twitter  
[1:34:16](https://youtu.be/iyWFulQ7apg?t=5656) okay it's very  
[1:34:19](https://youtu.be/iyWFulQ7apg?t=5659) because is that right  
[1:34:22](https://youtu.be/iyWFulQ7apg?t=5662) yeah it's fine thank you very much  
[1:34:29](https://youtu.be/iyWFulQ7apg?t=5669) next we go to usman  
[1:34:33](https://youtu.be/iyWFulQ7apg?t=5673) can you hear me yes we can hang you how  
[1:34:36](https://youtu.be/iyWFulQ7apg?t=5676) are you doing  
[1:34:40](https://youtu.be/iyWFulQ7apg?t=5680) for your time um my question is um  
[1:34:44](https://youtu.be/iyWFulQ7apg?t=5684) considering the pandemic and the  
[1:34:48](https://youtu.be/iyWFulQ7apg?t=5688) um what's been going on the past year  
[1:34:50](https://youtu.be/iyWFulQ7apg?t=5690) bearing that in mind  
[1:34:51](https://youtu.be/iyWFulQ7apg?t=5691) like overnight my family a large segment  
[1:34:54](https://youtu.be/iyWFulQ7apg?t=5694) of my family a lot of muslims i know  
[1:34:56](https://youtu.be/iyWFulQ7apg?t=5696) some of them who actually grounded  
[1:34:57](https://youtu.be/iyWFulQ7apg?t=5697) within our tradition have become  
[1:35:00](https://youtu.be/iyWFulQ7apg?t=5700) conspiracy theorists  
[1:35:02](https://youtu.be/iyWFulQ7apg?t=5702) and i just wanted to ask that to what  
[1:35:04](https://youtu.be/iyWFulQ7apg?t=5704) extent  
[1:35:05](https://youtu.be/iyWFulQ7apg?t=5705) uh like principles or souls that we have  
[1:35:07](https://youtu.be/iyWFulQ7apg?t=5707) within the islamic tradition  
[1:35:09](https://youtu.be/iyWFulQ7apg?t=5709) such as um following following  
[1:35:12](https://youtu.be/iyWFulQ7apg?t=5712) the scholars people that have the  
[1:35:14](https://youtu.be/iyWFulQ7apg?t=5714) knowledge and following the consensus so  
[1:35:16](https://youtu.be/iyWFulQ7apg?t=5716) not just scholars but  
[1:35:18](https://youtu.be/iyWFulQ7apg?t=5718) following the consensus and  
[1:35:21](https://youtu.be/iyWFulQ7apg?t=5721) not questioning people's integrity  
[1:35:24](https://youtu.be/iyWFulQ7apg?t=5724) like having such severe skepticism where  
[1:35:26](https://youtu.be/iyWFulQ7apg?t=5726) you think everybody's evil  
[1:35:28](https://youtu.be/iyWFulQ7apg?t=5728) and doubting the integrity and these  
[1:35:31](https://youtu.be/iyWFulQ7apg?t=5731) kind of principles to what extent should  
[1:35:33](https://youtu.be/iyWFulQ7apg?t=5733) we apply these  
[1:35:34](https://youtu.be/iyWFulQ7apg?t=5734) principles to basically all other  
[1:35:36](https://youtu.be/iyWFulQ7apg?t=5736) aspects of our lives  
[1:35:38](https://youtu.be/iyWFulQ7apg?t=5738) yeah so brother osman i would say that  
[1:35:39](https://youtu.be/iyWFulQ7apg?t=5739) i'm sorry that question we can't answer  
[1:35:42](https://youtu.be/iyWFulQ7apg?t=5742) because it's not relevant to our remit  
[1:35:44](https://youtu.be/iyWFulQ7apg?t=5744) because we have a lot of questions in  
[1:35:45](https://youtu.be/iyWFulQ7apg?t=5745) regards to doubts about islam  
[1:35:47](https://youtu.be/iyWFulQ7apg?t=5747) uh but this is something that maybe you  
[1:35:49](https://youtu.be/iyWFulQ7apg?t=5749) can send to hijab on his instagram and  
[1:35:51](https://youtu.be/iyWFulQ7apg?t=5751) he can answer it  
[1:35:52](https://youtu.be/iyWFulQ7apg?t=5752) if you want but it's not something  
[1:35:55](https://youtu.be/iyWFulQ7apg?t=5755) relevant to the live stream so i won't  
[1:35:56](https://youtu.be/iyWFulQ7apg?t=5756) like i don't want to address that  
[1:36:00](https://youtu.be/iyWFulQ7apg?t=5760) okay okay  
[1:36:04](https://youtu.be/iyWFulQ7apg?t=5764) would you would you like to ask a  
[1:36:06](https://youtu.be/iyWFulQ7apg?t=5766) different question about doubt  
[1:36:08](https://youtu.be/iyWFulQ7apg?t=5768) and uh  
[1:36:11](https://youtu.be/iyWFulQ7apg?t=5771) the no to be honest the only other  
[1:36:13](https://youtu.be/iyWFulQ7apg?t=5773) question i would have  
[1:36:15](https://youtu.be/iyWFulQ7apg?t=5775) if within the same remit was for example  
[1:36:17](https://youtu.be/iyWFulQ7apg?t=5777) um  
[1:36:18](https://youtu.be/iyWFulQ7apg?t=5778) how do we understand that when adam ali  
[1:36:20](https://youtu.be/iyWFulQ7apg?t=5780) islam  
[1:36:21](https://youtu.be/iyWFulQ7apg?t=5781) or humanity comes from him then how do  
[1:36:24](https://youtu.be/iyWFulQ7apg?t=5784) we understand how  
[1:36:26](https://youtu.be/iyWFulQ7apg?t=5786) we claim so many from just two like how  
[1:36:29](https://youtu.be/iyWFulQ7apg?t=5789) did they  
[1:36:31](https://youtu.be/iyWFulQ7apg?t=5791) basically have children and have more  
[1:36:33](https://youtu.be/iyWFulQ7apg?t=5793) children within  
[1:36:34](https://youtu.be/iyWFulQ7apg?t=5794) the same family union well within  
[1:36:38](https://youtu.be/iyWFulQ7apg?t=5798) uh within the narrations that we have we  
[1:36:41](https://youtu.be/iyWFulQ7apg?t=5801) we know that it was a case of uh the  
[1:36:45](https://youtu.be/iyWFulQ7apg?t=5805) children of adam alayhis salaam  
[1:36:46](https://youtu.be/iyWFulQ7apg?t=5806) uh i believe it's the case that you had  
[1:36:49](https://youtu.be/iyWFulQ7apg?t=5809) two twins and two twin  
[1:36:51](https://youtu.be/iyWFulQ7apg?t=5811) and then one from uh one married the  
[1:36:54](https://youtu.be/iyWFulQ7apg?t=5814) other  
[1:36:54](https://youtu.be/iyWFulQ7apg?t=5814) i don't remember the i don't know if  
[1:36:56](https://youtu.be/iyWFulQ7apg?t=5816) there was a narration on that i think  
[1:36:58](https://youtu.be/iyWFulQ7apg?t=5818) that's what people  
[1:36:59](https://youtu.be/iyWFulQ7apg?t=5819) um they inferred from it but it was it  
[1:37:02](https://youtu.be/iyWFulQ7apg?t=5822) it was uh because remember their moral  
[1:37:04](https://youtu.be/iyWFulQ7apg?t=5824) variables are different because  
[1:37:06](https://youtu.be/iyWFulQ7apg?t=5826) morality or from an islamic perspective  
[1:37:09](https://youtu.be/iyWFulQ7apg?t=5829) is objective so  
[1:37:11](https://youtu.be/iyWFulQ7apg?t=5831) under a moral uh moral variable like  
[1:37:15](https://youtu.be/iyWFulQ7apg?t=5835) right now in the uk  
[1:37:17](https://youtu.be/iyWFulQ7apg?t=5837) pork eating pork is haram right or a  
[1:37:20](https://youtu.be/iyWFulQ7apg?t=5840) muslim  
[1:37:21](https://youtu.be/iyWFulQ7apg?t=5841) however if i was starving in a desert  
[1:37:23](https://youtu.be/iyWFulQ7apg?t=5843) then eating pork would be hello  
[1:37:25](https://youtu.be/iyWFulQ7apg?t=5845) so uh the classic islamic uh  
[1:37:29](https://youtu.be/iyWFulQ7apg?t=5849) narrative on this um and i i don't  
[1:37:32](https://youtu.be/iyWFulQ7apg?t=5852) believe there's  
[1:37:33](https://youtu.be/iyWFulQ7apg?t=5853) any disagreement in terms of muslim  
[1:37:35](https://youtu.be/iyWFulQ7apg?t=5855) scholarly opinion on this  
[1:37:37](https://youtu.be/iyWFulQ7apg?t=5857) was that this was something that the  
[1:37:39](https://youtu.be/iyWFulQ7apg?t=5859) children of adam al-islam intermarried  
[1:37:42](https://youtu.be/iyWFulQ7apg?t=5862) that's that's the standard line that's  
[1:37:44](https://youtu.be/iyWFulQ7apg?t=5864) always  
[1:37:45](https://youtu.be/iyWFulQ7apg?t=5865) actually been accepted i don't know of  
[1:37:48](https://youtu.be/iyWFulQ7apg?t=5868) any difference in opinion and then  
[1:37:50](https://youtu.be/iyWFulQ7apg?t=5870) how did they actually from such a small  
[1:37:53](https://youtu.be/iyWFulQ7apg?t=5873) number  
[1:37:54](https://youtu.be/iyWFulQ7apg?t=5874) become so large um that's just  
[1:37:57](https://youtu.be/iyWFulQ7apg?t=5877) you know survival reproduction over a  
[1:37:59](https://youtu.be/iyWFulQ7apg?t=5879) long period of time in fact  
[1:38:01](https://youtu.be/iyWFulQ7apg?t=5881) today um if we look at something like  
[1:38:04](https://youtu.be/iyWFulQ7apg?t=5884) the children of kangaskhan you know  
[1:38:06](https://youtu.be/iyWFulQ7apg?t=5886) there's there's literally tens of  
[1:38:07](https://youtu.be/iyWFulQ7apg?t=5887) millions of people  
[1:38:09](https://youtu.be/iyWFulQ7apg?t=5889) exactly yeah but how people can spot and  
[1:38:13](https://youtu.be/iyWFulQ7apg?t=5893) also i just want you to say something  
[1:38:14](https://youtu.be/iyWFulQ7apg?t=5894) else as well  
[1:38:15](https://youtu.be/iyWFulQ7apg?t=5895) you know in a colony uh and i know  
[1:38:18](https://youtu.be/iyWFulQ7apg?t=5898) hijabi and i love this  
[1:38:20](https://youtu.be/iyWFulQ7apg?t=5900) in a colony all of the  
[1:38:23](https://youtu.be/iyWFulQ7apg?t=5903) ants are actually puddling they will  
[1:38:26](https://youtu.be/iyWFulQ7apg?t=5906) have the same  
[1:38:27](https://youtu.be/iyWFulQ7apg?t=5907) all of them right so you know this whole  
[1:38:29](https://youtu.be/iyWFulQ7apg?t=5909) idea of oh how can there be so many  
[1:38:31](https://youtu.be/iyWFulQ7apg?t=5911) and how could they start off and how  
[1:38:33](https://youtu.be/iyWFulQ7apg?t=5913) could they all be sibling  
[1:38:34](https://youtu.be/iyWFulQ7apg?t=5914) well we have ants and your colonies and  
[1:38:37](https://youtu.be/iyWFulQ7apg?t=5917) this is exactly what takes place  
[1:38:39](https://youtu.be/iyWFulQ7apg?t=5919) in nature it's it's not i mean it's not  
[1:38:43](https://youtu.be/iyWFulQ7apg?t=5923) a uh  
[1:38:44](https://youtu.be/iyWFulQ7apg?t=5924) it's not inconceivable  
[1:38:47](https://youtu.be/iyWFulQ7apg?t=5927) um and obviously even from a  
[1:38:49](https://youtu.be/iyWFulQ7apg?t=5929) methodological naturalistic point of  
[1:38:51](https://youtu.be/iyWFulQ7apg?t=5931) view which i  
[1:38:52](https://youtu.be/iyWFulQ7apg?t=5932) spoke about earlier they they'll have to  
[1:38:55](https://youtu.be/iyWFulQ7apg?t=5935) come to a similar solvent  
[1:38:59](https://youtu.be/iyWFulQ7apg?t=5939) you know because everything goes back to  
[1:39:01](https://youtu.be/iyWFulQ7apg?t=5941) simplicity right so you know small  
[1:39:03](https://youtu.be/iyWFulQ7apg?t=5943) numbers becoming into large numbers  
[1:39:05](https://youtu.be/iyWFulQ7apg?t=5945) um and yeah that's the way i'd address  
[1:39:08](https://youtu.be/iyWFulQ7apg?t=5948) your question  
[1:39:10](https://youtu.be/iyWFulQ7apg?t=5950) the other  
[1:39:21](https://youtu.be/iyWFulQ7apg?t=5961) um so let's go to brother  
[1:39:48](https://youtu.be/iyWFulQ7apg?t=5988) so he was almost convinced about a lot  
[1:39:49](https://youtu.be/iyWFulQ7apg?t=5989) of things a lot of answers  
[1:39:55](https://youtu.be/iyWFulQ7apg?t=5995) you're very choppy it's very hard to  
[1:39:58](https://youtu.be/iyWFulQ7apg?t=5998) understand what you're saying  
[1:39:59](https://youtu.be/iyWFulQ7apg?t=5999) okay  
[1:40:03](https://youtu.be/iyWFulQ7apg?t=6003) can i can i i'm just going to remove you

[1:40:23](https://youtu.be/iyWFulQ7apg?t=6023) ask you a question but ask a bit slower  
[1:40:26](https://youtu.be/iyWFulQ7apg?t=6026) because you're you're speaking quite  
[1:40:27](https://youtu.be/iyWFulQ7apg?t=6027) fast and you couldn't understand you  
[1:40:29](https://youtu.be/iyWFulQ7apg?t=6029) okay so my question is uh

[1:41:06](https://youtu.be/iyWFulQ7apg?t=6066) brother honey

[1:41:14](https://youtu.be/iyWFulQ7apg?t=6074) uh let's go to brother jawad  
[1:41:21](https://youtu.be/iyWFulQ7apg?t=6081) so i have a question about following  
[1:41:25](https://youtu.be/iyWFulQ7apg?t=6085) school of thought and i joined this i  
[1:41:27](https://youtu.be/iyWFulQ7apg?t=6087) just saw this  
[1:41:30](https://youtu.be/iyWFulQ7apg?t=6090) this broadcast so i don't know the topic  
[1:41:32](https://youtu.be/iyWFulQ7apg?t=6092) but i had a question about  
[1:41:34](https://youtu.be/iyWFulQ7apg?t=6094) following school of thought that's not  
[1:41:36](https://youtu.be/iyWFulQ7apg?t=6096) that's not within the remake of this  
[1:41:37](https://youtu.be/iyWFulQ7apg?t=6097) podcast where with this live stream  
[1:41:40](https://youtu.be/iyWFulQ7apg?t=6100) we're speaking about doubts about islam  
[1:41:42](https://youtu.be/iyWFulQ7apg?t=6102) and if anybody has a question but  
[1:41:44](https://youtu.be/iyWFulQ7apg?t=6104) about mudhubs a general islamic question  
[1:41:46](https://youtu.be/iyWFulQ7apg?t=6106) is not something we answer  
[1:41:49](https://youtu.be/iyWFulQ7apg?t=6109) okay so can i ask another question  
[1:41:51](https://youtu.be/iyWFulQ7apg?t=6111) instead of it  
[1:41:53](https://youtu.be/iyWFulQ7apg?t=6113) yeah at that point you can ask another  
[1:41:54](https://youtu.be/iyWFulQ7apg?t=6114) question  
[1:41:58](https://youtu.be/iyWFulQ7apg?t=6118) yeah my second question was how to what  
[1:42:01](https://youtu.be/iyWFulQ7apg?t=6121) extent  
[1:42:01](https://youtu.be/iyWFulQ7apg?t=6121) a normal muslim who is not  
[1:42:04](https://youtu.be/iyWFulQ7apg?t=6124) a full-time daughter who has not done  
[1:42:09](https://youtu.be/iyWFulQ7apg?t=6129) his time to learn the competitive  
[1:42:11](https://youtu.be/iyWFulQ7apg?t=6131) religion to engage with  
[1:42:13](https://youtu.be/iyWFulQ7apg?t=6133) non-muslims especially living in us  
[1:42:16](https://youtu.be/iyWFulQ7apg?t=6136) to what extent we should engage with  
[1:42:20](https://youtu.be/iyWFulQ7apg?t=6140) christians especially because that's the  
[1:42:22](https://youtu.be/iyWFulQ7apg?t=6142) bigger population  
[1:42:24](https://youtu.be/iyWFulQ7apg?t=6144) where we actually do the more damage  
[1:42:27](https://youtu.be/iyWFulQ7apg?t=6147) then actually put forward the right  
[1:42:32](https://youtu.be/iyWFulQ7apg?t=6152) islam in front of them but when you talk  
[1:42:34](https://youtu.be/iyWFulQ7apg?t=6154) to co-workers  
[1:42:36](https://youtu.be/iyWFulQ7apg?t=6156) yeah so brother i i would i would answer  
[1:42:38](https://youtu.be/iyWFulQ7apg?t=6158) this question quite briefly because it's  
[1:42:40](https://youtu.be/iyWFulQ7apg?t=6160) a very common question the first thing  
[1:42:42](https://youtu.be/iyWFulQ7apg?t=6162) is that you should obviously gain  
[1:42:44](https://youtu.be/iyWFulQ7apg?t=6164) knowledge  
[1:42:44](https://youtu.be/iyWFulQ7apg?t=6164) and it's not the case that um we don't  
[1:42:48](https://youtu.be/iyWFulQ7apg?t=6168) have enough time for it  
[1:42:49](https://youtu.be/iyWFulQ7apg?t=6169) or we can't and everybody's capable of  
[1:42:52](https://youtu.be/iyWFulQ7apg?t=6172) it and if anything's important then you  
[1:42:53](https://youtu.be/iyWFulQ7apg?t=6173) get it done  
[1:42:54](https://youtu.be/iyWFulQ7apg?t=6174) the other thing is that the prophet  
[1:42:56](https://youtu.be/iyWFulQ7apg?t=6176) sallam said convey from me even if it's  
[1:42:58](https://youtu.be/iyWFulQ7apg?t=6178) one verse  
[1:42:58](https://youtu.be/iyWFulQ7apg?t=6178) so you may not need to get into a deep  
[1:43:01](https://youtu.be/iyWFulQ7apg?t=6181) theological discussion  
[1:43:02](https://youtu.be/iyWFulQ7apg?t=6182) with a christian about the trinity but  
[1:43:04](https://youtu.be/iyWFulQ7apg?t=6184) at least you can share with them  
[1:43:06](https://youtu.be/iyWFulQ7apg?t=6186) a few quranic verses give them a free  
[1:43:09](https://youtu.be/iyWFulQ7apg?t=6189) free  
[1:43:09](https://youtu.be/iyWFulQ7apg?t=6189) booklets pamphlets whatever it is every  
[1:43:12](https://youtu.be/iyWFulQ7apg?t=6192) muslim has a duty upon them  
[1:43:14](https://youtu.be/iyWFulQ7apg?t=6194) to uh when they get the opportunity that  
[1:43:18](https://youtu.be/iyWFulQ7apg?t=6198) if people want to know about islam that  
[1:43:19](https://youtu.be/iyWFulQ7apg?t=6199) they should speak to them and even if  
[1:43:20](https://youtu.be/iyWFulQ7apg?t=6200) they don't want to know about islam they  
[1:43:22](https://youtu.be/iyWFulQ7apg?t=6202) should try to create that um  
[1:43:24](https://youtu.be/iyWFulQ7apg?t=6204) thing uh that atmosphere and i would say  
[1:43:27](https://youtu.be/iyWFulQ7apg?t=6207) uh don't worry too much about you know  
[1:43:30](https://youtu.be/iyWFulQ7apg?t=6210) um  
[1:43:31](https://youtu.be/iyWFulQ7apg?t=6211) i need to have an extraordinary level of  
[1:43:33](https://youtu.be/iyWFulQ7apg?t=6213) knowledge to actually give dawa aira  
[1:43:36](https://youtu.be/iyWFulQ7apg?t=6216) um actually has a very good basic tower  
[1:43:38](https://youtu.be/iyWFulQ7apg?t=6218) training course that you can attend  
[1:43:40](https://youtu.be/iyWFulQ7apg?t=6220) um and we've just updated it um and once

[1:44:55](https://youtu.be/iyWFulQ7apg?t=6295) question  
[1:44:55](https://youtu.be/iyWFulQ7apg?t=6295) but just getting to my question so  
[1:44:58](https://youtu.be/iyWFulQ7apg?t=6298) uh jazakallah for taking the time uh to  
[1:45:01](https://youtu.be/iyWFulQ7apg?t=6301) answer  
[1:45:02](https://youtu.be/iyWFulQ7apg?t=6302) um just going back to the comments you  
[1:45:04](https://youtu.be/iyWFulQ7apg?t=6304) had about the scientific miracle i mean  
[1:45:05](https://youtu.be/iyWFulQ7apg?t=6305) just like yourself  
[1:45:06](https://youtu.be/iyWFulQ7apg?t=6306) i grew up you know watching dr zakir  
[1:45:08](https://youtu.be/iyWFulQ7apg?t=6308) naik and um  
[1:45:09](https://youtu.be/iyWFulQ7apg?t=6309) you know reading the books you know and  
[1:45:11](https://youtu.be/iyWFulQ7apg?t=6311) i and  
[1:45:12](https://youtu.be/iyWFulQ7apg?t=6312) recently you know i came across  
[1:45:18](https://youtu.be/iyWFulQ7apg?t=6318) and everyone else's and you know it's  
[1:45:20](https://youtu.be/iyWFulQ7apg?t=6320) convinced me otherwise that we shouldn't  
[1:45:21](https://youtu.be/iyWFulQ7apg?t=6321) be looking for conviction through  
[1:45:23](https://youtu.be/iyWFulQ7apg?t=6323) scientific miracles of the quran but the  
[1:45:25](https://youtu.be/iyWFulQ7apg?t=6325) underlying principle is that  
[1:45:27](https://youtu.be/iyWFulQ7apg?t=6327) we as muslims are looking for that  
[1:45:28](https://youtu.be/iyWFulQ7apg?t=6328) conviction right so  
[1:45:30](https://youtu.be/iyWFulQ7apg?t=6330) because we uh subhanallah we have a lot  
[1:45:32](https://youtu.be/iyWFulQ7apg?t=6332) of profound things that we believe in  
[1:45:34](https://youtu.be/iyWFulQ7apg?t=6334) like you know the miracle birth of adam  
[1:45:36](https://youtu.be/iyWFulQ7apg?t=6336) salaam isaac  
[1:45:38](https://youtu.be/iyWFulQ7apg?t=6338) and all the things that brothers have  
[1:45:39](https://youtu.be/iyWFulQ7apg?t=6339) brought up today so when people  
[1:45:42](https://youtu.be/iyWFulQ7apg?t=6342) the conviction in all of that is rooted  
[1:45:45](https://youtu.be/iyWFulQ7apg?t=6345) in  
[1:45:46](https://youtu.be/iyWFulQ7apg?t=6346) what people say the quran the miraculous  
[1:45:48](https://youtu.be/iyWFulQ7apg?t=6348) nature of the quran  
[1:45:49](https://youtu.be/iyWFulQ7apg?t=6349) so what i just kind of what i've been  
[1:45:51](https://youtu.be/iyWFulQ7apg?t=6351) trying to do for the last little while  
[1:45:53](https://youtu.be/iyWFulQ7apg?t=6353) and you know i've been browsing sapience  
[1:45:54](https://youtu.be/iyWFulQ7apg?t=6354) institute and all these other videos  
[1:45:56](https://youtu.be/iyWFulQ7apg?t=6356) is um i am absolutely convinced of the  
[1:45:59](https://youtu.be/iyWFulQ7apg?t=6359) quran but how do we  
[1:46:00](https://youtu.be/iyWFulQ7apg?t=6360) further build on that conviction like  
[1:46:02](https://youtu.be/iyWFulQ7apg?t=6362) what is it that we must do to go like  
[1:46:04](https://youtu.be/iyWFulQ7apg?t=6364) this this book this upon this miracle  
[1:46:07](https://youtu.be/iyWFulQ7apg?t=6367) that we have is  
[1:46:08](https://youtu.be/iyWFulQ7apg?t=6368) no doubt the miracle and i know it's a  
[1:46:10](https://youtu.be/iyWFulQ7apg?t=6370) weird complicated question but i just  
[1:46:11](https://youtu.be/iyWFulQ7apg?t=6371) wanted to understand what one could do  
[1:46:14](https://youtu.be/iyWFulQ7apg?t=6374) i mean there's probably the intellectual  
[1:46:15](https://youtu.be/iyWFulQ7apg?t=6375) arguments we've got a book called the  
[1:46:17](https://youtu.be/iyWFulQ7apg?t=6377) eternal challenge  
[1:46:18](https://youtu.be/iyWFulQ7apg?t=6378) and that summarizes the arguments quite  
[1:46:20](https://youtu.be/iyWFulQ7apg?t=6380) well um  
[1:46:22](https://youtu.be/iyWFulQ7apg?t=6382) but i would say it's not just about  
[1:46:25](https://youtu.be/iyWFulQ7apg?t=6385) the intellectual stuff that definitely  
[1:46:28](https://youtu.be/iyWFulQ7apg?t=6388) that will take you to  
[1:46:29](https://youtu.be/iyWFulQ7apg?t=6389) uh the point that you know islam is true  
[1:46:32](https://youtu.be/iyWFulQ7apg?t=6392) but it will not take you to the point of  
[1:46:35](https://youtu.be/iyWFulQ7apg?t=6395) making islam  
[1:46:37](https://youtu.be/iyWFulQ7apg?t=6397) the absolute proof in your life and  
[1:46:40](https://youtu.be/iyWFulQ7apg?t=6400) and you want to live i mean something  
[1:46:42](https://youtu.be/iyWFulQ7apg?t=6402) can be true but it doesn't change you it  
[1:46:43](https://youtu.be/iyWFulQ7apg?t=6403) doesn't impact you it doesn't  
[1:46:46](https://youtu.be/iyWFulQ7apg?t=6406) change your very dna and that is simply  
[1:46:49](https://youtu.be/iyWFulQ7apg?t=6409) the worship of allah  
[1:46:50](https://youtu.be/iyWFulQ7apg?t=6410) which does that so acting upon islam  
[1:46:52](https://youtu.be/iyWFulQ7apg?t=6412) living islam  
[1:46:54](https://youtu.be/iyWFulQ7apg?t=6414) in fact some people skip their  
[1:46:55](https://youtu.be/iyWFulQ7apg?t=6415) intellectual journey entirely  
[1:46:57](https://youtu.be/iyWFulQ7apg?t=6417) and just try to worship a lot when they  
[1:47:01](https://youtu.be/iyWFulQ7apg?t=6421) reach  
[1:47:02](https://youtu.be/iyWFulQ7apg?t=6422) the same level that somebody that first  
[1:47:04](https://youtu.be/iyWFulQ7apg?t=6424) uses the intellect  
[1:47:05](https://youtu.be/iyWFulQ7apg?t=6425) and then submits to allah yeah  
[1:47:09](https://youtu.be/iyWFulQ7apg?t=6429) it just i just if i just refer uh  
[1:47:13](https://youtu.be/iyWFulQ7apg?t=6433) brother or um to job um so like i  
[1:47:16](https://youtu.be/iyWFulQ7apg?t=6436) watched one of your podcasts where you  
[1:47:17](https://youtu.be/iyWFulQ7apg?t=6437) said that um  
[1:47:19](https://youtu.be/iyWFulQ7apg?t=6439) you know you went on his journey to go  
[1:47:21](https://youtu.be/iyWFulQ7apg?t=6441) and study the quran and  
[1:47:23](https://youtu.be/iyWFulQ7apg?t=6443) learn the quran and then you said you  
[1:47:25](https://youtu.be/iyWFulQ7apg?t=6445) were absolutely confused you said if  
[1:47:26](https://youtu.be/iyWFulQ7apg?t=6446) anyone gives you the quran you would  
[1:47:27](https://youtu.be/iyWFulQ7apg?t=6447) have believed  
[1:47:28](https://youtu.be/iyWFulQ7apg?t=6448) that person just because of how you  
[1:47:30](https://youtu.be/iyWFulQ7apg?t=6450) convinced you of the quran  
[1:47:31](https://youtu.be/iyWFulQ7apg?t=6451) so i mean everyone's journey could be  
[1:47:34](https://youtu.be/iyWFulQ7apg?t=6454) different but i just wanted to  
[1:47:35](https://youtu.be/iyWFulQ7apg?t=6455) understand  
[1:47:35](https://youtu.be/iyWFulQ7apg?t=6455) just advice with brothers in general  
[1:47:37](https://youtu.be/iyWFulQ7apg?t=6457) what could they do to  
[1:47:38](https://youtu.be/iyWFulQ7apg?t=6458) increase that conviction of the quran  
[1:47:40](https://youtu.be/iyWFulQ7apg?t=6460) inshallah yeah i think you know  
[1:47:42](https://youtu.be/iyWFulQ7apg?t=6462) you start off with talking about the  
[1:47:43](https://youtu.be/iyWFulQ7apg?t=6463) scientific stuff we don't we don't  
[1:47:45](https://youtu.be/iyWFulQ7apg?t=6465) negate the fact that los pantara speaks  
[1:47:47](https://youtu.be/iyWFulQ7apg?t=6467) about  
[1:47:48](https://youtu.be/iyWFulQ7apg?t=6468) naturalistic phenomena and we believe  
[1:47:50](https://youtu.be/iyWFulQ7apg?t=6470) that our last parent has put in a way  
[1:47:52](https://youtu.be/iyWFulQ7apg?t=6472) which will be con  
[1:47:53](https://youtu.be/iyWFulQ7apg?t=6473) like facilitative for seventh century  
[1:47:56](https://youtu.be/iyWFulQ7apg?t=6476) audiences all the way up to 21st century  
[1:47:57](https://youtu.be/iyWFulQ7apg?t=6477) audiences  
[1:47:59](https://youtu.be/iyWFulQ7apg?t=6479) uh and that that in itself is them if  
[1:48:01](https://youtu.be/iyWFulQ7apg?t=6481) there's going to be anything  
[1:48:02](https://youtu.be/iyWFulQ7apg?t=6482) that relates to naturalistic phenomena  
[1:48:04](https://youtu.be/iyWFulQ7apg?t=6484) that we want to call the miracle  
[1:48:06](https://youtu.be/iyWFulQ7apg?t=6486) it's that situation is that propensity  
[1:48:08](https://youtu.be/iyWFulQ7apg?t=6488) to facilitate for all those generations  
[1:48:10](https://youtu.be/iyWFulQ7apg?t=6490) in between  
[1:48:11](https://youtu.be/iyWFulQ7apg?t=6491) right and and in the future so that's  
[1:48:14](https://youtu.be/iyWFulQ7apg?t=6494) the first thing the sec  
[1:48:15](https://youtu.be/iyWFulQ7apg?t=6495) the second thing is and by the way with  
[1:48:17](https://youtu.be/iyWFulQ7apg?t=6497) this  
[1:48:18](https://youtu.be/iyWFulQ7apg?t=6498) i believe that islam as an ancient  
[1:48:20](https://youtu.be/iyWFulQ7apg?t=6500) religion is unique in this  
[1:48:22](https://youtu.be/iyWFulQ7apg?t=6502) because you know if you look at the  
[1:48:24](https://youtu.be/iyWFulQ7apg?t=6504) midrash which is the ancient  
[1:48:26](https://youtu.be/iyWFulQ7apg?t=6506) uh jewish commentaries of the old  
[1:48:28](https://youtu.be/iyWFulQ7apg?t=6508) testament for example  
[1:48:29](https://youtu.be/iyWFulQ7apg?t=6509) and even if you look at patristic exeter  
[1:48:31](https://youtu.be/iyWFulQ7apg?t=6511) jesus is of the of the new testament and  
[1:48:33](https://youtu.be/iyWFulQ7apg?t=6513) the old testament because some of the  
[1:48:35](https://youtu.be/iyWFulQ7apg?t=6515) church fathers and ecclesiastic writers  
[1:48:38](https://youtu.be/iyWFulQ7apg?t=6518) like  
[1:48:39](https://youtu.be/iyWFulQ7apg?t=6519) origin of alexandria and uh others they  
[1:48:42](https://youtu.be/iyWFulQ7apg?t=6522) they actually wrote like  
[1:48:43](https://youtu.be/iyWFulQ7apg?t=6523) uh augustine like um an exegesis one  
[1:48:47](https://youtu.be/iyWFulQ7apg?t=6527) on genesis uh many of them did right  
[1:48:50](https://youtu.be/iyWFulQ7apg?t=6530) and if you look at what they how they  
[1:48:52](https://youtu.be/iyWFulQ7apg?t=6532) interact with both them and the old  
[1:48:54](https://youtu.be/iyWFulQ7apg?t=6534) testament there's  
[1:48:55](https://youtu.be/iyWFulQ7apg?t=6535) basically no interpretation just to take  
[1:48:57](https://youtu.be/iyWFulQ7apg?t=6537) one example like  
[1:48:59](https://youtu.be/iyWFulQ7apg?t=6539) the flatness of the earth that was  
[1:49:00](https://youtu.be/iyWFulQ7apg?t=6540) consensus i mean  
[1:49:02](https://youtu.be/iyWFulQ7apg?t=6542) the real fraternity of the earth only  
[1:49:04](https://youtu.be/iyWFulQ7apg?t=6544) came about maybe from augustine's time  
[1:49:06](https://youtu.be/iyWFulQ7apg?t=6546) onward  
[1:49:07](https://youtu.be/iyWFulQ7apg?t=6547) because of aristotelian logic for  
[1:49:09](https://youtu.be/iyWFulQ7apg?t=6549) instance yeah and because of  
[1:49:10](https://youtu.be/iyWFulQ7apg?t=6550) aristotelian or greek influence it  
[1:49:12](https://youtu.be/iyWFulQ7apg?t=6552) wasn't  
[1:49:13](https://youtu.be/iyWFulQ7apg?t=6553) that anybody ever looked at any verse in  
[1:49:16](https://youtu.be/iyWFulQ7apg?t=6556) the quran  
[1:49:16](https://youtu.be/iyWFulQ7apg?t=6556) in the bible and said that that verse  
[1:49:18](https://youtu.be/iyWFulQ7apg?t=6558) indicates that the earth is wrong i  
[1:49:19](https://youtu.be/iyWFulQ7apg?t=6559) don't think there's anything like that  
[1:49:22](https://youtu.be/iyWFulQ7apg?t=6562) they believe it's round because of the  
[1:49:24](https://youtu.be/iyWFulQ7apg?t=6564) greek influence  
[1:49:26](https://youtu.be/iyWFulQ7apg?t=6566) so that's one thing we've had we have  
[1:49:27](https://youtu.be/iyWFulQ7apg?t=6567) precedent now when we say that  
[1:49:29](https://youtu.be/iyWFulQ7apg?t=6569) for example the cosmology that we  
[1:49:31](https://youtu.be/iyWFulQ7apg?t=6571) believe in today is a cosmopolitan  
[1:49:33](https://youtu.be/iyWFulQ7apg?t=6573) which is concurrent uh we have president  
[1:49:37](https://youtu.be/iyWFulQ7apg?t=6577) going all the way back to the salaf that  
[1:49:39](https://youtu.be/iyWFulQ7apg?t=6579) people saying  
[1:49:40](https://youtu.be/iyWFulQ7apg?t=6580) you know xyz about the the universe or  
[1:49:43](https://youtu.be/iyWFulQ7apg?t=6583) the earth or whatever it may be which  
[1:49:45](https://youtu.be/iyWFulQ7apg?t=6585) will be concurrent  
[1:49:46](https://youtu.be/iyWFulQ7apg?t=6586) with 21st century cosmological  
[1:49:47](https://youtu.be/iyWFulQ7apg?t=6587) understandings that is not afforded  
[1:49:50](https://youtu.be/iyWFulQ7apg?t=6590) yeah to other ancient texts so i think  
[1:49:53](https://youtu.be/iyWFulQ7apg?t=6593) that in itself is already a defining  
[1:49:55](https://youtu.be/iyWFulQ7apg?t=6595) thing so  
[1:49:56](https://youtu.be/iyWFulQ7apg?t=6596) we don't throw the baby out with a  
[1:49:58](https://youtu.be/iyWFulQ7apg?t=6598) pathway i think when it comes to  
[1:49:59](https://youtu.be/iyWFulQ7apg?t=6599) naturalistic stuff  
[1:50:00](https://youtu.be/iyWFulQ7apg?t=6600) and what with the scientific miracles  
[1:50:02](https://youtu.be/iyWFulQ7apg?t=6602) thing we just believe that the argument  
[1:50:04](https://youtu.be/iyWFulQ7apg?t=6604) has been framed incorrectly  
[1:50:05](https://youtu.be/iyWFulQ7apg?t=6605) yeah it couldn't have been known at the  
[1:50:07](https://youtu.be/iyWFulQ7apg?t=6607) time with this or that this these  
[1:50:08](https://youtu.be/iyWFulQ7apg?t=6608) phrases  
[1:50:09](https://youtu.be/iyWFulQ7apg?t=6609) have gotten us in trouble for the last  
[1:50:10](https://youtu.be/iyWFulQ7apg?t=6610) 20 years because they are not  
[1:50:12](https://youtu.be/iyWFulQ7apg?t=6612) sophisticated from an academic  
[1:50:14](https://youtu.be/iyWFulQ7apg?t=6614) perspective um  
[1:50:16](https://youtu.be/iyWFulQ7apg?t=6616) right so that's number one number two in  
[1:50:18](https://youtu.be/iyWFulQ7apg?t=6618) terms of for me anyways personally like  
[1:50:20](https://youtu.be/iyWFulQ7apg?t=6620) when i started to memorize the quran and  
[1:50:21](https://youtu.be/iyWFulQ7apg?t=6621) read it and stuff i just started to  
[1:50:23](https://youtu.be/iyWFulQ7apg?t=6623) i know it sounds a bit weird but i  
[1:50:24](https://youtu.be/iyWFulQ7apg?t=6624) started number one  
[1:50:26](https://youtu.be/iyWFulQ7apg?t=6626) i started to listen into the flow of it  
[1:50:28](https://youtu.be/iyWFulQ7apg?t=6628) and stuff and when i compared it with  
[1:50:30](https://youtu.be/iyWFulQ7apg?t=6630) what i knew of arabic poetry and and  
[1:50:33](https://youtu.be/iyWFulQ7apg?t=6633) stuff like that another arabic speech  
[1:50:35](https://youtu.be/iyWFulQ7apg?t=6635) i just i don't sound ridiculous but  
[1:50:38](https://youtu.be/iyWFulQ7apg?t=6638) it was something like it was an  
[1:50:39](https://youtu.be/iyWFulQ7apg?t=6639) intuition that i knew this was  
[1:50:40](https://youtu.be/iyWFulQ7apg?t=6640) completely different but it was about  
[1:50:43](https://youtu.be/iyWFulQ7apg?t=6643) how do i measure that now quantitative  
[1:50:46](https://youtu.be/iyWFulQ7apg?t=6646) how do i put that into it so i started  
[1:50:48](https://youtu.be/iyWFulQ7apg?t=6648) reading books of  
[1:50:48](https://youtu.be/iyWFulQ7apg?t=6648) jazz and delaila and stuff like that in  
[1:50:50](https://youtu.be/iyWFulQ7apg?t=6650) arabic which is plenty  
[1:50:52](https://youtu.be/iyWFulQ7apg?t=6652) like the structures and now a lot of it  
[1:50:54](https://youtu.be/iyWFulQ7apg?t=6654) has been translated into english like  
[1:50:55](https://youtu.be/iyWFulQ7apg?t=6655) raymond farron with the structures  
[1:50:57](https://youtu.be/iyWFulQ7apg?t=6657) of scientific cohesion in arabic there's  
[1:50:59](https://youtu.be/iyWFulQ7apg?t=6659) one called uh  
[1:51:01](https://youtu.be/iyWFulQ7apg?t=6661) quran by sultan and stuff like that and  
[1:51:03](https://youtu.be/iyWFulQ7apg?t=6663) he's talking about how the quran is all  
[1:51:05](https://youtu.be/iyWFulQ7apg?t=6665) interlaced and perfectly like structured  
[1:51:07](https://youtu.be/iyWFulQ7apg?t=6667) and stuff despite  
[1:51:08](https://youtu.be/iyWFulQ7apg?t=6668) being piecemeal uh revelations like the  
[1:51:11](https://youtu.be/iyWFulQ7apg?t=6671) fact like for example i remember when i  
[1:51:13](https://youtu.be/iyWFulQ7apg?t=6673) back in the days i was i was memorizing  
[1:51:16](https://youtu.be/iyWFulQ7apg?t=6676) and i was i was just fighting and i  
[1:51:19](https://youtu.be/iyWFulQ7apg?t=6679) realized well every single a has the  
[1:51:20](https://youtu.be/iyWFulQ7apg?t=6680) word allah in it  
[1:51:22](https://youtu.be/iyWFulQ7apg?t=6682) and i was i found that as a revelation i  
[1:51:24](https://youtu.be/iyWFulQ7apg?t=6684) i looked at it myself and i thought this  
[1:51:26](https://youtu.be/iyWFulQ7apg?t=6686) is  
[1:51:26](https://youtu.be/iyWFulQ7apg?t=6686) unbelievable because in the middle of  
[1:51:28](https://youtu.be/iyWFulQ7apg?t=6688) that surah i was like  
[1:51:34](https://youtu.be/iyWFulQ7apg?t=6694) he surrounded them and he made them  
[1:51:36](https://youtu.be/iyWFulQ7apg?t=6696) forget the  
[1:51:37](https://youtu.be/iyWFulQ7apg?t=6697) mention of allah and it's not allah is  
[1:51:39](https://youtu.be/iyWFulQ7apg?t=6699) trying to get us to remember  
[1:51:41](https://youtu.be/iyWFulQ7apg?t=6701) do you know what i'm trying to say  
[1:51:42](https://youtu.be/iyWFulQ7apg?t=6702) because the shaytan is trying to get us  
[1:51:43](https://youtu.be/iyWFulQ7apg?t=6703) to forget and i'm thinking wow man  
[1:51:45](https://youtu.be/iyWFulQ7apg?t=6705) like this is a tourist speech and in  
[1:51:48](https://youtu.be/iyWFulQ7apg?t=6708) every single area because it was only  
[1:51:49](https://youtu.be/iyWFulQ7apg?t=6709) like maybe i don't know 40 years in that  
[1:51:51](https://youtu.be/iyWFulQ7apg?t=6711) surah  
[1:51:52](https://youtu.be/iyWFulQ7apg?t=6712) right every single as it's got the word  
[1:51:54](https://youtu.be/iyWFulQ7apg?t=6714) align and like how can you  
[1:51:55](https://youtu.be/iyWFulQ7apg?t=6715) program that into your oral  
[1:51:57](https://youtu.be/iyWFulQ7apg?t=6717) communication if you want  
[1:51:59](https://youtu.be/iyWFulQ7apg?t=6719) you're making all these arguments and  
[1:52:00](https://youtu.be/iyWFulQ7apg?t=6720) you're shifting from one subject to the  
[1:52:02](https://youtu.be/iyWFulQ7apg?t=6722) other and  
[1:52:03](https://youtu.be/iyWFulQ7apg?t=6723) and you're putting the word allah is  
[1:52:05](https://youtu.be/iyWFulQ7apg?t=6725) very very very difficult to do  
[1:52:07](https://youtu.be/iyWFulQ7apg?t=6727) and i realized these subtleties existed  
[1:52:10](https://youtu.be/iyWFulQ7apg?t=6730) jani  
[1:52:10](https://youtu.be/iyWFulQ7apg?t=6730) throughout the quran so then it was a  
[1:52:12](https://youtu.be/iyWFulQ7apg?t=6732) matter of trying to  
[1:52:14](https://youtu.be/iyWFulQ7apg?t=6734) to see who spoke about this in similar  
[1:52:16](https://youtu.be/iyWFulQ7apg?t=6736) terms  
[1:52:17](https://youtu.be/iyWFulQ7apg?t=6737) and i realized there was a rich  
[1:52:18](https://youtu.be/iyWFulQ7apg?t=6738) literature from all the way back  
[1:52:20](https://youtu.be/iyWFulQ7apg?t=6740) you know um from the festival like  
[1:52:23](https://youtu.be/iyWFulQ7apg?t=6743) in history he starts talking about this  
[1:52:25](https://youtu.be/iyWFulQ7apg?t=6745) as zamasu and his  
[1:52:26](https://youtu.be/iyWFulQ7apg?t=6746) kashaf he talks about this and  
[1:52:28](https://youtu.be/iyWFulQ7apg?t=6748) everyone's talking about this it's  
[1:52:30](https://youtu.be/iyWFulQ7apg?t=6750) like like live discussion about how this  
[1:52:33](https://youtu.be/iyWFulQ7apg?t=6753) the quran is the more jesus is how it's  
[1:52:35](https://youtu.be/iyWFulQ7apg?t=6755) uh  
[1:52:36](https://youtu.be/iyWFulQ7apg?t=6756) it's a miracle and i thought that  
[1:52:38](https://youtu.be/iyWFulQ7apg?t=6758) basically intellectually it's very very  
[1:52:39](https://youtu.be/iyWFulQ7apg?t=6759) satisfying for me anyway  
[1:52:41](https://youtu.be/iyWFulQ7apg?t=6761) oh josiah uh if i could just give one  
[1:52:43](https://youtu.be/iyWFulQ7apg?t=6763) quick feedback  
[1:52:44](https://youtu.be/iyWFulQ7apg?t=6764) um your savings institute videos the  
[1:52:46](https://youtu.be/iyWFulQ7apg?t=6766) ones you put out marshall they're great  
[1:52:48](https://youtu.be/iyWFulQ7apg?t=6768) i love them  
[1:52:49](https://youtu.be/iyWFulQ7apg?t=6769) but i have to listen to them on 0.5 0.75  
[1:52:52](https://youtu.be/iyWFulQ7apg?t=6772) speed because why shall you speak so  
[1:52:53](https://youtu.be/iyWFulQ7apg?t=6773) fast  
[1:52:56](https://youtu.be/iyWFulQ7apg?t=6776) if  
[1:53:01](https://youtu.be/iyWFulQ7apg?t=6781) yeah just for the benefit of everyone  
[1:53:03](https://youtu.be/iyWFulQ7apg?t=6783) watching and and if you could throw  
[1:53:04](https://youtu.be/iyWFulQ7apg?t=6784) sometimes some  
[1:53:05](https://youtu.be/iyWFulQ7apg?t=6785) visuals up on the screen just so it's  
[1:53:07](https://youtu.be/iyWFulQ7apg?t=6787) easy to follow the brothers because i  
[1:53:09](https://youtu.be/iyWFulQ7apg?t=6789) have to watch it multiple times and i've  
[1:53:10](https://youtu.be/iyWFulQ7apg?t=6790) read the comments to say the same thing  
[1:53:13](https://youtu.be/iyWFulQ7apg?t=6793) for your time you know um if i'll do  
[1:53:16](https://youtu.be/iyWFulQ7apg?t=6796) that  
[1:53:16](https://youtu.be/iyWFulQ7apg?t=6796) if that if you find that tough here i  
[1:53:18](https://youtu.be/iyWFulQ7apg?t=6798) tried reading hijab's book on feminism  
[1:53:21](https://youtu.be/iyWFulQ7apg?t=6801) and i had this hubris  
[1:53:25](https://youtu.be/iyWFulQ7apg?t=6805) i'll be able to understand this i looked  
[1:53:28](https://youtu.be/iyWFulQ7apg?t=6808) at it and he looked at me  
[1:53:29](https://youtu.be/iyWFulQ7apg?t=6809) and i was like yeah it's not wrong  
[1:53:34](https://youtu.be/iyWFulQ7apg?t=6814) i read a couple of your essays on  
[1:53:35](https://youtu.be/iyWFulQ7apg?t=6815) darwinian evolution  
[1:53:38](https://youtu.be/iyWFulQ7apg?t=6818) i was just watching uh brother sevier's

[1:54:16](https://youtu.be/iyWFulQ7apg?t=6856) against deism uh

[1:54:46](https://youtu.be/iyWFulQ7apg?t=6886) and when i read it it was honestly the  
[1:54:49](https://youtu.be/iyWFulQ7apg?t=6889) best thing i have  
[1:54:50](https://youtu.be/iyWFulQ7apg?t=6890) ever seen i'm not even talking about  
[1:54:52](https://youtu.be/iyWFulQ7apg?t=6892) from a muslim really  
[1:54:53](https://youtu.be/iyWFulQ7apg?t=6893) even from like a christian or whatever  
[1:54:56](https://youtu.be/iyWFulQ7apg?t=6896) it's just something he's published on  
[1:54:59](https://youtu.be/iyWFulQ7apg?t=6899) academia.edu  
[1:55:00](https://youtu.be/iyWFulQ7apg?t=6900) i think it's the only thing that i've  
[1:55:02](https://youtu.be/iyWFulQ7apg?t=6902) read of his but  
[1:55:04](https://youtu.be/iyWFulQ7apg?t=6904) i mean that was the best reputation  
[1:55:07](https://youtu.be/iyWFulQ7apg?t=6907) okay so yeah i'll give you an argument  
[1:55:09](https://youtu.be/iyWFulQ7apg?t=6909) the argument that he was like  
[1:55:11](https://youtu.be/iyWFulQ7apg?t=6911) what we do in our goal rap is we speak  
[1:55:14](https://youtu.be/iyWFulQ7apg?t=6914) about how it's basically part of allah's  
[1:55:16](https://youtu.be/iyWFulQ7apg?t=6916) wisdom  
[1:55:17](https://youtu.be/iyWFulQ7apg?t=6917) that allah speaks to us and and he just  
[1:55:20](https://youtu.be/iyWFulQ7apg?t=6920) bassam just really puts that in an  
[1:55:22](https://youtu.be/iyWFulQ7apg?t=6922) academic way i'll say for the purposes  
[1:55:24](https://youtu.be/iyWFulQ7apg?t=6924) of the questioner  
[1:55:25](https://youtu.be/iyWFulQ7apg?t=6925) it's sufficient that the idea that allah  
[1:55:28](https://youtu.be/iyWFulQ7apg?t=6928) created everything and just left it to  
[1:55:31](https://youtu.be/iyWFulQ7apg?t=6931) run by itself  
[1:55:33](https://youtu.be/iyWFulQ7apg?t=6933) would basically mean allah is doing  
[1:55:34](https://youtu.be/iyWFulQ7apg?t=6934) something superfluous that there's no  
[1:55:36](https://youtu.be/iyWFulQ7apg?t=6936) meaning there's no  
[1:55:37](https://youtu.be/iyWFulQ7apg?t=6937) foresight there's no end goal and that's  
[1:55:40](https://youtu.be/iyWFulQ7apg?t=6940) obviously not part of perfection power  
[1:55:42](https://youtu.be/iyWFulQ7apg?t=6942) perfection would be  
[1:55:43](https://youtu.be/iyWFulQ7apg?t=6943) that you would you know do things for a  
[1:55:46](https://youtu.be/iyWFulQ7apg?t=6946) for a reason you wouldn't just you know  
[1:55:49](https://youtu.be/iyWFulQ7apg?t=6949) just um just do stuff  
[1:55:51](https://youtu.be/iyWFulQ7apg?t=6951) without um without any  
[1:55:54](https://youtu.be/iyWFulQ7apg?t=6954) um justification at all so that's what  
[1:55:57](https://youtu.be/iyWFulQ7apg?t=6957) we need to keep in mind when it comes to  
[1:55:59](https://youtu.be/iyWFulQ7apg?t=6959) deism  
[1:56:00](https://youtu.be/iyWFulQ7apg?t=6960) deism i believe is uh  
[1:56:03](https://youtu.be/iyWFulQ7apg?t=6963) actually quite popular it's a lot more  
[1:56:05](https://youtu.be/iyWFulQ7apg?t=6965) popular  
[1:56:06](https://youtu.be/iyWFulQ7apg?t=6966) than i think atheism i think atheists  
[1:56:08](https://youtu.be/iyWFulQ7apg?t=6968) are loud dias are not allowed but i  
[1:56:10](https://youtu.be/iyWFulQ7apg?t=6970) think there are  
[1:56:11](https://youtu.be/iyWFulQ7apg?t=6971) actually a lot of dias out there um  
[1:56:14](https://youtu.be/iyWFulQ7apg?t=6974) how do you address deism um  
[1:56:17](https://youtu.be/iyWFulQ7apg?t=6977) yeah i think what you said is right i  
[1:56:19](https://youtu.be/iyWFulQ7apg?t=6979) mean i think what you said is right  
[1:56:21](https://youtu.be/iyWFulQ7apg?t=6981) and obviously there's so many verses in  
[1:56:23](https://youtu.be/iyWFulQ7apg?t=6983) the quran that actually attack  
[1:56:25](https://youtu.be/iyWFulQ7apg?t=6985) deism um that allah has not  
[1:56:28](https://youtu.be/iyWFulQ7apg?t=6988) created this heaven and earth for play  
[1:56:30](https://youtu.be/iyWFulQ7apg?t=6990) and  
[1:56:31](https://youtu.be/iyWFulQ7apg?t=6991) amusement and if he wanted to he would  
[1:56:33](https://youtu.be/iyWFulQ7apg?t=6993) have taken  
[1:56:34](https://youtu.be/iyWFulQ7apg?t=6994) from him himself uh something to do for  
[1:56:38](https://youtu.be/iyWFulQ7apg?t=6998) idle time and so on  
[1:56:39](https://youtu.be/iyWFulQ7apg?t=6999) so these actually they've i always  
[1:56:42](https://youtu.be/iyWFulQ7apg?t=7002) believe that the verses of the quran are  
[1:56:43](https://youtu.be/iyWFulQ7apg?t=7003) the best  
[1:56:45](https://youtu.be/iyWFulQ7apg?t=7005) because when allah says that he created  
[1:56:47](https://youtu.be/iyWFulQ7apg?t=7007) heavens and earth  
[1:56:49](https://youtu.be/iyWFulQ7apg?t=7009) in in truth now if he's  
[1:56:53](https://youtu.be/iyWFulQ7apg?t=7013) he is the one who is meant to be  
[1:56:55](https://youtu.be/iyWFulQ7apg?t=7015) maintaining the  
[1:56:57](https://youtu.be/iyWFulQ7apg?t=7017) the cone or the the existence why would  
[1:57:00](https://youtu.be/iyWFulQ7apg?t=7020) he be  
[1:57:00](https://youtu.be/iyWFulQ7apg?t=7020) why would he be uh aloof to it like how  
[1:57:03](https://youtu.be/iyWFulQ7apg?t=7023) can you be  
[1:57:04](https://youtu.be/iyWFulQ7apg?t=7024) and this is actually kind of a paradox  
[1:57:06](https://youtu.be/iyWFulQ7apg?t=7026) if you're sustaining something or  
[1:57:08](https://youtu.be/iyWFulQ7apg?t=7028) maintaining it  
[1:57:09](https://youtu.be/iyWFulQ7apg?t=7029) it kind of disqualifies you from being  
[1:57:11](https://youtu.be/iyWFulQ7apg?t=7031) aloof from it  
[1:57:12](https://youtu.be/iyWFulQ7apg?t=7032) because yeah  
[1:57:16](https://youtu.be/iyWFulQ7apg?t=7036) if we can establish i think from the  
[1:57:18](https://youtu.be/iyWFulQ7apg?t=7038) most the best logical ways that we  
[1:57:20](https://youtu.be/iyWFulQ7apg?t=7040) establish that  
[1:57:21](https://youtu.be/iyWFulQ7apg?t=7041) allah or the necessary existence say  
[1:57:25](https://youtu.be/iyWFulQ7apg?t=7045) the necessary existence is um it's  
[1:57:28](https://youtu.be/iyWFulQ7apg?t=7048) pre-eternal and post-eternal and  
[1:57:30](https://youtu.be/iyWFulQ7apg?t=7050) they're unnecessary therefore everything  
[1:57:31](https://youtu.be/iyWFulQ7apg?t=7051) depends upon him  
[1:57:33](https://youtu.be/iyWFulQ7apg?t=7053) and so on all those things that we know  
[1:57:34](https://youtu.be/iyWFulQ7apg?t=7054) from the continuous argument  
[1:57:36](https://youtu.be/iyWFulQ7apg?t=7056) that the assumption is that everything  
[1:57:38](https://youtu.be/iyWFulQ7apg?t=7058) needs him in order to  
[1:57:40](https://youtu.be/iyWFulQ7apg?t=7060) continue and if everything needs him in  
[1:57:43](https://youtu.be/iyWFulQ7apg?t=7063) order to continue that means he is  
[1:57:45](https://youtu.be/iyWFulQ7apg?t=7065) by logical necessity uh  
[1:57:48](https://youtu.be/iyWFulQ7apg?t=7068) always pray always present in the uh  
[1:57:51](https://youtu.be/iyWFulQ7apg?t=7071) in the running of the universe so he's  
[1:57:53](https://youtu.be/iyWFulQ7apg?t=7073) he's not leaving the universe  
[1:57:55](https://youtu.be/iyWFulQ7apg?t=7075) yeah so the only exception that these  
[1:57:57](https://youtu.be/iyWFulQ7apg?t=7077) will have to make is for the human being  
[1:57:58](https://youtu.be/iyWFulQ7apg?t=7078) so allah is  
[1:57:59](https://youtu.be/iyWFulQ7apg?t=7079) maintaining everything uh and then  
[1:58:03](https://youtu.be/iyWFulQ7apg?t=7083) the idea is that the human being these  
[1:58:04](https://youtu.be/iyWFulQ7apg?t=7084) sentient creatures now  
[1:58:06](https://youtu.be/iyWFulQ7apg?t=7086) they they just left like that yeah which  
[1:58:08](https://youtu.be/iyWFulQ7apg?t=7088) for me would would be completely like  
[1:58:10](https://youtu.be/iyWFulQ7apg?t=7090) they would have to explain that why is  
[1:58:12](https://youtu.be/iyWFulQ7apg?t=7092) that the case that's a good point you're  
[1:58:14](https://youtu.be/iyWFulQ7apg?t=7094) putting owners on them yeah the owners  
[1:58:15](https://youtu.be/iyWFulQ7apg?t=7095) have to be on them because if  
[1:58:17](https://youtu.be/iyWFulQ7apg?t=7097) if this necessary exists if we get them  
[1:58:19](https://youtu.be/iyWFulQ7apg?t=7099) to a point of saying that everything  
[1:58:20](https://youtu.be/iyWFulQ7apg?t=7100) depends upon him and always  
[1:58:22](https://youtu.be/iyWFulQ7apg?t=7102) and that he's maintaining it and  
[1:58:23](https://youtu.be/iyWFulQ7apg?t=7103) sustaining it always then  
[1:58:26](https://youtu.be/iyWFulQ7apg?t=7106) the question is then he is involved  
[1:58:28](https://youtu.be/iyWFulQ7apg?t=7108) always and if he's always involved then  
[1:58:30](https://youtu.be/iyWFulQ7apg?t=7110) that's involvement his person is his  
[1:58:32](https://youtu.be/iyWFulQ7apg?t=7112) personality if you like  
[1:58:33](https://youtu.be/iyWFulQ7apg?t=7113) it's him being personally involved yeah  
[1:58:35](https://youtu.be/iyWFulQ7apg?t=7115) and so if he's  
[1:58:36](https://youtu.be/iyWFulQ7apg?t=7116) involved that he's personally involved  
[1:58:39](https://youtu.be/iyWFulQ7apg?t=7119) um  
[1:58:39](https://youtu.be/iyWFulQ7apg?t=7119) then this idea of deism already is like  
[1:58:42](https://youtu.be/iyWFulQ7apg?t=7122) 90  
[1:58:42](https://youtu.be/iyWFulQ7apg?t=7122) god now you have to ask the question why  
[1:58:44](https://youtu.be/iyWFulQ7apg?t=7124) would the human being be the exception  
[1:58:46](https://youtu.be/iyWFulQ7apg?t=7126) to the rule of everything being  
[1:58:48](https://youtu.be/iyWFulQ7apg?t=7128) maintained how could the  
[1:58:49](https://youtu.be/iyWFulQ7apg?t=7129) yani how could the human being be an  
[1:58:51](https://youtu.be/iyWFulQ7apg?t=7131) exceptional and there's a beautiful  
[1:58:53](https://youtu.be/iyWFulQ7apg?t=7133) oh there's a beautiful a in the quran  
[1:58:54](https://youtu.be/iyWFulQ7apg?t=7134) man  
[1:58:56](https://youtu.be/iyWFulQ7apg?t=7136) which goes like this  
[1:58:59](https://youtu.be/iyWFulQ7apg?t=7139) which goes  
[1:59:07](https://youtu.be/iyWFulQ7apg?t=7147) yeah this is this is a like one such a  
[1:59:10](https://youtu.be/iyWFulQ7apg?t=7150) powerful like  
[1:59:10](https://youtu.be/iyWFulQ7apg?t=7150) we're talking about the expressions of  
[1:59:12](https://youtu.be/iyWFulQ7apg?t=7152) quran there's no refuge  
[1:59:15](https://youtu.be/iyWFulQ7apg?t=7155) and basically he's talking about these  
[1:59:16](https://youtu.be/iyWFulQ7apg?t=7156) three people oh yeah yeah yeah yeah  
[1:59:18](https://youtu.be/iyWFulQ7apg?t=7158) there are three people that were left  
[1:59:19](https://youtu.be/iyWFulQ7apg?t=7159) behind  
[1:59:20](https://youtu.be/iyWFulQ7apg?t=7160) yeah and then the earth was constricted  
[1:59:24](https://youtu.be/iyWFulQ7apg?t=7164) and then it says uh and then it says  
[1:59:27](https://youtu.be/iyWFulQ7apg?t=7167) this beautiful phrase which says that  
[1:59:30](https://youtu.be/iyWFulQ7apg?t=7170) they thought that there was no mel ja'a  
[1:59:32](https://youtu.be/iyWFulQ7apg?t=7172) there was no maljet there was no  
[1:59:34](https://youtu.be/iyWFulQ7apg?t=7174) um a refuge from allah except to him  
[1:59:37](https://youtu.be/iyWFulQ7apg?t=7177) to him yeah so they knew that there was  
[1:59:40](https://youtu.be/iyWFulQ7apg?t=7180) no management there was no refuge from  
[1:59:42](https://youtu.be/iyWFulQ7apg?t=7182) allah except for himself in other words  
[1:59:44](https://youtu.be/iyWFulQ7apg?t=7184) we are forced to be in a relationship  
[1:59:47](https://youtu.be/iyWFulQ7apg?t=7187) with allah  
[1:59:48](https://youtu.be/iyWFulQ7apg?t=7188) by the fact by virtue of the fact that  
[1:59:50](https://youtu.be/iyWFulQ7apg?t=7190) he created and is maintaining  
[1:59:51](https://youtu.be/iyWFulQ7apg?t=7191) and and there's no way we can go where  
[1:59:53](https://youtu.be/iyWFulQ7apg?t=7193) allah is not in control basically  
[1:59:55](https://youtu.be/iyWFulQ7apg?t=7195) if that's the case we're forced to be in  
[1:59:57](https://youtu.be/iyWFulQ7apg?t=7197) a relationship and the deism is uh  
[1:59:59](https://youtu.be/iyWFulQ7apg?t=7199) basically untenable from the angle yeah  
[2:00:01](https://youtu.be/iyWFulQ7apg?t=7201) absolutely absolutely it's a brother  
[2:00:04](https://youtu.be/iyWFulQ7apg?t=7204) joining us that was the exactly the

[2:01:05](https://youtu.be/iyWFulQ7apg?t=7265) so i think in  
[2:01:09](https://youtu.be/iyWFulQ7apg?t=7269) that the mountains move how could we  
[2:01:13](https://youtu.be/iyWFulQ7apg?t=7273) uh scientifically explain that  
[2:01:17](https://youtu.be/iyWFulQ7apg?t=7277) mountains move or that which of us are  
[2:01:20](https://youtu.be/iyWFulQ7apg?t=7280) talking about  
[2:01:22](https://youtu.be/iyWFulQ7apg?t=7282) i don't really remember yeah  
[2:01:25](https://youtu.be/iyWFulQ7apg?t=7285) kind of that what the  
[2:01:29](https://youtu.be/iyWFulQ7apg?t=7289) the mountains move what at the mountains  
[2:01:36](https://youtu.be/iyWFulQ7apg?t=7296) are you referring to uh um allah is  
[2:01:38](https://youtu.be/iyWFulQ7apg?t=7298) referring to the day of judgment  
[2:01:41](https://youtu.be/iyWFulQ7apg?t=7301) yeah yeah yeah this is sort of  
[2:01:45](https://youtu.be/iyWFulQ7apg?t=7305) i think uh that's the only place where  
[2:01:47](https://youtu.be/iyWFulQ7apg?t=7307) people say this  
[2:01:48](https://youtu.be/iyWFulQ7apg?t=7308) well allah  
[2:02:05](https://youtu.be/iyWFulQ7apg?t=7325) the egyptian uh personality who  
[2:02:08](https://youtu.be/iyWFulQ7apg?t=7328) masha allah he done like uh  
[2:02:12](https://youtu.be/iyWFulQ7apg?t=7332) of the quran of the quran  
[2:02:16](https://youtu.be/iyWFulQ7apg?t=7336) he famously had he famously had the  
[2:02:18](https://youtu.be/iyWFulQ7apg?t=7338) belief that this was talking about  
[2:02:21](https://youtu.be/iyWFulQ7apg?t=7341) uh this dunya but from my before  
[2:02:24](https://youtu.be/iyWFulQ7apg?t=7344) when i looked into the masala i looked  
[2:02:27](https://youtu.be/iyWFulQ7apg?t=7347) into  
[2:02:28](https://youtu.be/iyWFulQ7apg?t=7348) and the majority of the alamat they  
[2:02:30](https://youtu.be/iyWFulQ7apg?t=7350) believe this is talking about the day of  
[2:02:31](https://youtu.be/iyWFulQ7apg?t=7351) judgment  
[2:02:33](https://youtu.be/iyWFulQ7apg?t=7353) um okay yeah  
[2:02:36](https://youtu.be/iyWFulQ7apg?t=7356) so it hasn't any regards to the  
[2:02:39](https://youtu.be/iyWFulQ7apg?t=7359) earth plates or anything if it was  
[2:02:42](https://youtu.be/iyWFulQ7apg?t=7362) talking about it  
[2:02:43](https://youtu.be/iyWFulQ7apg?t=7363) then it could be the case that is  
[2:02:45](https://youtu.be/iyWFulQ7apg?t=7365) talking about the rotations of the earth  
[2:02:47](https://youtu.be/iyWFulQ7apg?t=7367) because  
[2:02:47](https://youtu.be/iyWFulQ7apg?t=7367) in in effect yeah i mean there's  
[2:02:50](https://youtu.be/iyWFulQ7apg?t=7370) spinning around and the  
[2:02:51](https://youtu.be/iyWFulQ7apg?t=7371) mountains on it but i don't think this  
[2:02:52](https://youtu.be/iyWFulQ7apg?t=7372) is what it's talking about because the  
[2:02:53](https://youtu.be/iyWFulQ7apg?t=7373) presentation  
[2:02:55](https://youtu.be/iyWFulQ7apg?t=7375) doesn't go into detail about the  
[2:02:56](https://youtu.be/iyWFulQ7apg?t=7376) rotation of the earth  
[2:02:59](https://youtu.be/iyWFulQ7apg?t=7379) you know it's talking about you know in  
[2:03:00](https://youtu.be/iyWFulQ7apg?t=7380) the quran  
[2:03:03](https://youtu.be/iyWFulQ7apg?t=7383) you know he put on the earth these  
[2:03:06](https://youtu.be/iyWFulQ7apg?t=7386) mountains so that it doesn't shake  
[2:03:09](https://youtu.be/iyWFulQ7apg?t=7389) this is more the presentation of the  
[2:03:10](https://youtu.be/iyWFulQ7apg?t=7390) quran it's talking about  
[2:03:16](https://youtu.be/iyWFulQ7apg?t=7396) the outer crust of the earth more  
[2:03:19](https://youtu.be/iyWFulQ7apg?t=7399) more than the planet earth itself  
[2:03:23](https://youtu.be/iyWFulQ7apg?t=7403) that usually they have is that how could  
[2:03:24](https://youtu.be/iyWFulQ7apg?t=7404) we talking about well we know that  
[2:03:26](https://youtu.be/iyWFulQ7apg?t=7406) mountains uh don't do that they they  
[2:03:30](https://youtu.be/iyWFulQ7apg?t=7410) have an objection to that they say  
[2:03:32](https://youtu.be/iyWFulQ7apg?t=7412) mountains don't cause stability they  
[2:03:34](https://youtu.be/iyWFulQ7apg?t=7414) cause  
[2:03:35](https://youtu.be/iyWFulQ7apg?t=7415) uh they're called instability but the  
[2:03:36](https://youtu.be/iyWFulQ7apg?t=7416) truth of the matter is  
[2:03:38](https://youtu.be/iyWFulQ7apg?t=7418) i mean i was looking at the science of  
[2:03:40](https://youtu.be/iyWFulQ7apg?t=7420) this and it's a principle in geology  
[2:03:42](https://youtu.be/iyWFulQ7apg?t=7422) called i sophisy  
[2:03:43](https://youtu.be/iyWFulQ7apg?t=7423) um which is basically the idea that  
[2:03:47](https://youtu.be/iyWFulQ7apg?t=7427) it's talking about the ability of the uh  
[2:03:49](https://youtu.be/iyWFulQ7apg?t=7429) of of the mountains and so on  
[2:03:51](https://youtu.be/iyWFulQ7apg?t=7431) but the truth of the matter is isosceles  
[2:03:53](https://youtu.be/iyWFulQ7apg?t=7433) and its conceptions have changed  
[2:03:55](https://youtu.be/iyWFulQ7apg?t=7435) dramatically over the past hundred years  
[2:03:57](https://youtu.be/iyWFulQ7apg?t=7437) like uh from from the 1800s when this  
[2:04:00](https://youtu.be/iyWFulQ7apg?t=7440) guy  
[2:04:00](https://youtu.be/iyWFulQ7apg?t=7440) dutton wrote in and jolly and it's  
[2:04:03](https://youtu.be/iyWFulQ7apg?t=7443) changed over 100 years has cringed quite  
[2:04:05](https://youtu.be/iyWFulQ7apg?t=7445) a lot the truth of the matter we don't  
[2:04:06](https://youtu.be/iyWFulQ7apg?t=7446) know what would happen if the mountains  
[2:04:08](https://youtu.be/iyWFulQ7apg?t=7448) were taken out of their place  
[2:04:09](https://youtu.be/iyWFulQ7apg?t=7449) what was happening i mean what we know  
[2:04:11](https://youtu.be/iyWFulQ7apg?t=7451) is that  
[2:04:12](https://youtu.be/iyWFulQ7apg?t=7452) hello adam i'm not a geologist by the  
[2:04:14](https://youtu.be/iyWFulQ7apg?t=7454) way i mean it's a hula guard he wrote a  
[2:04:15](https://youtu.be/iyWFulQ7apg?t=7455) book on this  
[2:04:16](https://youtu.be/iyWFulQ7apg?t=7456) isosceles and so on you know he's a he's  
[2:04:18](https://youtu.be/iyWFulQ7apg?t=7458) to be fair he's a geologist  
[2:04:22](https://youtu.be/iyWFulQ7apg?t=7462) yeah he wrote a book like a 90 page  
[2:04:25](https://youtu.be/iyWFulQ7apg?t=7465) document on it and isosceles and so on  
[2:04:27](https://youtu.be/iyWFulQ7apg?t=7467) and when i was looking at some of the  
[2:04:28](https://youtu.be/iyWFulQ7apg?t=7468) books they were saying that when you  
[2:04:30](https://youtu.be/iyWFulQ7apg?t=7470) take out  
[2:04:30](https://youtu.be/iyWFulQ7apg?t=7470) galatians because they had this i um  
[2:04:32](https://youtu.be/iyWFulQ7apg?t=7472) when glaciers when uh ice glaciers they  
[2:04:34](https://youtu.be/iyWFulQ7apg?t=7474) melt yeah  
[2:04:36](https://youtu.be/iyWFulQ7apg?t=7476) and they think that when ice glaze is  
[2:04:37](https://youtu.be/iyWFulQ7apg?t=7477) not something called uplift takes place  
[2:04:40](https://youtu.be/iyWFulQ7apg?t=7480) which is basically like instability of  
[2:04:42](https://youtu.be/iyWFulQ7apg?t=7482) the  
[2:04:43](https://youtu.be/iyWFulQ7apg?t=7483) of the of that particular earth crust  
[2:04:46](https://youtu.be/iyWFulQ7apg?t=7486) and so  
[2:04:47](https://youtu.be/iyWFulQ7apg?t=7487) yeah i needed to kill him there but the  
[2:04:49](https://youtu.be/iyWFulQ7apg?t=7489) truth about us we don't know what  
[2:04:50](https://youtu.be/iyWFulQ7apg?t=7490) happened if you uproot mountains  
[2:04:52](https://youtu.be/iyWFulQ7apg?t=7492) the the quranic consumption is that if  
[2:04:54](https://youtu.be/iyWFulQ7apg?t=7494) you if you uproot a mountain  
[2:04:55](https://youtu.be/iyWFulQ7apg?t=7495) then there's going to be major  
[2:04:56](https://youtu.be/iyWFulQ7apg?t=7496) instability that's the definitely a  
[2:04:59](https://youtu.be/iyWFulQ7apg?t=7499) function of  
[2:04:59](https://youtu.be/iyWFulQ7apg?t=7499) because mountains were meant to be a  
[2:05:01](https://youtu.be/iyWFulQ7apg?t=7501) force for stability so if you uproot  
[2:05:03](https://youtu.be/iyWFulQ7apg?t=7503) them there's going to create a  
[2:05:04](https://youtu.be/iyWFulQ7apg?t=7504) huge uplift or something like that  
[2:05:10](https://youtu.be/iyWFulQ7apg?t=7510) [Music]  
[2:05:14](https://youtu.be/iyWFulQ7apg?t=7514) we've received a question and i really  
[2:05:15](https://youtu.be/iyWFulQ7apg?t=7515) thought hijab would be  
[2:05:17](https://youtu.be/iyWFulQ7apg?t=7517) best placed to use the you know  
[2:05:20](https://youtu.be/iyWFulQ7apg?t=7520) the the milsian um perspective  
[2:05:24](https://youtu.be/iyWFulQ7apg?t=7524) to to uh to address this so sapien seems  
[2:05:26](https://youtu.be/iyWFulQ7apg?t=7526) to do if atheists base their morality on  
[2:05:28](https://youtu.be/iyWFulQ7apg?t=7528) the harm principle  
[2:05:29](https://youtu.be/iyWFulQ7apg?t=7529) does that mean it's okay to sexually  
[2:05:31](https://youtu.be/iyWFulQ7apg?t=7531) molest a woman that's asleep if she  
[2:05:33](https://youtu.be/iyWFulQ7apg?t=7533) doesn't know what's going on  
[2:05:36](https://youtu.be/iyWFulQ7apg?t=7536) no i i think this is a bit crude like i  
[2:05:39](https://youtu.be/iyWFulQ7apg?t=7539) i think from a liberal perspective  
[2:05:40](https://youtu.be/iyWFulQ7apg?t=7540) that's  
[2:05:41](https://youtu.be/iyWFulQ7apg?t=7541) um you know if she doesn't know what's  
[2:05:43](https://youtu.be/iyWFulQ7apg?t=7543) going on  
[2:05:44](https://youtu.be/iyWFulQ7apg?t=7544) at the end of the day even liberals they  
[2:05:46](https://youtu.be/iyWFulQ7apg?t=7546) have like  
[2:05:48](https://youtu.be/iyWFulQ7apg?t=7548) uh principles that they have their red  
[2:05:50](https://youtu.be/iyWFulQ7apg?t=7550) lines and i i think this would be one of  
[2:05:52](https://youtu.be/iyWFulQ7apg?t=7552) them because  
[2:05:53](https://youtu.be/iyWFulQ7apg?t=7553) it would be it will be seen as obviously  
[2:05:55](https://youtu.be/iyWFulQ7apg?t=7555) the three things that they  
[2:05:56](https://youtu.be/iyWFulQ7apg?t=7556) um prioritize is wealth property  
[2:06:00](https://youtu.be/iyWFulQ7apg?t=7560) and liberty you know uh and so  
[2:06:03](https://youtu.be/iyWFulQ7apg?t=7563) this would be an infringement of  
[2:06:05](https://youtu.be/iyWFulQ7apg?t=7565) freedoms of that person who's asleep  
[2:06:07](https://youtu.be/iyWFulQ7apg?t=7567) uh that's liberalism this is asking  
[2:06:10](https://youtu.be/iyWFulQ7apg?t=7570) about the harm principle  
[2:06:12](https://youtu.be/iyWFulQ7apg?t=7572) and if atheists base their morality just  
[2:06:14](https://youtu.be/iyWFulQ7apg?t=7574) on the harm principle  
[2:06:15](https://youtu.be/iyWFulQ7apg?t=7575) no they don't just but yeah so they  
[2:06:16](https://youtu.be/iyWFulQ7apg?t=7576) don't understand that so if if we took  
[2:06:18](https://youtu.be/iyWFulQ7apg?t=7578) this question  
[2:06:20](https://youtu.be/iyWFulQ7apg?t=7580) yeah yeah it's not a good way to argue i  
[2:06:22](https://youtu.be/iyWFulQ7apg?t=7582) don't think okay  
[2:06:23](https://youtu.be/iyWFulQ7apg?t=7583) they don't they don't um just promise  
[2:06:26](https://youtu.be/iyWFulQ7apg?t=7586) you on that there's a whole  
[2:06:28](https://youtu.be/iyWFulQ7apg?t=7588) section of liberalism which talks about  
[2:06:29](https://youtu.be/iyWFulQ7apg?t=7589) contract law and consent is huge in  
[2:06:31](https://youtu.be/iyWFulQ7apg?t=7591) liberalism as well we shouldn't under  
[2:06:33](https://youtu.be/iyWFulQ7apg?t=7593) like uh underestimate that show that  
[2:06:36](https://youtu.be/iyWFulQ7apg?t=7596) part of it  
[2:06:36](https://youtu.be/iyWFulQ7apg?t=7596) brilliant all right next is  
[2:06:42](https://youtu.be/iyWFulQ7apg?t=7602) mirai  
[2:06:53](https://youtu.be/iyWFulQ7apg?t=7613) okay uh my question is uh regarding um  
[2:06:57](https://youtu.be/iyWFulQ7apg?t=7617) uh  
[2:06:58](https://youtu.be/iyWFulQ7apg?t=7618) the sharia in the bible um and i think  
[2:07:01](https://youtu.be/iyWFulQ7apg?t=7621) it's an important question because uh we  
[2:07:02](https://youtu.be/iyWFulQ7apg?t=7622) we tend to use and i find you guys also  
[2:07:05](https://youtu.be/iyWFulQ7apg?t=7625) using this  
[2:07:06](https://youtu.be/iyWFulQ7apg?t=7626) when uh making out to the christian  
[2:07:07](https://youtu.be/iyWFulQ7apg?t=7627) brothers and sisters so uh you know how  
[2:07:09](https://youtu.be/iyWFulQ7apg?t=7629) us as muslims right we use the quran  
[2:07:12](https://youtu.be/iyWFulQ7apg?t=7632) to as as the criteria of akida to  
[2:07:15](https://youtu.be/iyWFulQ7apg?t=7635) distinguish the truth and falsehood and  
[2:07:17](https://youtu.be/iyWFulQ7apg?t=7637) other scriptures  
[2:07:18](https://youtu.be/iyWFulQ7apg?t=7638) right like the bible for example but  
[2:07:20](https://youtu.be/iyWFulQ7apg?t=7640) when it comes and we us muslims believe  
[2:07:22](https://youtu.be/iyWFulQ7apg?t=7642) that  
[2:07:23](https://youtu.be/iyWFulQ7apg?t=7643) they remain the same for all of human  
[2:07:25](https://youtu.be/iyWFulQ7apg?t=7645) history  
[2:07:26](https://youtu.be/iyWFulQ7apg?t=7646) but the shariah changed right so when it  
[2:07:29](https://youtu.be/iyWFulQ7apg?t=7649) comes to  
[2:07:30](https://youtu.be/iyWFulQ7apg?t=7650) violent verses in the bible like for  
[2:07:31](https://youtu.be/iyWFulQ7apg?t=7651) example um burning your daughter a lie  
[2:07:33](https://youtu.be/iyWFulQ7apg?t=7653) like  
[2:07:33](https://youtu.be/iyWFulQ7apg?t=7653) burning the daughter's priest alive or  
[2:07:35](https://youtu.be/iyWFulQ7apg?t=7655) uh when moses uh musa  
[2:07:38](https://youtu.be/iyWFulQ7apg?t=7658) in the bible told told um told the  
[2:07:41](https://youtu.be/iyWFulQ7apg?t=7661) you know go kill uh kill the women and  
[2:07:43](https://youtu.be/iyWFulQ7apg?t=7663) take the  
[2:07:44](https://youtu.be/iyWFulQ7apg?t=7664) the girls and all this stuff how do we  
[2:07:47](https://youtu.be/iyWFulQ7apg?t=7667) act  
[2:07:47](https://youtu.be/iyWFulQ7apg?t=7667) what criteria do we use how do we  
[2:07:49](https://youtu.be/iyWFulQ7apg?t=7669) actually know that this is something  
[2:07:50](https://youtu.be/iyWFulQ7apg?t=7670) that was  
[2:07:51](https://youtu.be/iyWFulQ7apg?t=7671) fabricated or corrupted and not the  
[2:07:54](https://youtu.be/iyWFulQ7apg?t=7674) sharia at the time of bani israel from  
[2:07:56](https://youtu.be/iyWFulQ7apg?t=7676) allah  
[2:07:57](https://youtu.be/iyWFulQ7apg?t=7677) very good question if if it's in  
[2:08:00](https://youtu.be/iyWFulQ7apg?t=7680) contradiction of the quran  
[2:08:02](https://youtu.be/iyWFulQ7apg?t=7682) then his fabric we would believe it's  
[2:08:04](https://youtu.be/iyWFulQ7apg?t=7684) not something which is correct because  
[2:08:06](https://youtu.be/iyWFulQ7apg?t=7686) you know there is that injunction  
[2:08:12](https://youtu.be/iyWFulQ7apg?t=7692) you know do not believe them and do not  
[2:08:15](https://youtu.be/iyWFulQ7apg?t=7695) agree with them  
[2:08:17](https://youtu.be/iyWFulQ7apg?t=7697) uh yeah if something is not if something  
[2:08:20](https://youtu.be/iyWFulQ7apg?t=7700) the quran  
[2:08:20](https://youtu.be/iyWFulQ7apg?t=7700) has spoken about then remain agnostic  
[2:08:23](https://youtu.be/iyWFulQ7apg?t=7703) about i don't speak too much about it  
[2:08:24](https://youtu.be/iyWFulQ7apg?t=7704) and that's  
[2:08:25](https://youtu.be/iyWFulQ7apg?t=7705) i think a mistake sometimes we make like  
[2:08:27](https://youtu.be/iyWFulQ7apg?t=7707) for example on the issue of  
[2:08:28](https://youtu.be/iyWFulQ7apg?t=7708) a global flood we will jump into the  
[2:08:31](https://youtu.be/iyWFulQ7apg?t=7711) fact that we say nothing  
[2:08:32](https://youtu.be/iyWFulQ7apg?t=7712) biblical it's explicit but it's true in  
[2:08:35](https://youtu.be/iyWFulQ7apg?t=7715) the bible what if in the next 20 or 30  
[2:08:37](https://youtu.be/iyWFulQ7apg?t=7717) years  
[2:08:37](https://youtu.be/iyWFulQ7apg?t=7717) hundred years they found out that there  
[2:08:39](https://youtu.be/iyWFulQ7apg?t=7719) was a global flood  
[2:08:40](https://youtu.be/iyWFulQ7apg?t=7720) now everyone's going to say that we are  
[2:08:42](https://youtu.be/iyWFulQ7apg?t=7722) the quran is talking about a local club  
[2:08:43](https://youtu.be/iyWFulQ7apg?t=7723) and their  
[2:08:44](https://youtu.be/iyWFulQ7apg?t=7724) christians will start rejoicing but the  
[2:08:45](https://youtu.be/iyWFulQ7apg?t=7725) truth of the matter is  
[2:08:47](https://youtu.be/iyWFulQ7apg?t=7727) there's nothing clear in the quran and  
[2:08:49](https://youtu.be/iyWFulQ7apg?t=7729) you know what beautiful about that point  
[2:08:51](https://youtu.be/iyWFulQ7apg?t=7731) hijab  
[2:08:51](https://youtu.be/iyWFulQ7apg?t=7731) is that um you know  
[2:08:54](https://youtu.be/iyWFulQ7apg?t=7734) we sometimes go with the flow we go with  
[2:08:57](https://youtu.be/iyWFulQ7apg?t=7737) what's popular we go with  
[2:08:59](https://youtu.be/iyWFulQ7apg?t=7739) you know the narrative of the day but  
[2:09:00](https://youtu.be/iyWFulQ7apg?t=7740) even with this global flood which for  
[2:09:02](https://youtu.be/iyWFulQ7apg?t=7742) some  
[2:09:03](https://youtu.be/iyWFulQ7apg?t=7743) muslims it was like oh this seems a bit  
[2:09:06](https://youtu.be/iyWFulQ7apg?t=7746) difficult to try and articulate let's  
[2:09:09](https://youtu.be/iyWFulQ7apg?t=7749) just stick with the local one  
[2:09:11](https://youtu.be/iyWFulQ7apg?t=7751) archaeologically not archaeologically  
[2:09:13](https://youtu.be/iyWFulQ7apg?t=7753) from a uh  
[2:09:15](https://youtu.be/iyWFulQ7apg?t=7755) anthropology point of view we're  
[2:09:17](https://youtu.be/iyWFulQ7apg?t=7757) actually getting evidence  
[2:09:18](https://youtu.be/iyWFulQ7apg?t=7758) that various different human populations  
[2:09:21](https://youtu.be/iyWFulQ7apg?t=7761) which have not interacted  
[2:09:23](https://youtu.be/iyWFulQ7apg?t=7763) they all have this flood myth this seems  
[2:09:26](https://youtu.be/iyWFulQ7apg?t=7766) to be a  
[2:09:26](https://youtu.be/iyWFulQ7apg?t=7766) common thing i'm not sure if you know  
[2:09:28](https://youtu.be/iyWFulQ7apg?t=7768) about this organization  
[2:09:30](https://youtu.be/iyWFulQ7apg?t=7770) yeah just repeat repeated even in south  
[2:09:32](https://youtu.be/iyWFulQ7apg?t=7772) america you get this you get this idea  
[2:09:34](https://youtu.be/iyWFulQ7apg?t=7774) that there was a flood and it took out  
[2:09:36](https://youtu.be/iyWFulQ7apg?t=7776) people and people tell their children  
[2:09:38](https://youtu.be/iyWFulQ7apg?t=7778) and  
[2:09:38](https://youtu.be/iyWFulQ7apg?t=7778) there's this ancestral story of this  
[2:09:41](https://youtu.be/iyWFulQ7apg?t=7781) flood  
[2:09:42](https://youtu.be/iyWFulQ7apg?t=7782) and there's something there and from  
[2:09:49](https://youtu.be/iyWFulQ7apg?t=7789) sociological point of view it's bizarre  
[2:09:51](https://youtu.be/iyWFulQ7apg?t=7791) right from for them because  
[2:09:53](https://youtu.be/iyWFulQ7apg?t=7793) it doesn't make sense like why is this  
[2:09:55](https://youtu.be/iyWFulQ7apg?t=7795) repeated thing  
[2:09:56](https://youtu.be/iyWFulQ7apg?t=7796) coming up in many many times so i hope  
[2:09:58](https://youtu.be/iyWFulQ7apg?t=7798) that principle will help  
[2:10:00](https://youtu.be/iyWFulQ7apg?t=7800) you uh address these types of questions  
[2:10:01](https://youtu.be/iyWFulQ7apg?t=7801) yeah but but see that's the thing that  
[2:10:04](https://youtu.be/iyWFulQ7apg?t=7804) what you're talking about are the  
[2:10:05](https://youtu.be/iyWFulQ7apg?t=7805) israelites and the stories and  
[2:10:07](https://youtu.be/iyWFulQ7apg?t=7807) but i'm talking about the sharia laws  
[2:10:09](https://youtu.be/iyWFulQ7apg?t=7809) that are found in the bible like  
[2:10:11](https://youtu.be/iyWFulQ7apg?t=7811) uh like the like the uh  
[2:10:17](https://youtu.be/iyWFulQ7apg?t=7817) but the difference here is um you see  
[2:10:20](https://youtu.be/iyWFulQ7apg?t=7820) the sharia is different  
[2:10:21](https://youtu.be/iyWFulQ7apg?t=7821) but allah's paradigm is the same the  
[2:10:24](https://youtu.be/iyWFulQ7apg?t=7824) sunnah of allah is the same allah does  
[2:10:26](https://youtu.be/iyWFulQ7apg?t=7826) not do injustice to anyone so when allah  
[2:10:28](https://youtu.be/iyWFulQ7apg?t=7828) for example  
[2:10:29](https://youtu.be/iyWFulQ7apg?t=7829) alcohol say may have been allowed for  
[2:10:32](https://youtu.be/iyWFulQ7apg?t=7832) certain people  
[2:10:33](https://youtu.be/iyWFulQ7apg?t=7833) and not allowed in sharia hypothetically  
[2:10:35](https://youtu.be/iyWFulQ7apg?t=7835) say yeah when it comes to  
[2:10:37](https://youtu.be/iyWFulQ7apg?t=7837) does allah do injustice no it doesn't  
[2:10:39](https://youtu.be/iyWFulQ7apg?t=7839) matter what the sharia is for the  
[2:10:41](https://youtu.be/iyWFulQ7apg?t=7841) different different  
[2:10:42](https://youtu.be/iyWFulQ7apg?t=7842) generations allah doesn't do injustice  
[2:10:45](https://youtu.be/iyWFulQ7apg?t=7845) when it comes to  
[2:10:46](https://youtu.be/iyWFulQ7apg?t=7846) a situation like um so would allah have  
[2:10:50](https://youtu.be/iyWFulQ7apg?t=7850) allowed shirk  
[2:10:51](https://youtu.be/iyWFulQ7apg?t=7851) to be normal in in no because allah does  
[2:10:54](https://youtu.be/iyWFulQ7apg?t=7854) not allow  
[2:10:55](https://youtu.be/iyWFulQ7apg?t=7855) so the principles of allah that would  
[2:10:57](https://youtu.be/iyWFulQ7apg?t=7857) have been the same the sharia  
[2:10:58](https://youtu.be/iyWFulQ7apg?t=7858) and also one more thing to answer that  
[2:11:01](https://youtu.be/iyWFulQ7apg?t=7861) most of the allah of islam  
[2:11:03](https://youtu.be/iyWFulQ7apg?t=7863) with very few exceptions they believe  
[2:11:04](https://youtu.be/iyWFulQ7apg?t=7864) the asthma of the prophets  
[2:11:06](https://youtu.be/iyWFulQ7apg?t=7866) meaning that what does that mean  
[2:11:10](https://youtu.be/iyWFulQ7apg?t=7870) yeah meaning the infallibility of the  
[2:11:11](https://youtu.be/iyWFulQ7apg?t=7871) prophet so stories which say that  
[2:11:13](https://youtu.be/iyWFulQ7apg?t=7873) david he committed adultery or that lord  
[2:11:16](https://youtu.be/iyWFulQ7apg?t=7876) had text of his daughters  
[2:11:18](https://youtu.be/iyWFulQ7apg?t=7878) we would reject those because it goes  
[2:11:20](https://youtu.be/iyWFulQ7apg?t=7880) against our principle of asthma  
[2:11:22](https://youtu.be/iyWFulQ7apg?t=7882) it goes up against my principle of  
[2:11:24](https://youtu.be/iyWFulQ7apg?t=7884) infallibility because it's inconceivable  
[2:11:26](https://youtu.be/iyWFulQ7apg?t=7886) that  
[2:11:27](https://youtu.be/iyWFulQ7apg?t=7887) you know uh in without  
[2:11:30](https://youtu.be/iyWFulQ7apg?t=7890) without an necessity like whether  
[2:11:32](https://youtu.be/iyWFulQ7apg?t=7892) there's not going to be continuation of  
[2:11:33](https://youtu.be/iyWFulQ7apg?t=7893) generations like in the case of adam and  
[2:11:34](https://youtu.be/iyWFulQ7apg?t=7894) so on  
[2:11:35](https://youtu.be/iyWFulQ7apg?t=7895) that such things can be done by prophets  
[2:11:39](https://youtu.be/iyWFulQ7apg?t=7899) so that that's another way we can argue  
[2:11:42](https://youtu.be/iyWFulQ7apg?t=7902) that certain things  
[2:11:43](https://youtu.be/iyWFulQ7apg?t=7903) uh go against the sins of the prophet  
[2:11:45](https://youtu.be/iyWFulQ7apg?t=7905) who can we can safely say  
[2:11:47](https://youtu.be/iyWFulQ7apg?t=7907) that the prophet didn't commit  
[2:11:48](https://youtu.be/iyWFulQ7apg?t=7908) especially those major sins like  
[2:11:49](https://youtu.be/iyWFulQ7apg?t=7909) adultery and satan  
[2:11:51](https://youtu.be/iyWFulQ7apg?t=7911) would say that completely negate we  
[2:11:53](https://youtu.be/iyWFulQ7apg?t=7913) negate that even though there's nothing  
[2:11:54](https://youtu.be/iyWFulQ7apg?t=7914) uh directly quote uh  
[2:11:58](https://youtu.be/iyWFulQ7apg?t=7918) in opposition but we still uh reject  
[2:12:00](https://youtu.be/iyWFulQ7apg?t=7920) this so  
[2:12:01](https://youtu.be/iyWFulQ7apg?t=7921) in a nutshell i wouldn't go too deeply  
[2:12:03](https://youtu.be/iyWFulQ7apg?t=7923) into the jurisprudence because  
[2:12:05](https://youtu.be/iyWFulQ7apg?t=7925) the truth of the matter is what was  
[2:12:08](https://youtu.be/iyWFulQ7apg?t=7928) allowed and what wasn't allowed in  
[2:12:09](https://youtu.be/iyWFulQ7apg?t=7929) certain times in certain places  
[2:12:10](https://youtu.be/iyWFulQ7apg?t=7930) but for those things which are clearly  
[2:12:12](https://youtu.be/iyWFulQ7apg?t=7932) um  
[2:12:14](https://youtu.be/iyWFulQ7apg?t=7934) you know be merging the good name of our  
[2:12:16](https://youtu.be/iyWFulQ7apg?t=7936) prophet salallahu  
[2:12:29](https://youtu.be/iyWFulQ7apg?t=7949) [Music]  
[2:12:47](https://youtu.be/iyWFulQ7apg?t=7967) one group before a person another person  
[2:12:49](https://youtu.be/iyWFulQ7apg?t=7969) has done like a father  
[2:12:50](https://youtu.be/iyWFulQ7apg?t=7970) he's not going to be held to account for  
[2:12:51](https://youtu.be/iyWFulQ7apg?t=7971) what the fund has done so there's lots  
[2:12:53](https://youtu.be/iyWFulQ7apg?t=7973) of things that collide you can pull out  
[2:12:54](https://youtu.be/iyWFulQ7apg?t=7974) of the sharia that would negate a lot of  
[2:12:57](https://youtu.be/iyWFulQ7apg?t=7977) the biblical discourse basically  
[2:13:00](https://youtu.be/iyWFulQ7apg?t=7980) okay interesting just maybe you can  
[2:13:02](https://youtu.be/iyWFulQ7apg?t=7982) clarify this one point  
[2:13:03](https://youtu.be/iyWFulQ7apg?t=7983) maybe you can clarify on this one point  
[2:13:05](https://youtu.be/iyWFulQ7apg?t=7985) when you say that okay allah does not  
[2:13:06](https://youtu.be/iyWFulQ7apg?t=7986) deal injustice right  
[2:13:08](https://youtu.be/iyWFulQ7apg?t=7988) how do we know how do we know what was  
[2:13:10](https://youtu.be/iyWFulQ7apg?t=7990) the injustice at their time  
[2:13:12](https://youtu.be/iyWFulQ7apg?t=7992) you understand what i'm trying to say  
[2:13:13](https://youtu.be/iyWFulQ7apg?t=7993) yeah there is a great area there and  
[2:13:16](https://youtu.be/iyWFulQ7apg?t=7996) that's why we say that in terms of our  
[2:13:18](https://youtu.be/iyWFulQ7apg?t=7998) kida we can we can safely say allah  
[2:13:20](https://youtu.be/iyWFulQ7apg?t=8000) wouldn't allow  
[2:13:21](https://youtu.be/iyWFulQ7apg?t=8001) that so on and so forth uh like the  
[2:13:23](https://youtu.be/iyWFulQ7apg?t=8003) brother said  
[2:13:24](https://youtu.be/iyWFulQ7apg?t=8004) he intervened with that one soul should  
[2:13:28](https://youtu.be/iyWFulQ7apg?t=8008) not be held to account for what another  
[2:13:29](https://youtu.be/iyWFulQ7apg?t=8009) song has earned  
[2:13:30](https://youtu.be/iyWFulQ7apg?t=8010) that's another principle the asmr of the  
[2:13:32](https://youtu.be/iyWFulQ7apg?t=8012) prophets they follow the prophets and  
[2:13:34](https://youtu.be/iyWFulQ7apg?t=8014) those things which the quran  
[2:13:35](https://youtu.be/iyWFulQ7apg?t=8015) and all the sunnah have directly  
[2:13:37](https://youtu.be/iyWFulQ7apg?t=8017) rejected in terms of  
[2:13:39](https://youtu.be/iyWFulQ7apg?t=8019) uh narratives like for example  
[2:13:40](https://youtu.be/iyWFulQ7apg?t=8020) crucifixion of jesus or whatever it may  
[2:13:42](https://youtu.be/iyWFulQ7apg?t=8022) be  
[2:13:43](https://youtu.be/iyWFulQ7apg?t=8023) those four things will be enough to get  
[2:13:44](https://youtu.be/iyWFulQ7apg?t=8024) rid of like 70 or 80 percent of  
[2:13:46](https://youtu.be/iyWFulQ7apg?t=8026) the confusing narratives the the the  
[2:13:49](https://youtu.be/iyWFulQ7apg?t=8029) remaining 30  
[2:13:51](https://youtu.be/iyWFulQ7apg?t=8031) we have to we have to remain agnostic  
[2:13:57](https://youtu.be/iyWFulQ7apg?t=8037) do not believe them and do not uh and do  
[2:14:00](https://youtu.be/iyWFulQ7apg?t=8040) not agree with them  
[2:14:01](https://youtu.be/iyWFulQ7apg?t=8041) just stay just just stay quiet about it  
[2:14:03](https://youtu.be/iyWFulQ7apg?t=8043) basically  
[2:14:05](https://youtu.be/iyWFulQ7apg?t=8045) because it can come back and come back  
[2:14:07](https://youtu.be/iyWFulQ7apg?t=8047) to haunt you yeah i mean you  
[2:14:08](https://youtu.be/iyWFulQ7apg?t=8048) like you said it could be uh slavery  
[2:14:11](https://youtu.be/iyWFulQ7apg?t=8051) would have been allowed  
[2:14:12](https://youtu.be/iyWFulQ7apg?t=8052) someone's attacking the old testament by  
[2:14:14](https://youtu.be/iyWFulQ7apg?t=8054) slavery and maybe it was allowed at that  
[2:14:16](https://youtu.be/iyWFulQ7apg?t=8056) time for a certain period  
[2:14:17](https://youtu.be/iyWFulQ7apg?t=8057) we don't know we're a different kind of  
[2:14:20](https://youtu.be/iyWFulQ7apg?t=8060) indentured servitude allahu alam god  
[2:14:22](https://youtu.be/iyWFulQ7apg?t=8062) knows best  
[2:14:22](https://youtu.be/iyWFulQ7apg?t=8062) and so i would just remain a little bit  
[2:14:24](https://youtu.be/iyWFulQ7apg?t=8064) agnostic on these issues  
[2:14:27](https://youtu.be/iyWFulQ7apg?t=8067) okay  
[2:14:38](https://youtu.be/iyWFulQ7apg?t=8078) casper  
[2:14:52](https://youtu.be/iyWFulQ7apg?t=8092) um philosophy of science versus biology  
[2:14:56](https://youtu.be/iyWFulQ7apg?t=8096) and uh etc etc the chances of me going  
[2:14:58](https://youtu.be/iyWFulQ7apg?t=8098) to uni to study these things is very  
[2:15:00](https://youtu.be/iyWFulQ7apg?t=8100) very low i'm someone who's like you know  
[2:15:02](https://youtu.be/iyWFulQ7apg?t=8102) i'm eager to  
[2:15:03](https://youtu.be/iyWFulQ7apg?t=8103) critique exam darwinism etc  
[2:15:06](https://youtu.be/iyWFulQ7apg?t=8106) so how someone like me go about you know  
[2:15:08](https://youtu.be/iyWFulQ7apg?t=8108) research and studying and things like  
[2:15:09](https://youtu.be/iyWFulQ7apg?t=8109) that  
[2:15:11](https://youtu.be/iyWFulQ7apg?t=8111) well well i brought let me tell you  
[2:15:13](https://youtu.be/iyWFulQ7apg?t=8113) something like we live in a very special  
[2:15:15](https://youtu.be/iyWFulQ7apg?t=8115) time  
[2:15:15](https://youtu.be/iyWFulQ7apg?t=8115) a very special uh age because the fact  
[2:15:18](https://youtu.be/iyWFulQ7apg?t=8118) of the matter is  
[2:15:20](https://youtu.be/iyWFulQ7apg?t=8120) well you can even like you you can learn  
[2:15:22](https://youtu.be/iyWFulQ7apg?t=8122) a lot from the comfort of your own home  
[2:15:25](https://youtu.be/iyWFulQ7apg?t=8125) i was shocked today and yesterday i was  
[2:15:26](https://youtu.be/iyWFulQ7apg?t=8126) doing some research and  
[2:15:28](https://youtu.be/iyWFulQ7apg?t=8128) there's the you know there's a mocha  
[2:15:30](https://youtu.be/iyWFulQ7apg?t=8130) called the shamila like  
[2:15:31](https://youtu.be/iyWFulQ7apg?t=8131) arabic one and i was going through all  
[2:15:32](https://youtu.be/iyWFulQ7apg?t=8132) these books and i was thinking wow  
[2:15:34](https://youtu.be/iyWFulQ7apg?t=8134) this a thousand years ago someone would  
[2:15:36](https://youtu.be/iyWFulQ7apg?t=8136) have had to travel the lands in order to  
[2:15:38](https://youtu.be/iyWFulQ7apg?t=8138) get the books that i was getting and i'm  
[2:15:39](https://youtu.be/iyWFulQ7apg?t=8139) thinking  
[2:15:40](https://youtu.be/iyWFulQ7apg?t=8140) amazing like i can just do it all from  
[2:15:42](https://youtu.be/iyWFulQ7apg?t=8142) the comfort of my own  
[2:15:43](https://youtu.be/iyWFulQ7apg?t=8143) home with my little phone here it's  
[2:15:45](https://youtu.be/iyWFulQ7apg?t=8145) amazing how much you can  
[2:15:47](https://youtu.be/iyWFulQ7apg?t=8147) i mean people attack social media for  
[2:15:48](https://youtu.be/iyWFulQ7apg?t=8148) many good reasons but we don't talk  
[2:15:50](https://youtu.be/iyWFulQ7apg?t=8150) about the good  
[2:15:51](https://youtu.be/iyWFulQ7apg?t=8151) of the internet there are some things we  
[2:15:53](https://youtu.be/iyWFulQ7apg?t=8153) can do now that we can would never  
[2:15:54](https://youtu.be/iyWFulQ7apg?t=8154) have been able to do back in the days  
[2:15:56](https://youtu.be/iyWFulQ7apg?t=8156) and so  
[2:15:58](https://youtu.be/iyWFulQ7apg?t=8158) one has to really take that on board and  
[2:15:59](https://youtu.be/iyWFulQ7apg?t=8159) try and do as much as they could do  
[2:16:01](https://youtu.be/iyWFulQ7apg?t=8161) you know and and whatever if you're even  
[2:16:04](https://youtu.be/iyWFulQ7apg?t=8164) if yourself  
[2:16:05](https://youtu.be/iyWFulQ7apg?t=8165) like you you're studying something  
[2:16:07](https://youtu.be/iyWFulQ7apg?t=8167) yourself try and find like-minded people  
[2:16:09](https://youtu.be/iyWFulQ7apg?t=8169) study groups uh mentors teachers and  
[2:16:12](https://youtu.be/iyWFulQ7apg?t=8172) whatever  
[2:16:12](https://youtu.be/iyWFulQ7apg?t=8172) get reading list what i would do for you  
[2:16:14](https://youtu.be/iyWFulQ7apg?t=8174) bro i'd get reading lists from  
[2:16:15](https://youtu.be/iyWFulQ7apg?t=8175) universities top universities see their  
[2:16:16](https://youtu.be/iyWFulQ7apg?t=8176) reading let's see their modules see what  
[2:16:18](https://youtu.be/iyWFulQ7apg?t=8178) they're covering  
[2:16:19](https://youtu.be/iyWFulQ7apg?t=8179) and if you if you're doing something  
[2:16:20](https://youtu.be/iyWFulQ7apg?t=8180) like um philosophy of science see what  
[2:16:22](https://youtu.be/iyWFulQ7apg?t=8182) this course structure looks like  
[2:16:23](https://youtu.be/iyWFulQ7apg?t=8183) and start reading those books yourself  
[2:16:25](https://youtu.be/iyWFulQ7apg?t=8185) what other things  
[2:16:26](https://youtu.be/iyWFulQ7apg?t=8186) you couldn't go into university i i  
[2:16:28](https://youtu.be/iyWFulQ7apg?t=8188) totally agree with what  
[2:16:30](https://youtu.be/iyWFulQ7apg?t=8190) uh hijab is saying and what i'll add to  
[2:16:32](https://youtu.be/iyWFulQ7apg?t=8192) that actually  
[2:16:33](https://youtu.be/iyWFulQ7apg?t=8193) i'm sure hijab would agree to this um  
[2:16:36](https://youtu.be/iyWFulQ7apg?t=8196) is that at university when you  
[2:16:39](https://youtu.be/iyWFulQ7apg?t=8199) university courses when you go and look  
[2:16:41](https://youtu.be/iyWFulQ7apg?t=8201) up the reading  
[2:16:42](https://youtu.be/iyWFulQ7apg?t=8202) um that is provided by the lecturers is  
[2:16:45](https://youtu.be/iyWFulQ7apg?t=8205) actually  
[2:16:46](https://youtu.be/iyWFulQ7apg?t=8206) outdated so many of the readings that  
[2:16:48](https://youtu.be/iyWFulQ7apg?t=8208) you do independently  
[2:16:50](https://youtu.be/iyWFulQ7apg?t=8210) are actually better so recently a  
[2:16:52](https://youtu.be/iyWFulQ7apg?t=8212) brother reached out to me  
[2:16:54](https://youtu.be/iyWFulQ7apg?t=8214) and he said that he wants to do a  
[2:16:55](https://youtu.be/iyWFulQ7apg?t=8215) philosophy or science module at oxford  
[2:16:57](https://youtu.be/iyWFulQ7apg?t=8217) university  
[2:16:58](https://youtu.be/iyWFulQ7apg?t=8218) and he sent me the is just one module  
[2:17:01](https://youtu.be/iyWFulQ7apg?t=8221) that he wanted to do  
[2:17:02](https://youtu.be/iyWFulQ7apg?t=8222) and he said what do you think about it  
[2:17:04](https://youtu.be/iyWFulQ7apg?t=8224) and i looked at it and i was a bit  
[2:17:05](https://youtu.be/iyWFulQ7apg?t=8225) surprised because one of the books was  
[2:17:08](https://youtu.be/iyWFulQ7apg?t=8228) from 2001 and one of the other books was  
[2:17:11](https://youtu.be/iyWFulQ7apg?t=8231) just  
[2:17:11](https://youtu.be/iyWFulQ7apg?t=8231) a couple of years old and some of the  
[2:17:14](https://youtu.be/iyWFulQ7apg?t=8234) really important books which i came  
[2:17:15](https://youtu.be/iyWFulQ7apg?t=8235) across when i when i was doing my own  
[2:17:17](https://youtu.be/iyWFulQ7apg?t=8237) studies  
[2:17:17](https://youtu.be/iyWFulQ7apg?t=8237) they weren't even listed so you know  
[2:17:19](https://youtu.be/iyWFulQ7apg?t=8239) sometimes these lectures you have to  
[2:17:20](https://youtu.be/iyWFulQ7apg?t=8240) imagine that  
[2:17:21](https://youtu.be/iyWFulQ7apg?t=8241) they haven't updated the reading list  
[2:17:23](https://youtu.be/iyWFulQ7apg?t=8243) for these courses in  
[2:17:24](https://youtu.be/iyWFulQ7apg?t=8244) in dogs years yeah and the stuff that  
[2:17:27](https://youtu.be/iyWFulQ7apg?t=8247) you get on amazon  
[2:17:29](https://youtu.be/iyWFulQ7apg?t=8249) you know with the latest philosophy of  
[2:17:31](https://youtu.be/iyWFulQ7apg?t=8251) science books coming out  
[2:17:32](https://youtu.be/iyWFulQ7apg?t=8252) they haven't even heard of them because  
[2:17:34](https://youtu.be/iyWFulQ7apg?t=8254) they're still using lecture i mean when  
[2:17:35](https://youtu.be/iyWFulQ7apg?t=8255) i was at university i remember  
[2:17:37](https://youtu.be/iyWFulQ7apg?t=8257) you know one particular lecturer he had  
[2:17:40](https://youtu.be/iyWFulQ7apg?t=8260) notes from years ago that he used to  
[2:17:42](https://youtu.be/iyWFulQ7apg?t=8262) regurgitate he never updated  
[2:17:43](https://youtu.be/iyWFulQ7apg?t=8263) any of his information a lot of my  
[2:17:45](https://youtu.be/iyWFulQ7apg?t=8265) lasers yeah  
[2:17:46](https://youtu.be/iyWFulQ7apg?t=8266) because you have to go back in yeah you  
[2:17:49](https://youtu.be/iyWFulQ7apg?t=8269) have to go back and  
[2:17:50](https://youtu.be/iyWFulQ7apg?t=8270) change the powerpoint slides and whatnot  
[2:17:52](https://youtu.be/iyWFulQ7apg?t=8272) can't be bothered so i totally agree i  
[2:17:54](https://youtu.be/iyWFulQ7apg?t=8274) mean that's a beautiful example you can  
[2:17:55](https://youtu.be/iyWFulQ7apg?t=8275) learn so many things  
[2:17:57](https://youtu.be/iyWFulQ7apg?t=8277) uh independently um and and you know we  
[2:18:00](https://youtu.be/iyWFulQ7apg?t=8280) have this inferiority complex  
[2:18:02](https://youtu.be/iyWFulQ7apg?t=8282) uh all of us that you know i have to be  
[2:18:04](https://youtu.be/iyWFulQ7apg?t=8284) part of an institute to really learn  
[2:18:06](https://youtu.be/iyWFulQ7apg?t=8286) that's not true at all  
[2:18:07](https://youtu.be/iyWFulQ7apg?t=8287) i mean i consider you know hijab an  
[2:18:09](https://youtu.be/iyWFulQ7apg?t=8289) expert when it comes to  
[2:18:10](https://youtu.be/iyWFulQ7apg?t=8290) dealing with liberalism but sometimes  
[2:18:12](https://youtu.be/iyWFulQ7apg?t=8292) you can have a muslim who studied  
[2:18:14](https://youtu.be/iyWFulQ7apg?t=8294) liberalism academically at university  
[2:18:17](https://youtu.be/iyWFulQ7apg?t=8297) but because they haven't read around  
[2:18:19](https://youtu.be/iyWFulQ7apg?t=8299) they can't really deal with it because  
[2:18:21](https://youtu.be/iyWFulQ7apg?t=8301) in a way you know you become uh quite  
[2:18:25](https://youtu.be/iyWFulQ7apg?t=8305) um binary and you just learn  
[2:18:29](https://youtu.be/iyWFulQ7apg?t=8309) a niche within a niche and you forget  
[2:18:30](https://youtu.be/iyWFulQ7apg?t=8310) the bigger picture  
[2:18:32](https://youtu.be/iyWFulQ7apg?t=8312) which is why some of the great people in  
[2:18:35](https://youtu.be/iyWFulQ7apg?t=8315) the field  
[2:18:36](https://youtu.be/iyWFulQ7apg?t=8316) they actually have crossed over from  
[2:18:37](https://youtu.be/iyWFulQ7apg?t=8317) other fields like for example one of the  
[2:18:39](https://youtu.be/iyWFulQ7apg?t=8319) key movers and shakers  
[2:18:41](https://youtu.be/iyWFulQ7apg?t=8321) in um philosophy uh sorry in  
[2:18:44](https://youtu.be/iyWFulQ7apg?t=8324) evolutionary theory is james shapiro  
[2:18:48](https://youtu.be/iyWFulQ7apg?t=8328) who actually studied as his undergrad  
[2:18:50](https://youtu.be/iyWFulQ7apg?t=8330) english literature  
[2:18:52](https://youtu.be/iyWFulQ7apg?t=8332) nothing to do with biology but right now  
[2:18:54](https://youtu.be/iyWFulQ7apg?t=8334) he is right at the cutting edge  
[2:18:56](https://youtu.be/iyWFulQ7apg?t=8336) of an alternative to darwinism known as  
[2:18:58](https://youtu.be/iyWFulQ7apg?t=8338) natural genetic engineering  
[2:19:00](https://youtu.be/iyWFulQ7apg?t=8340) and he's recognized by academics and  
[2:19:02](https://youtu.be/iyWFulQ7apg?t=8342) he's referenced by academics  
[2:19:03](https://youtu.be/iyWFulQ7apg?t=8343) but again he just he's a polymath he  
[2:19:05](https://youtu.be/iyWFulQ7apg?t=8345) moved over  
[2:19:06](https://youtu.be/iyWFulQ7apg?t=8346) and i believe one of the reasons he's so  
[2:19:08](https://youtu.be/iyWFulQ7apg?t=8348) good is because he mastered  
[2:19:10](https://youtu.be/iyWFulQ7apg?t=8350) you know english literature then he went  
[2:19:12](https://youtu.be/iyWFulQ7apg?t=8352) into something totally different as  
[2:19:13](https://youtu.be/iyWFulQ7apg?t=8353) opposed to somebody  
[2:19:14](https://youtu.be/iyWFulQ7apg?t=8354) that was just you know going deeper and  
[2:19:17](https://youtu.be/iyWFulQ7apg?t=8357) deeper  
[2:19:18](https://youtu.be/iyWFulQ7apg?t=8358) in terms of niches right like chomsky  
[2:19:21](https://youtu.be/iyWFulQ7apg?t=8361) and  
[2:19:21](https://youtu.be/iyWFulQ7apg?t=8361) like yeah he's done really well with  
[2:19:23](https://youtu.be/iyWFulQ7apg?t=8363) linguistics and then he moved on to  
[2:19:25](https://youtu.be/iyWFulQ7apg?t=8365) everything else basically yeah do you  
[2:19:28](https://youtu.be/iyWFulQ7apg?t=8368) think a mixture of um videos and books  
[2:19:30](https://youtu.be/iyWFulQ7apg?t=8370) will be  
[2:19:31](https://youtu.be/iyWFulQ7apg?t=8371) good yeah use everything you can bro  
[2:19:33](https://youtu.be/iyWFulQ7apg?t=8373) like  
[2:19:34](https://youtu.be/iyWFulQ7apg?t=8374) you know some really like cutting edge  
[2:19:36](https://youtu.be/iyWFulQ7apg?t=8376) lectures  
[2:19:37](https://youtu.be/iyWFulQ7apg?t=8377) on youtube like for example there's one  
[2:19:39](https://youtu.be/iyWFulQ7apg?t=8379) about justice by michael sandell  
[2:19:41](https://youtu.be/iyWFulQ7apg?t=8381) i always recommend this on on youtube  
[2:19:43](https://youtu.be/iyWFulQ7apg?t=8383) it's like a 12 part series man  
[2:19:45](https://youtu.be/iyWFulQ7apg?t=8385) fantastic it's the best you're gonna

[2:19:52](https://youtu.be/iyWFulQ7apg?t=8392) liberal he wrote a book on  
[2:19:53](https://youtu.be/iyWFulQ7apg?t=8393) communitarianism right but he goes  
[2:19:55](https://youtu.be/iyWFulQ7apg?t=8395) through a lot of the political  
[2:19:57](https://youtu.be/iyWFulQ7apg?t=8397) philosophies a lot of the more  
[2:19:58](https://youtu.be/iyWFulQ7apg?t=8398) philosophies yeah and he's engaging with  
[2:19:59](https://youtu.be/iyWFulQ7apg?t=8399) the audience and  
[2:20:01](https://youtu.be/iyWFulQ7apg?t=8401) it's probably one of the most popular  
[2:20:02](https://youtu.be/iyWFulQ7apg?t=8402) lecture series online it's absolutely  
[2:20:04](https://youtu.be/iyWFulQ7apg?t=8404) like

[2:20:46](https://youtu.be/iyWFulQ7apg?t=8446) [Music]  
[2:20:55](https://youtu.be/iyWFulQ7apg?t=8455) [Music]  
[2:20:56](https://youtu.be/iyWFulQ7apg?t=8456) brothers  
[2:20:58](https://youtu.be/iyWFulQ7apg?t=8458) [Music]  
[2:21:01](https://youtu.be/iyWFulQ7apg?t=8461) that's my clone uh uh brother supporter  
[2:21:03](https://youtu.be/iyWFulQ7apg?t=8463) got a question for you brother i've been  
[2:21:04](https://youtu.be/iyWFulQ7apg?t=8464) uh following your work now for a little  
[2:21:06](https://youtu.be/iyWFulQ7apg?t=8466) bit and um admire what you do on on  
[2:21:08](https://youtu.be/iyWFulQ7apg?t=8468) evolution etc  
[2:21:10](https://youtu.be/iyWFulQ7apg?t=8470) um a question for you what are your  
[2:21:13](https://youtu.be/iyWFulQ7apg?t=8473) thoughts on earlier  
[2:21:14](https://youtu.be/iyWFulQ7apg?t=8474) uh islamic scholars like uh al jazeera's  
[2:21:17](https://youtu.be/iyWFulQ7apg?t=8477) and even  
[2:21:18](https://youtu.be/iyWFulQ7apg?t=8478) uh that wrote about evolution the  
[2:21:20](https://youtu.be/iyWFulQ7apg?t=8480) pre-date darwin so i know al-jaz has a  
[2:21:22](https://youtu.be/iyWFulQ7apg?t=8482) book called  
[2:21:24](https://youtu.be/iyWFulQ7apg?t=8484) and he deposits theories the uh  
[2:21:27](https://youtu.be/iyWFulQ7apg?t=8487) uh the discuss evolution what are your  
[2:21:29](https://youtu.be/iyWFulQ7apg?t=8489) what are your thoughts about these  
[2:21:30](https://youtu.be/iyWFulQ7apg?t=8490) that's a very very good question so this  
[2:21:33](https://youtu.be/iyWFulQ7apg?t=8493) is something in which  
[2:21:34](https://youtu.be/iyWFulQ7apg?t=8494) i made a huge mistake so  
[2:21:38](https://youtu.be/iyWFulQ7apg?t=8498) i believe the standard narrative which  
[2:21:40](https://youtu.be/iyWFulQ7apg?t=8500) has even been pushed out by  
[2:21:43](https://youtu.be/iyWFulQ7apg?t=8503) you know very prominent western  
[2:21:46](https://youtu.be/iyWFulQ7apg?t=8506) academics as well  
[2:21:47](https://youtu.be/iyWFulQ7apg?t=8507) that the muslims were way ahead of  
[2:21:49](https://youtu.be/iyWFulQ7apg?t=8509) everyone else when it comes to evolution  
[2:21:52](https://youtu.be/iyWFulQ7apg?t=8512) um so referencing like al-jahees  
[2:21:55](https://youtu.be/iyWFulQ7apg?t=8515) and others in fact there's a book i was  
[2:21:58](https://youtu.be/iyWFulQ7apg?t=8518) reading by  
[2:21:59](https://youtu.be/iyWFulQ7apg?t=8519) cambridge would you believe it a  
[2:22:00](https://youtu.be/iyWFulQ7apg?t=8520) cambridge professor  
[2:22:02](https://youtu.be/iyWFulQ7apg?t=8522) called darwin's ghost in which she was  
[2:22:04](https://youtu.be/iyWFulQ7apg?t=8524) repeating the same narrative  
[2:22:06](https://youtu.be/iyWFulQ7apg?t=8526) that allies and others you know they had  
[2:22:08](https://youtu.be/iyWFulQ7apg?t=8528) evolutionary ideas before darwin  
[2:22:10](https://youtu.be/iyWFulQ7apg?t=8530) hence darwin's ghosts however there was  
[2:22:14](https://youtu.be/iyWFulQ7apg?t=8534) a recent paper that was published and  
[2:22:16](https://youtu.be/iyWFulQ7apg?t=8536) this by the way is used by  
[2:22:19](https://youtu.be/iyWFulQ7apg?t=8539) some muslim uh evolutionists to say look  
[2:22:22](https://youtu.be/iyWFulQ7apg?t=8542) what's the deal they believed in it in  
[2:22:24](https://youtu.be/iyWFulQ7apg?t=8544) the past  
[2:22:25](https://youtu.be/iyWFulQ7apg?t=8545) we believe in it in fact we we even went  
[2:22:28](https://youtu.be/iyWFulQ7apg?t=8548) uh we even came  
[2:22:29](https://youtu.be/iyWFulQ7apg?t=8549) up with it before darwin now uh  
[2:22:32](https://youtu.be/iyWFulQ7apg?t=8552) professor shaib ahmed malik  
[2:22:35](https://youtu.be/iyWFulQ7apg?t=8555) somebody you'll you'll see on my channel  
[2:22:36](https://youtu.be/iyWFulQ7apg?t=8556) that we need delusions as well  
[2:22:38](https://youtu.be/iyWFulQ7apg?t=8558) he actually refuted this argument  
[2:22:41](https://youtu.be/iyWFulQ7apg?t=8561) in a way that it just completely  
[2:22:44](https://youtu.be/iyWFulQ7apg?t=8564) surprised academics i mean  
[2:22:46](https://youtu.be/iyWFulQ7apg?t=8566) not only like the cambridge academic are  
[2:22:48](https://youtu.be/iyWFulQ7apg?t=8568) speaking of but also some muslims who  
[2:22:50](https://youtu.be/iyWFulQ7apg?t=8570) wanted to  
[2:22:52](https://youtu.be/iyWFulQ7apg?t=8572) purely push the darwinian narrative  
[2:22:55](https://youtu.be/iyWFulQ7apg?t=8575) alongside the human chimpance history  
[2:22:57](https://youtu.be/iyWFulQ7apg?t=8577) and everything so he actually  
[2:22:59](https://youtu.be/iyWFulQ7apg?t=8579) showed how they the muslims didn't  
[2:23:03](https://youtu.be/iyWFulQ7apg?t=8583) actually have anything resembling  
[2:23:04](https://youtu.be/iyWFulQ7apg?t=8584) modern darwin theory and in fact  
[2:23:08](https://youtu.be/iyWFulQ7apg?t=8588) um it's been shoehorned into their  
[2:23:10](https://youtu.be/iyWFulQ7apg?t=8590) writing so  
[2:23:11](https://youtu.be/iyWFulQ7apg?t=8591) he looks into the works of al-jahees  
[2:23:13](https://youtu.be/iyWFulQ7apg?t=8593) there's actually an arab  
[2:23:16](https://youtu.be/iyWFulQ7apg?t=8596) professor who um  
[2:23:20](https://youtu.be/iyWFulQ7apg?t=8600) has written that book islam's quantum  
[2:23:22](https://youtu.be/iyWFulQ7apg?t=8602) question what's his name  
[2:23:24](https://youtu.be/iyWFulQ7apg?t=8604) uh well uh you know it's it's it's  
[2:23:27](https://youtu.be/iyWFulQ7apg?t=8607) yeah yeah please please look him up so  
[2:23:29](https://youtu.be/iyWFulQ7apg?t=8609) he was pushing this narrative as well  
[2:23:31](https://youtu.be/iyWFulQ7apg?t=8611) very famous on youtube as well um you  
[2:23:34](https://youtu.be/iyWFulQ7apg?t=8614) know  
[2:23:34](https://youtu.be/iyWFulQ7apg?t=8614) muslims discovered a muslim yeah  
[2:23:40](https://youtu.be/iyWFulQ7apg?t=8620) yeah and then so you know all of these  
[2:23:44](https://youtu.be/iyWFulQ7apg?t=8624) guys were  
[2:23:44](https://youtu.be/iyWFulQ7apg?t=8624) pushing this narrative and then you know  
[2:23:46](https://youtu.be/iyWFulQ7apg?t=8626) that paper  
[2:23:48](https://youtu.be/iyWFulQ7apg?t=8628) decisively showed there isn't an  
[2:23:50](https://youtu.be/iyWFulQ7apg?t=8630) argument there  
[2:23:51](https://youtu.be/iyWFulQ7apg?t=8631) so i highly recommend that paper um  
[2:23:54](https://youtu.be/iyWFulQ7apg?t=8634) mention the name and the author again  
[2:23:56](https://youtu.be/iyWFulQ7apg?t=8636) the author is professor schweib ahmed  
[2:23:58](https://youtu.be/iyWFulQ7apg?t=8638) malik  
[2:24:05](https://youtu.be/iyWFulQ7apg?t=8645) okay and the paper refutes the arguments  
[2:24:09](https://youtu.be/iyWFulQ7apg?t=8649) that muslims came up with darwinism and  
[2:24:12](https://youtu.be/iyWFulQ7apg?t=8652) hence  
[2:24:13](https://youtu.be/iyWFulQ7apg?t=8653) refutes the muslim evolutionists today  
[2:24:16](https://youtu.be/iyWFulQ7apg?t=8656) who simply want to accept  
[2:24:18](https://youtu.be/iyWFulQ7apg?t=8658) so so you'll be saying that the the uh  
[2:24:20](https://youtu.be/iyWFulQ7apg?t=8660) is it's an anachronism they they read  
[2:24:23](https://youtu.be/iyWFulQ7apg?t=8663) into  
[2:24:23](https://youtu.be/iyWFulQ7apg?t=8663) the israeli police with the lands of  
[2:24:25](https://youtu.be/iyWFulQ7apg?t=8665) darwin yep exactly  
[2:24:39](https://youtu.be/iyWFulQ7apg?t=8679) i said i did not know about that i  
[2:24:41](https://youtu.be/iyWFulQ7apg?t=8681) always was kind of under that impression  
[2:24:43](https://youtu.be/iyWFulQ7apg?t=8683) that they  
[2:24:43](https://youtu.be/iyWFulQ7apg?t=8683) they resembled dartmouth in fact  
[2:24:46](https://youtu.be/iyWFulQ7apg?t=8686) in fact i repeated it um  
[2:24:49](https://youtu.be/iyWFulQ7apg?t=8689) and i believed it to be true i mean i  
[2:24:51](https://youtu.be/iyWFulQ7apg?t=8691) was surprised  
[2:24:53](https://youtu.be/iyWFulQ7apg?t=8693) that you know once i found out what shui  
[2:24:56](https://youtu.be/iyWFulQ7apg?t=8696) uh had published and it  
[2:24:57](https://youtu.be/iyWFulQ7apg?t=8697) had been peer reviewed and it's come out  
[2:24:58](https://youtu.be/iyWFulQ7apg?t=8698) in a journal i was surprised that you  
[2:25:01](https://youtu.be/iyWFulQ7apg?t=8701) know  
[2:25:02](https://youtu.be/iyWFulQ7apg?t=8702) cambridge university professors  
[2:25:04](https://youtu.be/iyWFulQ7apg?t=8704) nonetheless  
[2:25:06](https://youtu.be/iyWFulQ7apg?t=8706) i mean no less get this wrong right so  
[2:25:09](https://youtu.be/iyWFulQ7apg?t=8709) i mean it's it's when schweib actually  
[2:25:11](https://youtu.be/iyWFulQ7apg?t=8711) showed me what was going on  
[2:25:13](https://youtu.be/iyWFulQ7apg?t=8713) it was literally a case of cherry  
[2:25:16](https://youtu.be/iyWFulQ7apg?t=8716) picking  
[2:25:16](https://youtu.be/iyWFulQ7apg?t=8716) right which someone had done in the past  
[2:25:18](https://youtu.be/iyWFulQ7apg?t=8718) and published  
[2:25:20](https://youtu.be/iyWFulQ7apg?t=8720) and nobody in academia bothered to  
[2:25:21](https://youtu.be/iyWFulQ7apg?t=8721) actually go and  
[2:25:23](https://youtu.be/iyWFulQ7apg?t=8723) check the translations and see if they  
[2:25:25](https://youtu.be/iyWFulQ7apg?t=8725) were done properly which again  
[2:25:26](https://youtu.be/iyWFulQ7apg?t=8726) you know a lot of academia is just based  
[2:25:28](https://youtu.be/iyWFulQ7apg?t=8728) on testimony so  
[2:25:30](https://youtu.be/iyWFulQ7apg?t=8730) you know some arab guys done it we trust  
[2:25:33](https://youtu.be/iyWFulQ7apg?t=8733) him everyone copies copies copies  
[2:25:35](https://youtu.be/iyWFulQ7apg?t=8735) and trade actually went and looked at  
[2:25:36](https://youtu.be/iyWFulQ7apg?t=8736) the source manuscripts and saw  
[2:25:39](https://youtu.be/iyWFulQ7apg?t=8739) it's not the case at all i'll read it  
[2:25:41](https://youtu.be/iyWFulQ7apg?t=8741) just that question collaborative  
[2:25:42](https://youtu.be/iyWFulQ7apg?t=8742) manuscripts with the with the  
[2:25:44](https://youtu.be/iyWFulQ7apg?t=8744) pictures on them and so on is that what  
[2:25:46](https://youtu.be/iyWFulQ7apg?t=8746) i'm talking about have you seen those  
[2:25:47](https://youtu.be/iyWFulQ7apg?t=8747) manuscripts  
[2:25:48](https://youtu.be/iyWFulQ7apg?t=8748) where the jaw heads ones i've i've  
[2:25:51](https://youtu.be/iyWFulQ7apg?t=8751) i haven't looked into what you've just  
[2:25:53](https://youtu.be/iyWFulQ7apg?t=8753) said that i said oh oh oh oh oh  
[2:25:55](https://youtu.be/iyWFulQ7apg?t=8755) his book of uh animals yeah yeah no no  
[2:25:58](https://youtu.be/iyWFulQ7apg?t=8758) that's all valid  
[2:26:00](https://youtu.be/iyWFulQ7apg?t=8760) but the idea that he came up with right  
[2:26:02](https://youtu.be/iyWFulQ7apg?t=8762) right yeah yeah that's good  
[2:26:03](https://youtu.be/iyWFulQ7apg?t=8763) but he he he has great contributions to  
[2:26:05](https://youtu.be/iyWFulQ7apg?t=8765) biology  
[2:26:10](https://youtu.be/iyWFulQ7apg?t=8770) 2.0  
[2:26:15](https://youtu.be/iyWFulQ7apg?t=8775) i just had a quick question um of my  
[2:26:18](https://youtu.be/iyWFulQ7apg?t=8778) university course i have to like deal  
[2:26:20](https://youtu.be/iyWFulQ7apg?t=8780) with cadavers yeah so you know like the  
[2:26:22](https://youtu.be/iyWFulQ7apg?t=8782) dead body so like  
[2:26:23](https://youtu.be/iyWFulQ7apg?t=8783) just looking at it it's maybe anatomy um  
[2:26:26](https://youtu.be/iyWFulQ7apg?t=8786) and i just had a question about um you  
[2:26:28](https://youtu.be/iyWFulQ7apg?t=8788) know i'm not sure what the actual view  
[2:26:30](https://youtu.be/iyWFulQ7apg?t=8790) is but you know for the and  
[2:26:31](https://youtu.be/iyWFulQ7apg?t=8791) the master sorry salem what actually  
[2:26:33](https://youtu.be/iyWFulQ7apg?t=8793) happens in the grave are they alive are  
[2:26:35](https://youtu.be/iyWFulQ7apg?t=8795) they like  
[2:26:36](https://youtu.be/iyWFulQ7apg?t=8796) are they preserved i just heard you i've  
[2:26:37](https://youtu.be/iyWFulQ7apg?t=8797) had a lot of things so like  
[2:26:39](https://youtu.be/iyWFulQ7apg?t=8799) what is the actual like always solid  
[2:26:42](https://youtu.be/iyWFulQ7apg?t=8802) yeah we don't believe that they they  
[2:26:44](https://youtu.be/iyWFulQ7apg?t=8804) they decompose we believe that they say  
[2:26:46](https://youtu.be/iyWFulQ7apg?t=8806) in their  
[2:26:47](https://youtu.be/iyWFulQ7apg?t=8807) original form they're incorruptable  
[2:26:50](https://youtu.be/iyWFulQ7apg?t=8810) in this assembly yeah but the belief is  
[2:26:52](https://youtu.be/iyWFulQ7apg?t=8812) that we  
[2:26:53](https://youtu.be/iyWFulQ7apg?t=8813) we we don't believe they are alive  
[2:26:57](https://youtu.be/iyWFulQ7apg?t=8817) we believe all all human beings pass  
[2:27:00](https://youtu.be/iyWFulQ7apg?t=8820) away  
[2:27:00](https://youtu.be/iyWFulQ7apg?t=8820) but the bodies of uh prophets are not  
[2:27:04](https://youtu.be/iyWFulQ7apg?t=8824) um decomposed decomposed in fact i mean  
[2:27:07](https://youtu.be/iyWFulQ7apg?t=8827) uh  
[2:27:08](https://youtu.be/iyWFulQ7apg?t=8828) maybe hijab's gonna refute me on this  
[2:27:09](https://youtu.be/iyWFulQ7apg?t=8829) but from my understanding this is also  
[2:27:11](https://youtu.be/iyWFulQ7apg?t=8831) true of  
[2:27:12](https://youtu.be/iyWFulQ7apg?t=8832) the companions that the companions  
[2:27:16](https://youtu.be/iyWFulQ7apg?t=8836) uh uh that we have uh uh  
[2:27:19](https://youtu.be/iyWFulQ7apg?t=8839) narrations about one of the for example  
[2:27:22](https://youtu.be/iyWFulQ7apg?t=8842) companions who passed away  
[2:27:24](https://youtu.be/iyWFulQ7apg?t=8844) um on his uh on his journey to  
[2:27:28](https://youtu.be/iyWFulQ7apg?t=8848) cyprus and that companion's body did not  
[2:27:31](https://youtu.be/iyWFulQ7apg?t=8851) and  
[2:27:31](https://youtu.be/iyWFulQ7apg?t=8851) he he died uh on on the ship  
[2:27:34](https://youtu.be/iyWFulQ7apg?t=8854) and his body did not decompose and we  
[2:27:37](https://youtu.be/iyWFulQ7apg?t=8857) likewise have other  
[2:27:38](https://youtu.be/iyWFulQ7apg?t=8858) stories of other companions who i mean  
[2:27:41](https://youtu.be/iyWFulQ7apg?t=8861) again these are these are not what the  
[2:27:42](https://youtu.be/iyWFulQ7apg?t=8862) prophet said this is not what allah said  
[2:27:44](https://youtu.be/iyWFulQ7apg?t=8864) these are things which came later which  
[2:27:46](https://youtu.be/iyWFulQ7apg?t=8866) people said this is also true for some  
[2:27:47](https://youtu.be/iyWFulQ7apg?t=8867) of the sahaba  
[2:27:48](https://youtu.be/iyWFulQ7apg?t=8868) allah knows best by the way you know  
[2:27:50](https://youtu.be/iyWFulQ7apg?t=8870) like nowadays catholic church has  
[2:27:52](https://youtu.be/iyWFulQ7apg?t=8872) a big scandal uh because they're trying  
[2:27:54](https://youtu.be/iyWFulQ7apg?t=8874) to say that all their saints are not  
[2:27:55](https://youtu.be/iyWFulQ7apg?t=8875) decomposed  
[2:27:56](https://youtu.be/iyWFulQ7apg?t=8876) right but most of these so-called  
[2:27:59](https://youtu.be/iyWFulQ7apg?t=8879) non-decomposed bodies are all like  
[2:28:01](https://youtu.be/iyWFulQ7apg?t=8881) they put these like whites or whatever  
[2:28:03](https://youtu.be/iyWFulQ7apg?t=8883) they're embalming yeah yeah  
[2:28:05](https://youtu.be/iyWFulQ7apg?t=8885) like what they've done with vladimir  
[2:28:07](https://youtu.be/iyWFulQ7apg?t=8887) lenin and in russia  
[2:28:09](https://youtu.be/iyWFulQ7apg?t=8889) i don't think he was the same but  
[2:28:11](https://youtu.be/iyWFulQ7apg?t=8891) basically yeah this embalming uh  
[2:28:12](https://youtu.be/iyWFulQ7apg?t=8892) thing i actually thought he was loving  
[2:28:14](https://youtu.be/iyWFulQ7apg?t=8894) us  
[2:28:19](https://youtu.be/iyWFulQ7apg?t=8899) so just kick him out of there check him  
[2:28:21](https://youtu.be/iyWFulQ7apg?t=8901) out  
[2:28:23](https://youtu.be/iyWFulQ7apg?t=8903) uh but yeah yeah so um we don't believe  
[2:28:26](https://youtu.be/iyWFulQ7apg?t=8906) that but in terms of the prophecy and  
[2:28:27](https://youtu.be/iyWFulQ7apg?t=8907) that's one of the miracles of the  
[2:28:28](https://youtu.be/iyWFulQ7apg?t=8908) prophet yeah they they  
[2:28:30](https://youtu.be/iyWFulQ7apg?t=8910) live in the in the in the  
[2:28:33](https://youtu.be/iyWFulQ7apg?t=8913) in the in the bazaar obviously we don't  
[2:28:36](https://youtu.be/iyWFulQ7apg?t=8916) believe they die  
[2:28:37](https://youtu.be/iyWFulQ7apg?t=8917) in totality we believe that there is a  
[2:28:39](https://youtu.be/iyWFulQ7apg?t=8919) human death  
[2:28:40](https://youtu.be/iyWFulQ7apg?t=8920) but then they continue living in uh in  
[2:28:42](https://youtu.be/iyWFulQ7apg?t=8922) another sense which is the bazaar which  
[2:28:43](https://youtu.be/iyWFulQ7apg?t=8923) is  
[2:28:44](https://youtu.be/iyWFulQ7apg?t=8924) what happens with everyone obviously you  
[2:28:45](https://youtu.be/iyWFulQ7apg?t=8925) should have that as well continue living  
[2:28:47](https://youtu.be/iyWFulQ7apg?t=8927) like life as well  
[2:28:50](https://youtu.be/iyWFulQ7apg?t=8930) brother youth may is allah  
[2:28:54](https://youtu.be/iyWFulQ7apg?t=8934) i think i kind of answered i was just  
[2:28:56](https://youtu.be/iyWFulQ7apg?t=8936) thinking about like a scenario  
[2:28:57](https://youtu.be/iyWFulQ7apg?t=8937) um i think it's just a rewarding  
[2:28:59](https://youtu.be/iyWFulQ7apg?t=8939) essentially of like a circle argument  
[2:29:01](https://youtu.be/iyWFulQ7apg?t=8941) but like  
[2:29:02](https://youtu.be/iyWFulQ7apg?t=8942) you know when we like measured okay  
[2:29:04](https://youtu.be/iyWFulQ7apg?t=8944) let's say i have a laptop here and it  
[2:29:06](https://youtu.be/iyWFulQ7apg?t=8946) measures 20 centimeters  
[2:29:08](https://youtu.be/iyWFulQ7apg?t=8948) um there's an infinite amount of um  
[2:29:11](https://youtu.be/iyWFulQ7apg?t=8951) degree of like let's say i have two two  
[2:29:14](https://youtu.be/iyWFulQ7apg?t=8954) uh windows laptops are exactly the same  
[2:29:15](https://youtu.be/iyWFulQ7apg?t=8955) right  
[2:29:16](https://youtu.be/iyWFulQ7apg?t=8956) but if i measure but one length the side  
[2:29:18](https://youtu.be/iyWFulQ7apg?t=8958) the same side on both  
[2:29:20](https://youtu.be/iyWFulQ7apg?t=8960) um there's going to be a degree of  
[2:29:22](https://youtu.be/iyWFulQ7apg?t=8962) difference essentially right because  
[2:29:25](https://youtu.be/iyWFulQ7apg?t=8965) do you get like i'm not sure how to  
[2:29:27](https://youtu.be/iyWFulQ7apg?t=8967) describe it but like let's say one is  
[2:29:28](https://youtu.be/iyWFulQ7apg?t=8968) 10.1 centimeters and the other one's  
[2:29:30](https://youtu.be/iyWFulQ7apg?t=8970) 10.1  
[2:29:31](https://youtu.be/iyWFulQ7apg?t=8971) but if i take that to 10 more decimal  
[2:29:32](https://youtu.be/iyWFulQ7apg?t=8972) places  
[2:29:35](https://youtu.be/iyWFulQ7apg?t=8975) or um or something it's going to be  
[2:29:36](https://youtu.be/iyWFulQ7apg?t=8976) different whenever at some point it's  
[2:29:38](https://youtu.be/iyWFulQ7apg?t=8978) going to be different along those lines  
[2:29:39](https://youtu.be/iyWFulQ7apg?t=8979) right  
[2:29:40](https://youtu.be/iyWFulQ7apg?t=8980) sorry i don't i don't understand the  
[2:29:43](https://youtu.be/iyWFulQ7apg?t=8983) context okay  
[2:29:44](https://youtu.be/iyWFulQ7apg?t=8984) let me let me try and rephrase it so  
[2:29:45](https://youtu.be/iyWFulQ7apg?t=8985) like let's say i have two two  
[2:29:47](https://youtu.be/iyWFulQ7apg?t=8987) objects that are meant to be exactly the  
[2:29:48](https://youtu.be/iyWFulQ7apg?t=8988) same right  
[2:29:50](https://youtu.be/iyWFulQ7apg?t=8990) yeah yeah and then i take the same um  
[2:29:53](https://youtu.be/iyWFulQ7apg?t=8993) length  
[2:29:53](https://youtu.be/iyWFulQ7apg?t=8993) on both objects at some point along the  
[2:29:56](https://youtu.be/iyWFulQ7apg?t=8996) decimal place um scale they will differ  
[2:29:59](https://youtu.be/iyWFulQ7apg?t=8999) right  
[2:30:01](https://youtu.be/iyWFulQ7apg?t=9001) why because they can't be exactly it's  
[2:30:03](https://youtu.be/iyWFulQ7apg?t=9003) not possible for like well  
[2:30:04](https://youtu.be/iyWFulQ7apg?t=9004) that's this is where the question comes  
[2:30:05](https://youtu.be/iyWFulQ7apg?t=9005) in really is it like  
[2:30:07](https://youtu.be/iyWFulQ7apg?t=9007) mathematically speaking is it not is it  
[2:30:09](https://youtu.be/iyWFulQ7apg?t=9009) almost like impossible for something to  
[2:30:11](https://youtu.be/iyWFulQ7apg?t=9011) be exactly the same in terms of  
[2:30:12](https://youtu.be/iyWFulQ7apg?t=9012) measurement  
[2:30:12](https://youtu.be/iyWFulQ7apg?t=9012) because at some point like let's say i  
[2:30:14](https://youtu.be/iyWFulQ7apg?t=9014) go to the millionth decimal place won't  
[2:30:16](https://youtu.be/iyWFulQ7apg?t=9016) it vary  
[2:30:17](https://youtu.be/iyWFulQ7apg?t=9017) no why why why would it i mean in terms  
[2:30:21](https://youtu.be/iyWFulQ7apg?t=9021) of like because  
[2:30:22](https://youtu.be/iyWFulQ7apg?t=9022) no particle the arrangement of particles  
[2:30:24](https://youtu.be/iyWFulQ7apg?t=9024) can't be exactly the same because  
[2:30:25](https://youtu.be/iyWFulQ7apg?t=9025) apostle can't like take the same like  
[2:30:27](https://youtu.be/iyWFulQ7apg?t=9027) positioning  
[2:30:29](https://youtu.be/iyWFulQ7apg?t=9029) yeah but you said it's the same in the  
[2:30:31](https://youtu.be/iyWFulQ7apg?t=9031) beginning no  
[2:30:32](https://youtu.be/iyWFulQ7apg?t=9032) i mean in terms of like human  
[2:30:34](https://youtu.be/iyWFulQ7apg?t=9034) manufacturing  
[2:30:37](https://youtu.be/iyWFulQ7apg?t=9037) the question hasn't really come out  
[2:30:39](https://youtu.be/iyWFulQ7apg?t=9039) right right okay you're not saying  
[2:30:40](https://youtu.be/iyWFulQ7apg?t=9040) hypothetically you're saying yeah okay i  
[2:30:42](https://youtu.be/iyWFulQ7apg?t=9042) get it in real terms yeah in real terms  
[2:30:44](https://youtu.be/iyWFulQ7apg?t=9044) so we make two different dolls yup yeah  
[2:30:46](https://youtu.be/iyWFulQ7apg?t=9046) yeah yeah yeah  
[2:30:47](https://youtu.be/iyWFulQ7apg?t=9047) yeah um yes i was just thinking um  
[2:30:50](https://youtu.be/iyWFulQ7apg?t=9050) is is it like if you were to say like  
[2:30:52](https://youtu.be/iyWFulQ7apg?t=9052) using that logic then would you say if  
[2:30:55](https://youtu.be/iyWFulQ7apg?t=9055) a loss fan followers make something to  
[2:30:56](https://youtu.be/iyWFulQ7apg?t=9056) exactly the same objects  
[2:30:58](https://youtu.be/iyWFulQ7apg?t=9058) um and we take the same measurement on  
[2:31:00](https://youtu.be/iyWFulQ7apg?t=9060) both  
[2:31:01](https://youtu.be/iyWFulQ7apg?t=9061) are they not going to be the same the  
[2:31:04](https://youtu.be/iyWFulQ7apg?t=9064) thing is allah is the best of creators i  
[2:31:06](https://youtu.be/iyWFulQ7apg?t=9066) mean that  
[2:31:07](https://youtu.be/iyWFulQ7apg?t=9067) that's just human imperfection why  
[2:31:10](https://youtu.be/iyWFulQ7apg?t=9070) things would be different but with allah  
[2:31:12](https://youtu.be/iyWFulQ7apg?t=9072) it'd be the exact same  
[2:31:15](https://youtu.be/iyWFulQ7apg?t=9075) yeah okay yeah yeah uh yeah i think it's  
[2:31:17](https://youtu.be/iyWFulQ7apg?t=9077) just almost like yeah  
[2:31:18](https://youtu.be/iyWFulQ7apg?t=9078) i was just concerned you're talking  
[2:31:21](https://youtu.be/iyWFulQ7apg?t=9081) maybe about the measurement problem  
[2:31:23](https://youtu.be/iyWFulQ7apg?t=9083) yes our ability to or lack  
[2:31:26](https://youtu.be/iyWFulQ7apg?t=9086) thereof to measure something is  
[2:31:29](https://youtu.be/iyWFulQ7apg?t=9089) different from  
[2:31:29](https://youtu.be/iyWFulQ7apg?t=9089) the fact that the ontological reality of  
[2:31:32](https://youtu.be/iyWFulQ7apg?t=9092) it being  
[2:31:33](https://youtu.be/iyWFulQ7apg?t=9093) actually the same or not so if we  
[2:31:36](https://youtu.be/iyWFulQ7apg?t=9096) measure something  
[2:31:37](https://youtu.be/iyWFulQ7apg?t=9097) maybe our measurements or instruments  
[2:31:39](https://youtu.be/iyWFulQ7apg?t=9099) are going to be problematic but the fact  
[2:31:41](https://youtu.be/iyWFulQ7apg?t=9101) that they're both the same can be  
[2:31:42](https://youtu.be/iyWFulQ7apg?t=9102) it's logically conceivable that you can  
[2:31:44](https://youtu.be/iyWFulQ7apg?t=9104) have something the same height and the  
[2:31:45](https://youtu.be/iyWFulQ7apg?t=9105) same size  
[2:31:46](https://youtu.be/iyWFulQ7apg?t=9106) i can create like yeah so jazakallah  
[2:31:49](https://youtu.be/iyWFulQ7apg?t=9109) brother yusuf  
[2:31:50](https://youtu.be/iyWFulQ7apg?t=9110) for your question what we're going to be

[2:32:27](https://youtu.be/iyWFulQ7apg?t=9147) yeah it's a shame but you can obviously  
[2:32:29](https://youtu.be/iyWFulQ7apg?t=9149) ask questions if you're  
[2:32:31](https://youtu.be/iyWFulQ7apg?t=9151) yeah you can write them down if you want  
[2:32:33](https://youtu.be/iyWFulQ7apg?t=9153) and so on but
