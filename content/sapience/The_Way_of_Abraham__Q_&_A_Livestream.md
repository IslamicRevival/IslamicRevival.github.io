**<a onclick="modifyYTiframeseektime('0')">00:00:00</a>** The Way of Abraham is a spiritual teaching that invites humanity to abandon any notions of a deity worthy of worship, and instead to focus all of their attention on Allah alone. The livestream discusses the Fitrah, the innate disposition that leads humans towards righteousness, and its connection to a purpose in life. There are two main opinions on the matter of Fitrah's knowledge, but both agree that it gets clouded over time.

* **<a onclick="modifyYTiframeseektime('300')">00:05:00</a>** Discusses how different approaches to unclouding the fitrah (mind/heart) differ based on the individual. He goes on to say that in order to truly understand the person, one must see them beyond their intellect and emotions. This can only be done by becoming more intellectually and spiritually mature.
* **<a onclick="modifyYTiframeseektime('600')">00:10:00</a>** Yusuf gives an overview of how to ask questions about spiritual topics, and recommends that people first understand the Qur'an and Sunnah.

* **<a onclick="modifyYTiframeseektime('900')">00:15:00</a>** Discusses the idea of gira, or protective jealousy, and how it can be a hindrance to women in the modern world. He asks Zach how he is doing, and Zach responds that he is very good and excited about the heavy hitters coming on board to ask questions. notes that not all is well, and that there is a need for gira to be removed from the equation so that women can be more liberated. He has a question for Zach, asking about the concept of gira and whether or not it is true that a woman can't have a job, be a teacher, or go outside without fearing for her safety.
* **<a onclick="modifyYTiframeseektime('1200')">00:20:00</a>** In this Q&A livestream, a sister asks a question about the way in which a woman should behave in order to be pleasing to her husband. She explains that while there is a general principle of positive jealousy in islamic tradition, it should not be used to oppress anyone. She also notes that many men in today's society do not have this type of positive jealousy, which is unfortunate.
* **<a onclick="modifyYTiframeseektime('1500')">00:25:00</a>** Discusses the "red pill" movement, which encourages men not to marry divorced or single mothers. He says that this system of polygamy is beneficial towards women who have had a brutal divorce.
* **<a onclick="modifyYTiframeseektime('1800')">00:30:00</a>** Discusses how certain men who call themselves "Islamic reformers" are actually very weak and have no connection with Islam or Allah. These men claim that the prophet Muhammad, peace be upon him, was not a real man and that he was married to women who were not virgins. These men are counter to the life of the prophet and should be shunned.
* **<a onclick="modifyYTiframeseektime('2100')">00:35:00</a>** Discusses the importance of having a strong connection with Allah, and how one's state of being affects one's relationships and overall spiritual well-being.

They explain that while vegans may have a valid philosophical basis for their beliefs, the underlying impulse is to reject Islam as a whole. urges Muslims to be nuanced in their discussion of animal sacrifice, noting that there is an ethical dimension to the tradition.
* **<a onclick="modifyYTiframeseektime('2700')">00:45:00</a>** This Muslim discusses the fact that animals are Muslim, and that they can be eaten in accordance to Islamic law. He then asks a question about the validity of veganism, as it is based on reasoning that may be flawed. He concludes by stating that while reason can be a basis for determining truth, there is always the risk of our reasoning being imperfect.
* **<a onclick="modifyYTiframeseektime('3000')">00:50:00</a>** The way of Abraham is a means to establish the truth, and different means can lead to the truth. For example, sound reasoning can lead to the truth, but the heart may have the spiritual disease of arrogance which would block the function of the heart, preventing the person from realizing the truth.
* **<a onclick="modifyYTiframeseektime('3300')">00:55:00</a>** Discusses the idea that all human beings are born with a fitra, or innate ability to recognize God.

**<a onclick="modifyYTiframeseektime('3600')">01:00:00</a>** Discusses how he grew up thinking that science and religion were incompatible, and how he came to understand that science can be used to understand the truth of the physical world. He then goes on to say that there is a problem when people take science for granted and think that anything that contradicts religion must be false.

* **<a onclick="modifyYTiframeseektime('3900')">01:05:00</a>** Atheism cannot be assumed into one's scientific understanding of the world. If a well-confirmed scientific theory contradicts Islam, then the adherent to Islam accepts what islam says over the scientific theory.
* **<a onclick="modifyYTiframeseektime('4200')">01:10:00</a>** explains that allah is the most merciful and forgiving, and that his forgiveness is to the highest degree possible. also discusses how to understand allah's names and attributes, and how they are to the highest degree possible without any deficiency.

Allah is the most powerful, rich, and independent, and does not require anything from us.
* **<a onclick="modifyYTiframeseektime('4500')">01:15:00</a>** The way of Abraham is a practical way of life that stresses the importance of forgiveness. Allah does not require anything from us, but he loves us infinitely and perfectly. His love is independent and pure, without any deficiency or flaw. The greatest manifestation of love in the dunya is a mother's love, which is nothing compared to the love of Allah. Hell is a reality, but it is also an opportunity for repentance and guidance from Allah.
* **<a onclick="modifyYTiframeseektime('4800')">01:20:00</a>** Discusses two scenarios in which a person can be forgiven: the king of the castle example and the Sarah example. The king of the castle example is more in line with maximal forgiveness, while the Sarah example is more in line with the Quranic concept of allahu akbar. makes reference to a verse from the Quran and a hadith to illustrate this point. In both scenarios, all that is necessary for forgiveness is for the person to turn to Allah and ask for forgiveness.
* **<a onclick="modifyYTiframeseektime('5100')">01:25:00</a>**  Ustad Hamza discusses the concept of mercy with a skeptic. He points out that mercy is not just a act of kindness, but an example of a non-maximal mercy. He also argues that justice must play a role in determining whether someone goes to hell, as people must choose to reject Allah in order to go there.
* **<a onclick="modifyYTiframeseektime('5400')">01:30:00</a>** Discusses how patience is a key virtue in Islam, and how it is necessary for success. He also points out that patience is important for dealing with difficult situations.

<a onclick="modifyYTiframeseektime('248')">0:04:08</a> and the acknowledgment is based on  
<a onclick="modifyYTiframeseektime('251')">0:04:11</a> something called  
<a onclick="modifyYTiframeseektime('252')">0:04:12</a> the fitra we have an innate disposition

<a onclick="modifyYTiframeseektime('264')">0:04:24</a> and there are two main opinions in our  
<a onclick="modifyYTiframeseektime('266')">0:04:26</a> tradition that the fitra has some  
<a onclick="modifyYTiframeseektime('268')">0:04:28</a> knowledge  
<a onclick="modifyYTiframeseektime('268')">0:04:28</a> that has a form of proton knowledge or  
<a onclick="modifyYTiframeseektime('270')">0:04:30</a> primary knowledge and the other opinion  
<a onclick="modifyYTiframeseektime('272')">0:04:32</a> is that he has no knowledge  
<a onclick="modifyYTiframeseektime('274')">0:04:34</a> but what's similar between these two  
<a onclick="modifyYTiframeseektime('275')">0:04:35</a> opinions is that the fitra from a  
<a onclick="modifyYTiframeseektime('276')">0:04:36</a> metaphorical point of view gets clouded  
<a onclick="modifyYTiframeseektime('279')">0:04:39</a> right it gets clouded and it gets  
<a onclick="modifyYTiframeseektime('281')">0:04:41</a> clouded for different reasons and we

<a onclick="modifyYTiframeseektime('744')">0:12:24</a> easier  
<a onclick="modifyYTiframeseektime('745')">0:12:25</a> but for the time being we're just going  
<a onclick="modifyYTiframeseektime('746')">0:12:26</a> to post it there so if you want to jump

<a onclick="modifyYTiframeseektime('753')">0:12:33</a> and we'll see what i go on uh let's have  
<a onclick="modifyYTiframeseektime('757')">0:12:37</a> a look  
<a onclick="modifyYTiframeseektime('758')">0:12:38</a> so if someone says that they don't feel  
<a onclick="modifyYTiframeseektime('761')">0:12:41</a> the need  
<a onclick="modifyYTiframeseektime('761')">0:12:41</a> to bother about how the world was  
<a onclick="modifyYTiframeseektime('764')">0:12:44</a> created what's going on with them  
<a onclick="modifyYTiframeseektime('767')">0:12:47</a> that's a local question what's going on  
<a onclick="modifyYTiframeseektime('769')">0:12:49</a> with them  
<a onclick="modifyYTiframeseektime('770')">0:12:50</a> yeah okay so i'll give you my ten pence  
<a onclick="modifyYTiframeseektime('772')">0:12:52</a> you give your tempers inshaallah so  
<a onclick="modifyYTiframeseektime('774')">0:12:54</a> bismillah my dear brother first and  
<a onclick="modifyYTiframeseektime('775')">0:12:55</a> foremost is coming on board  
<a onclick="modifyYTiframeseektime('778')">0:12:58</a> for being brave enough to ask a question  
<a onclick="modifyYTiframeseektime('779')">0:12:59</a> publicly i know many people say that  
<a onclick="modifyYTiframeseektime('781')">0:13:01</a> public appearances are speaking  
<a onclick="modifyYTiframeseektime('783')">0:13:03</a> they they fear that more than death so  
<a onclick="modifyYTiframeseektime('785')">0:13:05</a> by virtue of you asking a question you  
<a onclick="modifyYTiframeseektime('787')">0:13:07</a> have overcome death  
<a onclick="modifyYTiframeseektime('788')">0:13:08</a> to some degree so just right here for  
<a onclick="modifyYTiframeseektime('790')">0:13:10</a> that now so if someone asks  
<a onclick="modifyYTiframeseektime('792')">0:13:12</a> you know they don't feel the need or not  
<a onclick="modifyYTiframeseektime('793')">0:13:13</a> bothered so they have this kind of  
<a onclick="modifyYTiframeseektime('795')">0:13:15</a> nihilistic approach  
<a onclick="modifyYTiframeseektime('796')">0:13:16</a> which yusuf is an expert on but what i  
<a onclick="modifyYTiframeseektime('798')">0:13:18</a> would say from this perspective  
<a onclick="modifyYTiframeseektime('800')">0:13:20</a> you have to first and foremost  
<a onclick="modifyYTiframeseektime('801')">0:13:21</a> understand the caveat the  
<a onclick="modifyYTiframeseektime('803')">0:13:23</a> sunnah of dao with individuals to  
<a onclick="modifyYTiframeseektime('805')">0:13:25</a> understand the context so i don't really  
<a onclick="modifyYTiframeseektime('806')">0:13:26</a> know the person i don't know where  
<a onclick="modifyYTiframeseektime('807')">0:13:27</a> they're from their name their background  
<a onclick="modifyYTiframeseektime('809')">0:13:29</a> whatever the case may be  
<a onclick="modifyYTiframeseektime('810')">0:13:30</a> so my answer is going to be an  
<a onclick="modifyYTiframeseektime('811')">0:13:31</a> abstraction but usually with someone  
<a onclick="modifyYTiframeseektime('813')">0:13:33</a> like this  
<a onclick="modifyYTiframeseektime('814')">0:13:34</a> you have to create that need and the way  
<a onclick="modifyYTiframeseektime('816')">0:13:36</a> to create that need is not one with  
<a onclick="modifyYTiframeseektime('818')">0:13:38</a> thought experiments  
<a onclick="modifyYTiframeseektime('819')">0:13:39</a> or actually getting them to stand in the  
<a onclick="modifyYTiframeseektime('821')">0:13:41</a> possibility that not being bothered  
<a onclick="modifyYTiframeseektime('823')">0:13:43</a> about their existence not being  
<a onclick="modifyYTiframeseektime('824')">0:13:44</a> bothered about their life can have  
<a onclick="modifyYTiframeseektime('826')">0:13:46</a> severe consequences  
<a onclick="modifyYTiframeseektime('828')">0:13:48</a> and this is where the quranic dawah  
<a onclick="modifyYTiframeseektime('829')">0:13:49</a> comes in when you talk about janna and  
<a onclick="modifyYTiframeseektime('831')">0:13:51</a> jahannam  
<a onclick="modifyYTiframeseektime('832')">0:13:52</a> right you told them well you are you can  
<a onclick="modifyYTiframeseektime('834')">0:13:54</a> be eligible for paradise eternal bliss  
<a onclick="modifyYTiframeseektime('836')">0:13:56</a> or you could be eligible for  
<a onclick="modifyYTiframeseektime('838')">0:13:58</a> your own self-domination because the  
<a onclick="modifyYTiframeseektime('839')">0:13:59</a> kind of concept of hell and the islamic  
<a onclick="modifyYTiframeseektime('841')">0:14:01</a> tradition is that you threw yourself  
<a onclick="modifyYTiframeseektime('843')">0:14:03</a> into hell because allah subhanahu wa  
<a onclick="modifyYTiframeseektime('845')">0:14:05</a> says in the quran that he doesn't prefer  
<a onclick="modifyYTiframeseektime('846')">0:14:06</a> disbelief for his servants  
<a onclick="modifyYTiframeseektime('848')">0:14:08</a> what do they say the classical say that  
<a onclick="modifyYTiframeseektime('851')">0:14:11</a> allah doesn't want people to go to hell  
<a onclick="modifyYTiframeseektime('852')">0:14:12</a> we close the door to allah's guidance  
<a onclick="modifyYTiframeseektime('854')">0:14:14</a> and mercy when it was already open but  
<a onclick="modifyYTiframeseektime('856')">0:14:16</a> we closed it  
<a onclick="modifyYTiframeseektime('857')">0:14:17</a> and when the only door that's opened is  
<a onclick="modifyYTiframeseektime('859')">0:14:19</a> the door of hell and we've thrown  
<a onclick="modifyYTiframeseektime('860')">0:14:20</a> ourselves that's why allah says  
<a onclick="modifyYTiframeseektime('862')">0:14:22</a> allah did not wrong them they wronged  
<a onclick="modifyYTiframeseektime('864')">0:14:24</a> themselves so it's very important to  
<a onclick="modifyYTiframeseektime('866')">0:14:26</a> understand that it's not how can a  
<a onclick="modifyYTiframeseektime('867')">0:14:27</a> loving lord send you to hell  
<a onclick="modifyYTiframeseektime('868')">0:14:28</a> the right question is how can we choose  
<a onclick="modifyYTiframeseektime('871')">0:14:31</a> hell  
<a onclick="modifyYTiframeseektime('871')">0:14:31</a> over a loving lord so you have to show  
<a onclick="modifyYTiframeseektime('874')">0:14:34</a> them that this is  
<a onclick="modifyYTiframeseektime('875')">0:14:35</a> maybe the eligible for this and that  
<a onclick="modifyYTiframeseektime('876')">0:14:36</a> could create an awakening and say you  
<a onclick="modifyYTiframeseektime('877')">0:14:37</a> know what i need to take this a bit  
<a onclick="modifyYTiframeseektime('878')">0:14:38</a> seriously because the consequences  
<a onclick="modifyYTiframeseektime('880')">0:14:40</a> are eternal that's the first point the  
<a onclick="modifyYTiframeseektime('882')">0:14:42</a> second point is give them a thought  
<a onclick="modifyYTiframeseektime('883')">0:14:43</a> experiment say  
<a onclick="modifyYTiframeseektime('884')">0:14:44</a> well isn't this equivalent of you being  
<a onclick="modifyYTiframeseektime('886')">0:14:46</a> sedated then  
<a onclick="modifyYTiframeseektime('887')">0:14:47</a> thrown onto a plane and you wake up on  
<a onclick="modifyYTiframeseektime('890')">0:14:50</a> the plane you're in first class  
<a onclick="modifyYTiframeseektime('892')">0:14:52</a> and you have an amazing luxurious  
<a onclick="modifyYTiframeseektime('894')">0:14:54</a> comfortable experience a flatbed  
<a onclick="modifyYTiframeseektime('896')">0:14:56</a> that's designed to make you feel  
<a onclick="modifyYTiframeseektime('898')">0:14:58</a> comfortable you have food on tap  
<a onclick="modifyYTiframeseektime('899')">0:14:59</a> entertainment on tap  
<a onclick="modifyYTiframeseektime('901')">0:15:01</a> niches on tab music on top games on tap  
<a onclick="modifyYTiframeseektime('903')">0:15:03</a> movies on tap you have sunset sunrise  
<a onclick="modifyYTiframeseektime('906')">0:15:06</a> you have  
<a onclick="modifyYTiframeseektime('907')">0:15:07</a> you have snow top mountains you have the  
<a onclick="modifyYTiframeseektime('908')">0:15:08</a> words like wow this is paradisial  
<a onclick="modifyYTiframeseektime('911')">0:15:11</a> but then after are you gonna be in that  
<a onclick="modifyYTiframeseektime('913')">0:15:13</a> state surely you know after five minutes  
<a onclick="modifyYTiframeseektime('915')">0:15:15</a> you're gonna say hold on a second  
<a onclick="modifyYTiframeseektime('917')">0:15:17</a> how did i get here where did i come from  
<a onclick="modifyYTiframeseektime('920')">0:15:20</a> where is the plane headed to what am i  
<a onclick="modifyYTiframeseektime('923')">0:15:23</a> supposed to do  
<a onclick="modifyYTiframeseektime('924')">0:15:24</a> i don't even have my passport right so  
<a onclick="modifyYTiframeseektime('927')">0:15:27</a> it's very important brothers and sisters  
<a onclick="modifyYTiframeseektime('928')">0:15:28</a> to give these type of full experiments  
<a onclick="modifyYTiframeseektime('930')">0:15:30</a> and give the kind of the psycho  
<a onclick="modifyYTiframeseektime('931')">0:15:31</a> spiritual emotive  
<a onclick="modifyYTiframeseektime('933')">0:15:33</a> motivational right kind of quranic  
<a onclick="modifyYTiframeseektime('936')">0:15:36</a> paradigms that janna and jahannam to get  
<a onclick="modifyYTiframeseektime('939')">0:15:39</a> to think seriously about this matter  
<a onclick="modifyYTiframeseektime('941')">0:15:41</a> if you combine those two a thought  
<a onclick="modifyYTiframeseektime('942')">0:15:42</a> experiment that is real for them  
<a onclick="modifyYTiframeseektime('945')">0:15:45</a> and you combine the eligibility for  
<a onclick="modifyYTiframeseektime('947')">0:15:47</a> eternal bliss or the eligibility for  
<a onclick="modifyYTiframeseektime('949')">0:15:49</a> them  
<a onclick="modifyYTiframeseektime('950')">0:15:50</a> closing your door to god's mercy and  
<a onclick="modifyYTiframeseektime('952')">0:15:52</a> guidance that should do the trick  
<a onclick="modifyYTiframeseektime('954')">0:15:54</a> inshallah but you should do it within  
<a onclick="modifyYTiframeseektime('956')">0:15:56</a> the context of hikmah  
<a onclick="modifyYTiframeseektime('957')">0:15:57</a> within the context of wisdom you should  
<a onclick="modifyYTiframeseektime('959')">0:15:59</a> do in the context of rahmah  
<a onclick="modifyYTiframeseektime('960')">0:16:00</a> you should do in the context of being  
<a onclick="modifyYTiframeseektime('962')">0:16:02</a> merciful because remember when you're  
<a onclick="modifyYTiframeseektime('963')">0:16:03</a> engaged in the dawah or in anything in  
<a onclick="modifyYTiframeseektime('966')">0:16:06</a> life  
<a onclick="modifyYTiframeseektime('966')">0:16:06</a> you have to be committed to the goodness  
<a onclick="modifyYTiframeseektime('968')">0:16:08</a> and guidance of all people  
<a onclick="modifyYTiframeseektime('969')">0:16:09</a> we know this from the hadith of the  
<a onclick="modifyYTiframeseektime('971')">0:16:11</a> prophet sallallahu alaihi wasallam as  
<a onclick="modifyYTiframeseektime('973')">0:16:13</a> narrated by bukhari  
<a onclick="modifyYTiframeseektime('977')">0:16:17</a> and it's different from the hadith is  
<a onclick="modifyYTiframeseektime('979')">0:16:19</a> very similar but it's different it says  
<a onclick="modifyYTiframeseektime('980')">0:16:20</a> the love for  
<a onclick="modifyYTiframeseektime('981')">0:16:21</a> limnest love for humanity with love for  
<a onclick="modifyYTiframeseektime('983')">0:16:23</a> yourself and the hadith the 13th hadith  
<a onclick="modifyYTiframeseektime('990')">0:16:30</a> you won't truly believe unless you love  
<a onclick="modifyYTiframeseektime('991')">0:16:31</a> for your brother you love yourself this  
<a onclick="modifyYTiframeseektime('993')">0:16:33</a> also includes  
<a onclick="modifyYTiframeseektime('994')">0:16:34</a> brother in humanity and that's right and  
<a onclick="modifyYTiframeseektime('996')">0:16:36</a> now we said this includes insenia human  
<a onclick="modifyYTiframeseektime('998')">0:16:38</a> beings  
<a onclick="modifyYTiframeseektime('999')">0:16:39</a> and we also have to understand that it's  
<a onclick="modifyYTiframeseektime('1001')">0:16:41</a> not only and now he said this with the  
<a onclick="modifyYTiframeseektime('1003')">0:16:43</a> maliki scholar  
<a onclick="modifyYTiframeseektime('1005')">0:16:45</a> he said something similar so we have to  
<a onclick="modifyYTiframeseektime('1006')">0:16:46</a> be committed to the goodness and  
<a onclick="modifyYTiframeseektime('1008')">0:16:48</a> guidance of more people use themselves  
<a onclick="modifyYTiframeseektime('1010')">0:16:50</a> if we got some of those lights like  
<a onclick="modifyYTiframeseektime('1012')">0:16:52</a> special lights or something we're  
<a onclick="modifyYTiframeseektime('1014')">0:16:54</a> getting some decent light in there and  
<a onclick="modifyYTiframeseektime('1015')">0:16:55</a> muscle are you getting some uh serious  
<a onclick="modifyYTiframeseektime('1017')">0:16:57</a> energy well it's been an  
<a onclick="modifyYTiframeseektime('1019')">0:16:59</a> easy day so i'm in that state so i'm  
<a onclick="modifyYTiframeseektime('1021')">0:17:01</a> trying to keep that stage  
<a onclick="modifyYTiframeseektime('1023')">0:17:03</a> keep it going keep it going uh yeah so  
<a onclick="modifyYTiframeseektime('1024')">0:17:04</a> my two pence's um  
<a onclick="modifyYTiframeseektime('1026')">0:17:06</a> is really the question if someone says  
<a onclick="modifyYTiframeseektime('1027')">0:17:07</a> that they don't feel the need to bother  
<a onclick="modifyYTiframeseektime('1029')">0:17:09</a> about how the world was created what's  
<a onclick="modifyYTiframeseektime('1031')">0:17:11</a> going on with them  
<a onclick="modifyYTiframeseektime('1032')">0:17:12</a> yes sir what it is is i think there's  
<a onclick="modifyYTiframeseektime('1035')">0:17:15</a> obviously a certain state where you sort  
<a onclick="modifyYTiframeseektime('1037')">0:17:17</a> of engrossed in the immediate  
<a onclick="modifyYTiframeseektime('1039')">0:17:19</a> and it's i don't mean to say this in  
<a onclick="modifyYTiframeseektime('1041')">0:17:21</a> like a  
<a onclick="modifyYTiframeseektime('1042')">0:17:22</a> a negative sense because obviously it's  
<a onclick="modifyYTiframeseektime('1044')">0:17:24</a> not negative um necessarily  
<a onclick="modifyYTiframeseektime('1046')">0:17:26</a> but it's quite childlike you're only  
<a onclick="modifyYTiframeseektime('1049')">0:17:29</a> sort of aware of  
<a onclick="modifyYTiframeseektime('1050')">0:17:30</a> the now um it's very present funnily  
<a onclick="modifyYTiframeseektime('1053')">0:17:33</a> enough there's a lot of books now trying  
<a onclick="modifyYTiframeseektime('1055')">0:17:35</a> to get you to be  
<a onclick="modifyYTiframeseektime('1056')">0:17:36</a> solely pinned in the present um  
<a onclick="modifyYTiframeseektime('1059')">0:17:39</a> but there's a certain sort of

<a onclick="modifyYTiframeseektime('1066')">0:17:46</a> well you know where did all of this come

<a onclick="modifyYTiframeseektime('1076')">0:17:56</a> um that usually just comes with maturity

<a onclick="modifyYTiframeseektime('1093')">0:18:13</a> some people it takes a different amount

<a onclick="modifyYTiframeseektime('1102')">0:18:22</a> um sometimes i think it's mostly  
<a onclick="modifyYTiframeseektime('1106')">0:18:26</a> um i don't know something bad happens or  
<a onclick="modifyYTiframeseektime('1108')">0:18:28</a> some sort of trauma someone passes away  
<a onclick="modifyYTiframeseektime('1110')">0:18:30</a> then these that sort of things start to

<a onclick="modifyYTiframeseektime('1123')">0:18:43</a> but yeah it's a i think that's probably  
<a onclick="modifyYTiframeseektime('1125')">0:18:45</a> the main reason um they're just sort of  
<a onclick="modifyYTiframeseektime('1127')">0:18:47</a> engrossed

<a onclick="modifyYTiframeseektime('1177')">0:19:37</a> but i really want to know the the truth  
<a onclick="modifyYTiframeseektime('1180')">0:19:40</a> about this concept of gira which is

<a onclick="modifyYTiframeseektime('1206')">0:20:06</a> and that if she does it's an insult to

<a onclick="modifyYTiframeseektime('1223')">0:20:23</a> this is something that i've been coming  
<a onclick="modifyYTiframeseektime('1225')">0:20:25</a> across with some  
<a onclick="modifyYTiframeseektime('1226')">0:20:26</a> people and i don't know the truth about  
<a onclick="modifyYTiframeseektime('1228')">0:20:28</a> it i think there's a balance in today's  
<a onclick="modifyYTiframeseektime('1230')">0:20:30</a> age and  
<a onclick="modifyYTiframeseektime('1231')">0:20:31</a> you know if you're living in a very

<a onclick="modifyYTiframeseektime('1235')">0:20:35</a> and you can have like two days at a job  
<a onclick="modifyYTiframeseektime('1238')">0:20:38</a> as like a cashier or something to help  
<a onclick="modifyYTiframeseektime('1240')">0:20:40</a> get out of the ghetto i think that's  
<a onclick="modifyYTiframeseektime('1242')">0:20:42</a> much smarter than you know  
<a onclick="modifyYTiframeseektime('1244')">0:20:44</a> staying in a place where there's a lot

<a onclick="modifyYTiframeseektime('1248')">0:20:48</a> there's like a there must be some sort  
<a onclick="modifyYTiframeseektime('1249')">0:20:49</a> of balance here  
<a onclick="modifyYTiframeseektime('1251')">0:20:51</a> you know like if you can't stay home and  
<a onclick="modifyYTiframeseektime('1253')">0:20:53</a> you you that's safe  
<a onclick="modifyYTiframeseektime('1254')">0:20:54</a> but in today's economy people lose their  
<a onclick="modifyYTiframeseektime('1257')">0:20:57</a> jobs  
<a onclick="modifyYTiframeseektime('1258')">0:20:58</a> poverty is around i don't know i feel  
<a onclick="modifyYTiframeseektime('1260')">0:21:00</a> like there's got to be some type of  
<a onclick="modifyYTiframeseektime('1262')">0:21:02</a> middle  
<a onclick="modifyYTiframeseektime('1263')">0:21:03</a> way or like different approach about it  
<a onclick="modifyYTiframeseektime('1265')">0:21:05</a> because it seems that a lot of suitors  
<a onclick="modifyYTiframeseektime('1267')">0:21:07</a> and a lot of people  
<a onclick="modifyYTiframeseektime('1269')">0:21:09</a> they've been saying stuff like that like  
<a onclick="modifyYTiframeseektime('1271')">0:21:11</a> they don't want the women to have any  
<a onclick="modifyYTiframeseektime('1272')">0:21:12</a> social media  
<a onclick="modifyYTiframeseektime('1273')">0:21:13</a> she cannot even have her voice sometimes  
<a onclick="modifyYTiframeseektime('1276')">0:21:16</a> she cannot  
<a onclick="modifyYTiframeseektime('1277')">0:21:17</a> have a job she can't go to school she  
<a onclick="modifyYTiframeseektime('1279')">0:21:19</a> has to literally just stay inside  
<a onclick="modifyYTiframeseektime('1281')">0:21:21</a> all day unless she's with somebody and i  
<a onclick="modifyYTiframeseektime('1285')">0:21:25</a> understand maybe that works in some  
<a onclick="modifyYTiframeseektime('1286')">0:21:26</a> areas but  
<a onclick="modifyYTiframeseektime('1287')">0:21:27</a> what if you have to go somewhere i mean  
<a onclick="modifyYTiframeseektime('1289')">0:21:29</a> i'm starting to wonder which is islam  
<a onclick="modifyYTiframeseektime('1291')">0:21:31</a> and which is culture and personal  
<a onclick="modifyYTiframeseektime('1293')">0:21:33</a> preference  
<a onclick="modifyYTiframeseektime('1294')">0:21:34</a> you see i hope i made that clear yes  
<a onclick="modifyYTiframeseektime('1297')">0:21:37</a> sister sister  
<a onclick="modifyYTiframeseektime('1298')">0:21:38</a> one thing we have to make  
<a onclick="modifyYTiframeseektime('1301')">0:21:41</a> put it on so there's no echoes yeah so  
<a onclick="modifyYTiframeseektime('1303')">0:21:43</a> what you have to make very clear sister  
<a onclick="modifyYTiframeseektime('1305')">0:21:45</a> is  
<a onclick="modifyYTiframeseektime('1306')">0:21:46</a> that our kind of policy sequence  
<a onclick="modifyYTiframeseektime('1308')">0:21:48</a> institute that we don't really going to  
<a onclick="modifyYTiframeseektime('1310')">0:21:50</a> fit matters okay  
<a onclick="modifyYTiframeseektime('1311')">0:21:51</a> so that's very important so this  
<a onclick="modifyYTiframeseektime('1313')">0:21:53</a> question has to go to someone who's  
<a onclick="modifyYTiframeseektime('1315')">0:21:55</a> qualified and someone that you trust  
<a onclick="modifyYTiframeseektime('1316')">0:21:56</a> okay however notwithstanding is very  
<a onclick="modifyYTiframeseektime('1319')">0:21:59</a> important to note a few things  
<a onclick="modifyYTiframeseektime('1321')">0:22:01</a> uh which is like a positive jealousy for  
<a onclick="modifyYTiframeseektime('1324')">0:22:04</a> your spouse which goes both ways by the  
<a onclick="modifyYTiframeseektime('1326')">0:22:06</a> way it's not just the male to the  
<a onclick="modifyYTiframeseektime('1327')">0:22:07</a> females the female to the man  
<a onclick="modifyYTiframeseektime('1328')">0:22:08</a> is like a protective type of jealousy  
<a onclick="modifyYTiframeseektime('1330')">0:22:10</a> and this is highly  
<a onclick="modifyYTiframeseektime('1332')">0:22:12</a> a high ethic in the islamic tradition  
<a onclick="modifyYTiframeseektime('1334')">0:22:14</a> however as a general principle it should  
<a onclick="modifyYTiframeseektime('1336')">0:22:16</a> not be used to oppress anyone  
<a onclick="modifyYTiframeseektime('1338')">0:22:18</a> it should not be used to make anyone  
<a onclick="modifyYTiframeseektime('1340')">0:22:20</a> feel that their well-being has been  
<a onclick="modifyYTiframeseektime('1342')">0:22:22</a> diminished  
<a onclick="modifyYTiframeseektime('1343')">0:22:23</a> that their self-esteem is diminished  
<a onclick="modifyYTiframeseektime('1345')">0:22:25</a> that they have a lack of psychological  
<a onclick="modifyYTiframeseektime('1347')">0:22:27</a> well-being mental  
<a onclick="modifyYTiframeseektime('1348')">0:22:28</a> well-being and physical well-being and  
<a onclick="modifyYTiframeseektime('1349')">0:22:29</a> even social well-being and that  
<a onclick="modifyYTiframeseektime('1351')">0:22:31</a> difference  
<a onclick="modifyYTiframeseektime('1352')">0:22:32</a> differs from society to society because  
<a onclick="modifyYTiframeseektime('1354')">0:22:34</a> there is a concept in thick  
<a onclick="modifyYTiframeseektime('1357')">0:22:37</a> called the social customs now what  
<a onclick="modifyYTiframeseektime('1359')">0:22:39</a> you're describing  
<a onclick="modifyYTiframeseektime('1360')">0:22:40</a> if someone is preventing you from  
<a onclick="modifyYTiframeseektime('1361')">0:22:41</a> breathing preventing you from education  
<a onclick="modifyYTiframeseektime('1363')">0:22:43</a> and preventing from one of these things  
<a onclick="modifyYTiframeseektime('1365')">0:22:45</a> then that sounds like oppression rather  
<a onclick="modifyYTiframeseektime('1367')">0:22:47</a> than a gear because we have to  
<a onclick="modifyYTiframeseektime('1368')">0:22:48</a> understand this from a  
<a onclick="modifyYTiframeseektime('1369')">0:22:49</a> kind of pure spiritual perspective if  
<a onclick="modifyYTiframeseektime('1372')">0:22:52</a> one doesn't have an ego  
<a onclick="modifyYTiframeseektime('1373')">0:22:53</a> they don't have for example this the  
<a onclick="modifyYTiframeseektime('1375')">0:22:55</a> diseases of the heart like  
<a onclick="modifyYTiframeseektime('1377')">0:22:57</a> hassa jealousy blame worthy jealousy  
<a onclick="modifyYTiframeseektime('1380')">0:23:00</a> kibber and arrogance  
<a onclick="modifyYTiframeseektime('1382')">0:23:02</a> if they don't have these things then

<a onclick="modifyYTiframeseektime('1398')">0:23:18</a> that's going to be very positive and

<a onclick="modifyYTiframeseektime('1401')">0:23:21</a> and the house and society but if it ends  
<a onclick="modifyYTiframeseektime('1404')">0:23:24</a> up if someone has for example an eagle  
<a onclick="modifyYTiframeseektime('1406')">0:23:26</a> and they're just using the concept of

<a onclick="modifyYTiframeseektime('1409')">0:23:29</a> just to oppress someone just to prevent

<a onclick="modifyYTiframeseektime('1463')">0:24:23</a> and liberate society  
<a onclick="modifyYTiframeseektime('1465')">0:24:25</a> and it will be nowhere near oppression  
<a onclick="modifyYTiframeseektime('1468')">0:24:28</a> and nowhere near what you've just  
<a onclick="modifyYTiframeseektime('1470')">0:24:30</a> described in sha allah but here as a  
<a onclick="modifyYTiframeseektime('1472')">0:24:32</a> concept is a very important  
<a onclick="modifyYTiframeseektime('1473')">0:24:33</a> to have in actual fact many of our men  
<a onclick="modifyYTiframeseektime('1476')">0:24:36</a> unfortunately do not have  
<a onclick="modifyYTiframeseektime('1477')">0:24:37</a> hira which is an unfortunate situation  
<a onclick="modifyYTiframeseektime('1479')">0:24:39</a> you know you know  
<a onclick="modifyYTiframeseektime('1481')">0:24:41</a> for example they'll take selfies with  
<a onclick="modifyYTiframeseektime('1483')">0:24:43</a> their wife put on instagram all the time  
<a onclick="modifyYTiframeseektime('1485')">0:24:45</a> make sure her wife's got all the makeup  
<a onclick="modifyYTiframeseektime('1486')">0:24:46</a> on  
<a onclick="modifyYTiframeseektime('1487')">0:24:47</a> does the pal put on instagram with all  
<a onclick="modifyYTiframeseektime('1489')">0:24:49</a> due respect  
<a onclick="modifyYTiframeseektime('1490')">0:24:50</a> i don't find these people they don't  
<a onclick="modifyYTiframeseektime('1492')">0:24:52</a> have any hero  
<a onclick="modifyYTiframeseektime('1493')">0:24:53</a> and this is not part of the islamic  
<a onclick="modifyYTiframeseektime('1495')">0:24:55</a> ethic  
<a onclick="modifyYTiframeseektime('1496')">0:24:56</a> uh and this is just a very simple thing  
<a onclick="modifyYTiframeseektime('1498')">0:24:58</a> and if people don't like it  
<a onclick="modifyYTiframeseektime('1500')">0:25:00</a> then tough uh that's so that's positive  
<a onclick="modifyYTiframeseektime('1503')">0:25:03</a> you know and even for the man if the man  
<a onclick="modifyYTiframeseektime('1505')">0:25:05</a> has for example  
<a onclick="modifyYTiframeseektime('1506')">0:25:06</a> big guns and his wife says you know i  
<a onclick="modifyYTiframeseektime('1508')">0:25:08</a> don't want i don't want you showing your  
<a onclick="modifyYTiframeseektime('1509')">0:25:09</a> biceps in public  
<a onclick="modifyYTiframeseektime('1510')">0:25:10</a> it's for me man you know this is beyond  
<a onclick="modifyYTiframeseektime('1513')">0:25:13</a> the kind of  
<a onclick="modifyYTiframeseektime('1516')">0:25:16</a> the black and white haram this is about  
<a onclick="modifyYTiframeseektime('1518')">0:25:18</a> appreciating your wife  
<a onclick="modifyYTiframeseektime('1519')">0:25:19</a> appreciating her needs and you should be  
<a onclick="modifyYTiframeseektime('1522')">0:25:22</a> as a husband you know what  
<a onclick="modifyYTiframeseektime('1523')">0:25:23</a> i won't wear short sleeve or i'll wear  
<a onclick="modifyYTiframeseektime('1525')">0:25:25</a> clothes that  
<a onclick="modifyYTiframeseektime('1526')">0:25:26</a> you you you that you like this is  
<a onclick="modifyYTiframeseektime('1528')">0:25:28</a> something to do with a loving  
<a onclick="modifyYTiframeseektime('1529')">0:25:29</a> relationship that you have based on  
<a onclick="modifyYTiframeseektime('1531')">0:25:31</a> love mercy and tolerance and so on and  
<a onclick="modifyYTiframeseektime('1534')">0:25:34</a> so forth  
<a onclick="modifyYTiframeseektime('1534')">0:25:34</a> so the point i'm trying to say is a very  
<a onclick="modifyYTiframeseektime('1536')">0:25:36</a> important concept in our tradition  
<a onclick="modifyYTiframeseektime('1538')">0:25:38</a> uh please go to a scholar though based  
<a onclick="modifyYTiframeseektime('1540')">0:25:40</a> on the nuances and i'm telling you he's  
<a onclick="modifyYTiframeseektime('1542')">0:25:42</a> going to give you an answer in sha allah  
<a onclick="modifyYTiframeseektime('1543')">0:25:43</a> that's going to be far away from  
<a onclick="modifyYTiframeseektime('1545')">0:25:45</a> oppression and he's going to make you  
<a onclick="modifyYTiframeseektime('1546')">0:25:46</a> understand the concept  
<a onclick="modifyYTiframeseektime('1547')">0:25:47</a> in a better way than i have expressed  
<a onclick="modifyYTiframeseektime('1549')">0:25:49</a> and in a way that's going to be  
<a onclick="modifyYTiframeseektime('1550')">0:25:50</a> liberating for your household  
<a onclick="modifyYTiframeseektime('1552')">0:25:52</a> and it's going to bring you all closer  
<a onclick="modifyYTiframeseektime('1553')">0:25:53</a> to allah and it's all going to achieve  
<a onclick="modifyYTiframeseektime('1556')">0:25:56</a> a sense of well-being for all of you but  
<a onclick="modifyYTiframeseektime('1558')">0:25:58</a> never allow anyone to use this concept  
<a onclick="modifyYTiframeseektime('1560')">0:26:00</a> just as a manifestation of the  
<a onclick="modifyYTiframeseektime('1561')">0:26:01</a> possessiveness and manifestation of the  
<a onclick="modifyYTiframeseektime('1564')">0:26:04</a> ego  
<a onclick="modifyYTiframeseektime('1564')">0:26:04</a> because this is a big spiritual disease  
<a onclick="modifyYTiframeseektime('1566')">0:26:06</a> and sometimes people  
<a onclick="modifyYTiframeseektime('1568')">0:26:08</a> use these ethics in islam this is an  
<a onclick="modifyYTiframeseektime('1570')">0:26:10</a> excuse  
<a onclick="modifyYTiframeseektime('1571')">0:26:11</a> to oppress other people and this is a  
<a onclick="modifyYTiframeseektime('1573')">0:26:13</a> sign of weakness this is not a sign of a  
<a onclick="modifyYTiframeseektime('1575')">0:26:15</a> man  
<a onclick="modifyYTiframeseektime('1576')">0:26:16</a> so i hope that is clarified the sister  
<a onclick="modifyYTiframeseektime('1578')">0:26:18</a> but in terms of specific thick  
<a onclick="modifyYTiframeseektime('1580')">0:26:20</a> questions this is beyond us we have to  
<a onclick="modifyYTiframeseektime('1582')">0:26:22</a> stick to the field philosophical  
<a onclick="modifyYTiframeseektime('1584')">0:26:24</a> stuff okay if i could just add by  
<a onclick="modifyYTiframeseektime('1587')">0:26:27</a> um sorry you saw me did you want to say  
<a onclick="modifyYTiframeseektime('1589')">0:26:29</a> something  
<a onclick="modifyYTiframeseektime('1590')">0:26:30</a> oh so i had another question if if  
<a onclick="modifyYTiframeseektime('1592')">0:26:32</a> that's okay  
<a onclick="modifyYTiframeseektime('1594')">0:26:34</a> do you mind if i just add to what you  
<a onclick="modifyYTiframeseektime('1596')">0:26:36</a> said before we move on oh totally yeah  
<a onclick="modifyYTiframeseektime('1598')">0:26:38</a> so i i would recommend um reading into  
<a onclick="modifyYTiframeseektime('1600')">0:26:40</a> two of the wives of the prophet muhammad  
<a onclick="modifyYTiframeseektime('1602')">0:26:42</a> um first one being aisha and  
<a onclick="modifyYTiframeseektime('1605')">0:26:45</a> um how do you say her name  
<a onclick="modifyYTiframeseektime('1613')">0:26:53</a> um both of these sisters were very  
<a onclick="modifyYTiframeseektime('1615')">0:26:55</a> empowered um  
<a onclick="modifyYTiframeseektime('1618')">0:26:58</a> was uh very vocal she wasn't this  
<a onclick="modifyYTiframeseektime('1621')">0:27:01</a> sheepish  
<a onclick="modifyYTiframeseektime('1622')">0:27:02</a> shy person um she spoke her mind um  
<a onclick="modifyYTiframeseektime('1625')">0:27:05</a> you know she was active she was one of  
<a onclick="modifyYTiframeseektime('1627')">0:27:07</a> the largest scholars in  
<a onclick="modifyYTiframeseektime('1629')">0:27:09</a> islam the majority of the hadith we get  
<a onclick="modifyYTiframeseektime('1631')">0:27:11</a> are from her  
<a onclick="modifyYTiframeseektime('1632')">0:27:12</a> um so like even from the you know the  
<a onclick="modifyYTiframeseektime('1635')">0:27:15</a> very beginning we have this idea of um  
<a onclick="modifyYTiframeseektime('1638')">0:27:18</a> you know intellectual pursuits  
<a onclick="modifyYTiframeseektime('1640')">0:27:20</a> within the the sisters of islam or the  
<a onclick="modifyYTiframeseektime('1642')">0:27:22</a> the women of islam  
<a onclick="modifyYTiframeseektime('1643')">0:27:23</a> and khadijah was a businesswoman and  
<a onclick="modifyYTiframeseektime('1647')">0:27:27</a> the the way they um the prophet muhammad  
<a onclick="modifyYTiframeseektime('1650')">0:27:30</a> um became familiar with each other was  
<a onclick="modifyYTiframeseektime('1652')">0:27:32</a> through business  
<a onclick="modifyYTiframeseektime('1654')">0:27:34</a> she would send him um on expeditions  
<a onclick="modifyYTiframeseektime('1657')">0:27:37</a> uh to do business elsewhere outside of  
<a onclick="modifyYTiframeseektime('1659')">0:27:39</a> um  
<a onclick="modifyYTiframeseektime('1660')">0:27:40</a> the you know the where they were in  
<a onclick="modifyYTiframeseektime('1662')">0:27:42</a> medina and mecca et cetera so  
<a onclick="modifyYTiframeseektime('1665')">0:27:45</a> this notion that there's sort of like  
<a onclick="modifyYTiframeseektime('1667')">0:27:47</a> they're hidden away in a cupboard almost  
<a onclick="modifyYTiframeseektime('1669')">0:27:49</a> you know this caricature  
<a onclick="modifyYTiframeseektime('1671')">0:27:51</a> of is islamic wives um i think is is far  
<a onclick="modifyYTiframeseektime('1674')">0:27:54</a> from the truth and just looking into  
<a onclick="modifyYTiframeseektime('1676')">0:27:56</a> these two particular  
<a onclick="modifyYTiframeseektime('1677')">0:27:57</a> characters the two wives of the prophet  
<a onclick="modifyYTiframeseektime('1679')">0:27:59</a> muhammad sallam  
<a onclick="modifyYTiframeseektime('1680')">0:28:00</a> i think should sort of elucidate a lot  
<a onclick="modifyYTiframeseektime('1682')">0:28:02</a> of the  
<a onclick="modifyYTiframeseektime('1683')">0:28:03</a> um the the image that we we have of the  
<a onclick="modifyYTiframeseektime('1686')">0:28:06</a> you know the the early women in uh islam  
<a onclick="modifyYTiframeseektime('1689')">0:28:09</a> inshallah but um i hope that helps  
<a onclick="modifyYTiframeseektime('1691')">0:28:11</a> anyway and uh  
<a onclick="modifyYTiframeseektime('1694')">0:28:14</a> as general principles these are very  
<a onclick="modifyYTiframeseektime('1696')">0:28:16</a> sound principles exactly yusuf but if  
<a onclick="modifyYTiframeseektime('1698')">0:28:18</a> there's a specific  
<a onclick="modifyYTiframeseektime('1699')">0:28:19</a> concept where one husband says something  
<a onclick="modifyYTiframeseektime('1701')">0:28:21</a> to another wife and there was a  
<a onclick="modifyYTiframeseektime('1702')">0:28:22</a> discussion this is beyond us  
<a onclick="modifyYTiframeseektime('1704')">0:28:24</a> and that requires basically scholarship  
<a onclick="modifyYTiframeseektime('1706')">0:28:26</a> insha allah but as a general principle  
<a onclick="modifyYTiframeseektime('1707')">0:28:27</a> we said  
<a onclick="modifyYTiframeseektime('1708')">0:28:28</a> that islam prevents oppression that  
<a onclick="modifyYTiframeseektime('1710')">0:28:30</a> there is a concept of here by some  
<a onclick="modifyYTiframeseektime('1711')">0:28:31</a> positive concept and it increases the  
<a onclick="modifyYTiframeseektime('1713')">0:28:33</a> spiritual and social well-being  
<a onclick="modifyYTiframeseektime('1715')">0:28:35</a> well-being of both people  
<a onclick="modifyYTiframeseektime('1716')">0:28:36</a> and of the famine of the household and  
<a onclick="modifyYTiframeseektime('1718')">0:28:38</a> yes if you look at the lives of the  
<a onclick="modifyYTiframeseektime('1719')">0:28:39</a> wives of the prophet sallallahu alaihi  
<a onclick="modifyYTiframeseektime('1721')">0:28:41</a> wasallam you know you had aisha who was  
<a onclick="modifyYTiframeseektime('1724')">0:28:44</a> very strong and assertive  
<a onclick="modifyYTiframeseektime('1725')">0:28:45</a> especially in articulating herself yeah  
<a onclick="modifyYTiframeseektime('1727')">0:28:47</a> khadijah rajala  
<a onclick="modifyYTiframeseektime('1729')">0:28:49</a> was a businesswoman and so on and so  
<a onclick="modifyYTiframeseektime('1730')">0:28:50</a> forth i remember all of that was done  
<a onclick="modifyYTiframeseektime('1732')">0:28:52</a> within the context of the islamic values  
<a onclick="modifyYTiframeseektime('1734')">0:28:54</a> as well  
<a onclick="modifyYTiframeseektime('1734')">0:28:54</a> so uh and this is very good that you  
<a onclick="modifyYTiframeseektime('1737')">0:28:57</a> raise this question just to let everyone  
<a onclick="modifyYTiframeseektime('1738')">0:28:58</a> know that we're not going to answer  
<a onclick="modifyYTiframeseektime('1739')">0:28:59</a> specific freaky questions  
<a onclick="modifyYTiframeseektime('1741')">0:29:01</a> but please uh please give us your other  
<a onclick="modifyYTiframeseektime('1743')">0:29:03</a> question inshallah  
<a onclick="modifyYTiframeseektime('1745')">0:29:05</a> okay so i've noticed there is a i don't  
<a onclick="modifyYTiframeseektime('1748')">0:29:08</a> know if you're familiar with it but it's  
<a onclick="modifyYTiframeseektime('1749')">0:29:09</a> called a red pill movement where these  
<a onclick="modifyYTiframeseektime('1751')">0:29:11</a> young brothers are telling younger  
<a onclick="modifyYTiframeseektime('1752')">0:29:12</a> brothers that  
<a onclick="modifyYTiframeseektime('1754')">0:29:14</a> divorced women and you know reaver  
<a onclick="modifyYTiframeseektime('1756')">0:29:16</a> sisters who are not virgins are like  
<a onclick="modifyYTiframeseektime('1759')">0:29:19</a> toxic trash  
<a onclick="modifyYTiframeseektime('1760')">0:29:20</a> and they're really teaching the young  
<a onclick="modifyYTiframeseektime('1762')">0:29:22</a> men to not ever  
<a onclick="modifyYTiframeseektime('1764')">0:29:24</a> marry a single mother to stay away from  
<a onclick="modifyYTiframeseektime('1766')">0:29:26</a> divorced women  
<a onclick="modifyYTiframeseektime('1768')">0:29:28</a> and they're really being quite vulgar  
<a onclick="modifyYTiframeseektime('1770')">0:29:30</a> towards you know  
<a onclick="modifyYTiframeseektime('1771')">0:29:31</a> the younger men and how they're trying  
<a onclick="modifyYTiframeseektime('1773')">0:29:33</a> to find wives  
<a onclick="modifyYTiframeseektime('1774')">0:29:34</a> and since polygamy you know polygyny is  
<a onclick="modifyYTiframeseektime('1777')">0:29:37</a> allowed  
<a onclick="modifyYTiframeseektime('1778')">0:29:38</a> this would that system of polygony is  
<a onclick="modifyYTiframeseektime('1781')">0:29:41</a> beneficial towards women who  
<a onclick="modifyYTiframeseektime('1783')">0:29:43</a> have had a brutal divorce and stuff like  
<a onclick="modifyYTiframeseektime('1785')">0:29:45</a> that so what would you say to  
<a onclick="modifyYTiframeseektime('1787')">0:29:47</a> like those young brothers who are trying  
<a onclick="modifyYTiframeseektime('1788')">0:29:48</a> to really brainwash  
<a onclick="modifyYTiframeseektime('1790')">0:29:50</a> these young brothers into hating uh  
<a onclick="modifyYTiframeseektime('1793')">0:29:53</a> women because  
<a onclick="modifyYTiframeseektime('1794')">0:29:54</a> they're western women who are not  
<a onclick="modifyYTiframeseektime('1796')">0:29:56</a> virgins and  
<a onclick="modifyYTiframeseektime('1798')">0:29:58</a> who are divorcees or single mothers and  
<a onclick="modifyYTiframeseektime('1801')">0:30:01</a> stuff like that what would you say to  
<a onclick="modifyYTiframeseektime('1802')">0:30:02</a> that  
<a onclick="modifyYTiframeseektime('1803')">0:30:03</a> yes so i'm not aware of this  
<a onclick="modifyYTiframeseektime('1806')">0:30:06</a> and uh but again this is  
<a onclick="modifyYTiframeseektime('1810')">0:30:10</a> in the realm of the issue but it's to do  
<a onclick="modifyYTiframeseektime('1812')">0:30:12</a> with islamic values and ethics which we  
<a onclick="modifyYTiframeseektime('1813')">0:30:13</a> do talk about  
<a onclick="modifyYTiframeseektime('1814')">0:30:14</a> the first thing to say is these men are  
<a onclick="modifyYTiframeseektime('1816')">0:30:16</a> little boys  
<a onclick="modifyYTiframeseektime('1817')">0:30:17</a> very weak individuals who have no  
<a onclick="modifyYTiframeseektime('1819')">0:30:19</a> spirituality and have no connection with  
<a onclick="modifyYTiframeseektime('1821')">0:30:21</a> islam or allah  
<a onclick="modifyYTiframeseektime('1823')">0:30:23</a> because if you really take the logical  
<a onclick="modifyYTiframeseektime('1825')">0:30:25</a> consequence of what they said  
<a onclick="modifyYTiframeseektime('1826')">0:30:26</a> they are actually saying that the  
<a onclick="modifyYTiframeseektime('1828')">0:30:28</a> prophet sallallahu  
<a onclick="modifyYTiframeseektime('1829')">0:30:29</a> alaihi wasallam was not a real man may  
<a onclick="modifyYTiframeseektime('1831')">0:30:31</a> allah protect us from such stupidity  
<a onclick="modifyYTiframeseektime('1833')">0:30:33</a> because the prophet sallallahu alaihi  
<a onclick="modifyYTiframeseektime('1835')">0:30:35</a> was married were  
<a onclick="modifyYTiframeseektime('1837')">0:30:37</a> women who were basically not virgins the  
<a onclick="modifyYTiframeseektime('1840')">0:30:40</a> prophet sallallahu alaihi wasallam  
<a onclick="modifyYTiframeseektime('1842')">0:30:42</a> married women who had uh previous  
<a onclick="modifyYTiframeseektime('1844')">0:30:44</a> husbands and so on and so forth so to  
<a onclick="modifyYTiframeseektime('1846')">0:30:46</a> even make such a ridiculous claim  
<a onclick="modifyYTiframeseektime('1849')">0:30:49</a> is counter to the life of the prophet  
<a onclick="modifyYTiframeseektime('1851')">0:30:51</a> sallallahu alaihi wasallam  
<a onclick="modifyYTiframeseektime('1852')">0:30:52</a> is absolutely ridiculous yes we have our  
<a onclick="modifyYTiframeseektime('1855')">0:30:55</a> ethical tradition  
<a onclick="modifyYTiframeseektime('1856')">0:30:56</a> and there's virtues for marrying this  
<a onclick="modifyYTiframeseektime('1858')">0:30:58</a> type of woman or that type of woman or

<a onclick="modifyYTiframeseektime('1976')">0:32:56</a> funnily enough  
<a onclick="modifyYTiframeseektime('1977')">0:32:57</a> um they seem to sort of be quite  
<a onclick="modifyYTiframeseektime('1979')">0:32:59</a> characterized by this sort of  
<a onclick="modifyYTiframeseektime('1981')">0:33:01</a> overwhelming force um but yeah so i  
<a onclick="modifyYTiframeseektime('1984')">0:33:04</a> think  
<a onclick="modifyYTiframeseektime('1985')">0:33:05</a> it's like what the hamza was just saying  
<a onclick="modifyYTiframeseektime('1986')">0:33:06</a> then um i'm pretty sure the majority of  
<a onclick="modifyYTiframeseektime('1989')">0:33:09</a> the wives that the prophet muhammad  
<a onclick="modifyYTiframeseektime('1990')">0:33:10</a> sallallahu salaam  
<a onclick="modifyYTiframeseektime('1992')">0:33:12</a> were not virgins so they were previously  
<a onclick="modifyYTiframeseektime('1994')">0:33:14</a> married or they were widowed  
<a onclick="modifyYTiframeseektime('1996')">0:33:16</a> um and he he took them and they  
<a onclick="modifyYTiframeseektime('1999')">0:33:19</a> um he married them and the quran says  
<a onclick="modifyYTiframeseektime('2002')">0:33:22</a> chapter 4 verse 19 and live them live  
<a onclick="modifyYTiframeseektime('2005')">0:33:25</a> with them with kindness  
<a onclick="modifyYTiframeseektime('2007')">0:33:27</a> or in kindness that is to you know treat  
<a onclick="modifyYTiframeseektime('2009')">0:33:29</a> them well to  
<a onclick="modifyYTiframeseektime('2010')">0:33:30</a> not this sort of um brutish mentality  
<a onclick="modifyYTiframeseektime('2014')">0:33:34</a> that these particular individuals put  
<a onclick="modifyYTiframeseektime('2015')">0:33:35</a> forward where  
<a onclick="modifyYTiframeseektime('2016')">0:33:36</a> they they turn the um the male female

<a onclick="modifyYTiframeseektime('2021')">0:33:41</a> almost absolutely yes um so what's a  
<a onclick="modifyYTiframeseektime('2024')">0:33:44</a> really good story  
<a onclick="modifyYTiframeseektime('2025')">0:33:45</a> is one day when aisha raj there was some  
<a onclick="modifyYTiframeseektime('2028')">0:33:48</a> food  
<a onclick="modifyYTiframeseektime('2029')">0:33:49</a> being served and i believe she was  
<a onclick="modifyYTiframeseektime('2031')">0:33:51</a> slightly jealous  
<a onclick="modifyYTiframeseektime('2033')">0:33:53</a> and i think she was either broke a play  
<a onclick="modifyYTiframeseektime('2035')">0:33:55</a> or something happened that wasn't you  
<a onclick="modifyYTiframeseektime('2036')">0:33:56</a> know very nice  
<a onclick="modifyYTiframeseektime('2038')">0:33:58</a> and the way the person responded he was  
<a onclick="modifyYTiframeseektime('2039')">0:33:59</a> like oh your mother is jealous or the  
<a onclick="modifyYTiframeseektime('2041')">0:34:01</a> way he responded very human nice way  
<a onclick="modifyYTiframeseektime('2043')">0:34:03</a> he didn't you know was egocentric and  
<a onclick="modifyYTiframeseektime('2046')">0:34:06</a> egotistical to say how dare you do this  
<a onclick="modifyYTiframeseektime('2048')">0:34:08</a> in front of them or whatever the case  
<a onclick="modifyYTiframeseektime('2049')">0:34:09</a> may be look if people follow the sunnah  
<a onclick="modifyYTiframeseektime('2052')">0:34:12</a> they would have the best marriages  
<a onclick="modifyYTiframeseektime('2054')">0:34:14</a> and what is the sunnah is to have help  
<a onclick="modifyYTiframeseektime('2056')">0:34:16</a> is to have forbearance  
<a onclick="modifyYTiframeseektime('2057')">0:34:17</a> to overlook faults is to look at your  
<a onclick="modifyYTiframeseektime('2059')">0:34:19</a> thoughts first you know the way of the  
<a onclick="modifyYTiframeseektime('2060')">0:34:20</a> salaf the way of the pious predecessors  
<a onclick="modifyYTiframeseektime('2063')">0:34:23</a> when they had issues with the  
<a onclick="modifyYTiframeseektime('2066')">0:34:26</a> with the women folk with their family  
<a onclick="modifyYTiframeseektime('2069')">0:34:29</a> the first thing they would look at you  
<a onclick="modifyYTiframeseektime('2070')">0:34:30</a> know they would look at  
<a onclick="modifyYTiframeseektime('2072')">0:34:32</a> themselves they'll look at themselves  
<a onclick="modifyYTiframeseektime('2074')">0:34:34</a> what sin did i commit  
<a onclick="modifyYTiframeseektime('2077')">0:34:37</a> how have i moved away from allah for  
<a onclick="modifyYTiframeseektime('2079')">0:34:39</a> this to happen at home  
<a onclick="modifyYTiframeseektime('2081')">0:34:41</a> because it's a very empowering  
<a onclick="modifyYTiframeseektime('2083')">0:34:43</a> philosophy the pious princes the salaf  
<a onclick="modifyYTiframeseektime('2086')">0:34:46</a> the true salaf the true spiritual

<a onclick="modifyYTiframeseektime('2089')">0:34:49</a> when they had these issues they would  
<a onclick="modifyYTiframeseektime('2091')">0:34:51</a> look into themselves they wouldn't blame  
<a onclick="modifyYTiframeseektime('2092')">0:34:52</a> a woman or blame anyone else the first  
<a onclick="modifyYTiframeseektime('2094')">0:34:54</a> thing they would do is look within  
<a onclick="modifyYTiframeseektime('2096')">0:34:56</a> within what i done where's my ego  
<a onclick="modifyYTiframeseektime('2099')">0:34:59</a> where's my problems where's my

<a onclick="modifyYTiframeseektime('2103')">0:35:03</a> connection  
<a onclick="modifyYTiframeseektime('2104')">0:35:04</a> and wallahi brothers and sisters  
<a onclick="modifyYTiframeseektime('2107')">0:35:07</a> i see this in my own life yeah in my own  
<a onclick="modifyYTiframeseektime('2114')">0:35:14</a> life  
<a onclick="modifyYTiframeseektime('2116')">0:35:16</a> when people move away from allah you're  
<a onclick="modifyYTiframeseektime('2118')">0:35:18</a> gonna have problems  
<a onclick="modifyYTiframeseektime('2119')">0:35:19</a> and then the ego is gonna teach you to  
<a onclick="modifyYTiframeseektime('2121')">0:35:21</a> blame others  
<a onclick="modifyYTiframeseektime('2122')">0:35:22</a> but i'm telling you the first thing the  
<a onclick="modifyYTiframeseektime('2124')">0:35:24</a> first person you to blame  
<a onclick="modifyYTiframeseektime('2125')">0:35:25</a> is yourself first find out yourself  
<a onclick="modifyYTiframeseektime('2128')">0:35:28</a> because once you fix your connection

<a onclick="modifyYTiframeseektime('2131')">0:35:31</a> everything else falls into place so this  
<a onclick="modifyYTiframeseektime('2134')">0:35:34</a> kind of  
<a onclick="modifyYTiframeseektime('2135')">0:35:35</a> default position that someone else is to

<a onclick="modifyYTiframeseektime('2523')">0:42:03</a> um a lot of anti-sacrifice propaganda is  
<a onclick="modifyYTiframeseektime('2525')">0:42:05</a> going on  
<a onclick="modifyYTiframeseektime('2526')">0:42:06</a> uh social media like uh a vegan eid  
<a onclick="modifyYTiframeseektime('2529')">0:42:09</a> lives matter uh even some ignorant  
<a onclick="modifyYTiframeseektime('2532')">0:42:12</a> muslims how to respond  
<a onclick="modifyYTiframeseektime('2534')">0:42:14</a> to such people well you know what's  
<a onclick="modifyYTiframeseektime('2537')">0:42:17</a> really funny right  
<a onclick="modifyYTiframeseektime('2538')">0:42:18</a> you know these ideological movements  
<a onclick="modifyYTiframeseektime('2541')">0:42:21</a> they have a philosophical basis and what  
<a onclick="modifyYTiframeseektime('2543')">0:42:23</a> we teach in the daoa  
<a onclick="modifyYTiframeseektime('2544')">0:42:24</a> especially when we teach in their course  
<a onclick="modifyYTiframeseektime('2546')">0:42:26</a> on no doubt and we teach and awakening  
<a onclick="modifyYTiframeseektime('2548')">0:42:28</a> the truth within we  
<a onclick="modifyYTiframeseektime('2549')">0:42:29</a> we teach about this concept called world  
<a onclick="modifyYTiframeseektime('2552')">0:42:32</a> views  
<a onclick="modifyYTiframeseektime('2553')">0:42:33</a> everyone has a worldview brothers and  
<a onclick="modifyYTiframeseektime('2554')">0:42:34</a> sisters right everyone has a world view  
<a onclick="modifyYTiframeseektime('2557')">0:42:37</a> and that vegans have a world view so why  
<a onclick="modifyYTiframeseektime('2559')">0:42:39</a> they saying this is because  
<a onclick="modifyYTiframeseektime('2561')">0:42:41</a> they believe in the vegan worldview so  
<a onclick="modifyYTiframeseektime('2562')">0:42:42</a> what do they believe they basically  
<a onclick="modifyYTiframeseektime('2564')">0:42:44</a> believe that  
<a onclick="modifyYTiframeseektime('2565')">0:42:45</a> you can't eat animals because it's  
<a onclick="modifyYTiframeseektime('2568')">0:42:48</a> uh there are sentient beings and  
<a onclick="modifyYTiframeseektime('2571')">0:42:51</a> basically it's equivalent of murder  
<a onclick="modifyYTiframeseektime('2572')">0:42:52</a> essentially  
<a onclick="modifyYTiframeseektime('2573')">0:42:53</a> why did they say this because they had  
<a onclick="modifyYTiframeseektime('2575')">0:42:55</a> their own philosophical assumptions  
<a onclick="modifyYTiframeseektime('2577')">0:42:57</a> behind that all you need to say is well  
<a onclick="modifyYTiframeseektime('2578')">0:42:58</a> you have false philosophical assumptions  
<a onclick="modifyYTiframeseektime('2580')">0:43:00</a> yes we agree that we shouldn't have over  
<a onclick="modifyYTiframeseektime('2583')">0:43:03</a> consumption  
<a onclick="modifyYTiframeseektime('2584')">0:43:04</a> we agree that we shouldn't harm animals  
<a onclick="modifyYTiframeseektime('2586')">0:43:06</a> if you study the way animals are stored  
<a onclick="modifyYTiframeseektime('2588')">0:43:08</a> in islam  
<a onclick="modifyYTiframeseektime('2588')">0:43:08</a> how animals are taken care of it's a  
<a onclick="modifyYTiframeseektime('2590')">0:43:10</a> phenomenal phenomenal ethical tradition  
<a onclick="modifyYTiframeseektime('2592')">0:43:12</a> so we agree with that aspect and we  
<a onclick="modifyYTiframeseektime('2594')">0:43:14</a> agree with  
<a onclick="modifyYTiframeseektime('2594')">0:43:14</a> over consumption but the philosophical  
<a onclick="modifyYTiframeseektime('2597')">0:43:17</a> basis is  
<a onclick="modifyYTiframeseektime('2598')">0:43:18</a> it's utter rejection of islam from that  
<a onclick="modifyYTiframeseektime('2600')">0:43:20</a> perspective and let me explain why  
<a onclick="modifyYTiframeseektime('2602')">0:43:22</a> allah subhanahu wa has said that these  
<a onclick="modifyYTiframeseektime('2605')">0:43:25</a> animals have been created  
<a onclick="modifyYTiframeseektime('2606')">0:43:26</a> for us to eat full stop you could prove  
<a onclick="modifyYTiframeseektime('2609')">0:43:29</a> that  
<a onclick="modifyYTiframeseektime('2609')">0:43:29</a> by showing them why the quran is from  
<a onclick="modifyYTiframeseektime('2611')">0:43:31</a> allah once they understand that  
<a onclick="modifyYTiframeseektime('2613')">0:43:33</a> all of the philosophy becomes redundant  
<a onclick="modifyYTiframeseektime('2615')">0:43:35</a> because it's come from  
<a onclick="modifyYTiframeseektime('2617')">0:43:37</a> it's come from the all wise and the  
<a onclick="modifyYTiframeseektime('2619')">0:43:39</a> all-knowing allah has the totality of  
<a onclick="modifyYTiframeseektime('2621')">0:43:41</a> knowledge and wisdom  
<a onclick="modifyYTiframeseektime('2622')">0:43:42</a> and he is the source of oh goodness and  
<a onclick="modifyYTiframeseektime('2624')">0:43:44</a> he commands that you could eat these  
<a onclick="modifyYTiframeseektime('2625')">0:43:45</a> animals  
<a onclick="modifyYTiframeseektime('2626')">0:43:46</a> first stop it's an easy easy equation  
<a onclick="modifyYTiframeseektime('2628')">0:43:48</a> you prove the quran is from allah  
<a onclick="modifyYTiframeseektime('2631')">0:43:51</a> and you prove that the quran says that  
<a onclick="modifyYTiframeseektime('2632')">0:43:52</a> allah is the all-knowing the all wise  
<a onclick="modifyYTiframeseektime('2634')">0:43:54</a> and he is the source of  
<a onclick="modifyYTiframeseektime('2635')">0:43:55</a> goodness so therefore what he commands  
<a onclick="modifyYTiframeseektime('2637')">0:43:57</a> is going to be the best  
<a onclick="modifyYTiframeseektime('2638')">0:43:58</a> full stop however be nuanced appreciate  
<a onclick="modifyYTiframeseektime('2641')">0:44:01</a> the ethical dimension  
<a onclick="modifyYTiframeseektime('2642')">0:44:02</a> that yes overconsumption is not good  
<a onclick="modifyYTiframeseektime('2644')">0:44:04</a> that animals are being treated really  
<a onclick="modifyYTiframeseektime('2645')">0:44:05</a> really bad it's not in line with  
<a onclick="modifyYTiframeseektime('2647')">0:44:07</a> designing ethics for sure but the

<a onclick="modifyYTiframeseektime('2649')">0:44:09</a> totally totally  
<a onclick="modifyYTiframeseektime('2651')">0:44:11</a> incoherent in actual fact there's a  
<a onclick="modifyYTiframeseektime('2653')">0:44:13</a> scientific study study to show  
<a onclick="modifyYTiframeseektime('2655')">0:44:15</a> that trees have pain plants have pain

<a onclick="modifyYTiframeseektime('2665')">0:44:25</a> they are living and they have pain they  
<a onclick="modifyYTiframeseektime('2667')">0:44:27</a> react  
<a onclick="modifyYTiframeseektime('2668')">0:44:28</a> in a way that could be described as pain  
<a onclick="modifyYTiframeseektime('2670')">0:44:30</a> especially some trees if you read the  
<a onclick="modifyYTiframeseektime('2671')">0:44:31</a> book the hidden life of trees you will  
<a onclick="modifyYTiframeseektime('2673')">0:44:33</a> see this  
<a onclick="modifyYTiframeseektime('2674')">0:44:34</a> what are you gonna do not have  
<a onclick="modifyYTiframeseektime('2675')">0:44:35</a> vegetables we're going to eat you're  
<a onclick="modifyYTiframeseektime('2676')">0:44:36</a> going to start sucking soil for your

<a onclick="modifyYTiframeseektime('2679')">0:44:39</a> come on man come on man what's going on  
<a onclick="modifyYTiframeseektime('2681')">0:44:41</a> guys  
<a onclick="modifyYTiframeseektime('2683')">0:44:43</a> they make these inferences so they they  
<a onclick="modifyYTiframeseektime('2685')">0:44:45</a> say  
<a onclick="modifyYTiframeseektime('2686')">0:44:46</a> but this is something that i wanted to  
<a onclick="modifyYTiframeseektime('2688')">0:44:48</a> just talk about yeah  
<a onclick="modifyYTiframeseektime('2690')">0:44:50</a> talk to them about the deep spiritual  
<a onclick="modifyYTiframeseektime('2692')">0:44:52</a> nature of sacrificing an animal  
<a onclick="modifyYTiframeseektime('2694')">0:44:54</a> i want you guys to think about this so  
<a onclick="modifyYTiframeseektime('2696')">0:44:56</a> when you have an animal  
<a onclick="modifyYTiframeseektime('2698')">0:44:58</a> and you sacrifice not just for eid but  
<a onclick="modifyYTiframeseektime('2700')">0:45:00</a> just to eat  
<a onclick="modifyYTiframeseektime('2702')">0:45:02</a> animals in islam are muslim  
<a onclick="modifyYTiframeseektime('2705')">0:45:05</a> i repeat animals in islam are  
<a onclick="modifyYTiframeseektime('2708')">0:45:08</a> muslim they submit to the will of allah  
<a onclick="modifyYTiframeseektime('2712')">0:45:12</a> they are muslim  
<a onclick="modifyYTiframeseektime('2714')">0:45:14</a> this muslim has been created  
<a onclick="modifyYTiframeseektime('2717')">0:45:17</a> obviously for the kind of biological  
<a onclick="modifyYTiframeseektime('2720')">0:45:20</a> the the the kind of environment in order  
<a onclick="modifyYTiframeseektime('2722')">0:45:22</a> for the whole  
<a onclick="modifyYTiframeseektime('2723')">0:45:23</a> cycle and of life to function and so on  
<a onclick="modifyYTiframeseektime('2726')">0:45:26</a> and so forth  
<a onclick="modifyYTiframeseektime('2726')">0:45:26</a> but they have also been created for us  
<a onclick="modifyYTiframeseektime('2728')">0:45:28</a> to eat them so what is happening here  
<a onclick="modifyYTiframeseektime('2731')">0:45:31</a> a muslim has been designed and created  
<a onclick="modifyYTiframeseektime('2734')">0:45:34</a> to be sacrificed for you to eat  
<a onclick="modifyYTiframeseektime('2736')">0:45:36</a> so that muslim submits and gives his  
<a onclick="modifyYTiframeseektime('2740')">0:45:40</a> life to this muslim  
<a onclick="modifyYTiframeseektime('2741')">0:45:41</a> myself in order for me to become  
<a onclick="modifyYTiframeseektime('2744')">0:45:44</a> stronger and worship allah  
<a onclick="modifyYTiframeseektime('2746')">0:45:46</a> that's a different way of looking at it  
<a onclick="modifyYTiframeseektime('2748')">0:45:48</a> that is a different paradigm  
<a onclick="modifyYTiframeseektime('2749')">0:45:49</a> these creatures have been created for  
<a onclick="modifyYTiframeseektime('2751')">0:45:51</a> that purpose they are muslim  
<a onclick="modifyYTiframeseektime('2753')">0:45:53</a> and they're sacrificing someone  
<a onclick="modifyYTiframeseektime('2754')">0:45:54</a> submitting themselves in order for  
<a onclick="modifyYTiframeseektime('2756')">0:45:56</a> another muslim the human being  
<a onclick="modifyYTiframeseektime('2758')">0:45:58</a> in order to consume and be grateful  
<a onclick="modifyYTiframeseektime('2761')">0:46:01</a> and to give thanks to allah and also to  
<a onclick="modifyYTiframeseektime('2763')">0:46:03</a> consume to be strong  
<a onclick="modifyYTiframeseektime('2764')">0:46:04</a> to worship allah subhanahu wa that's a  
<a onclick="modifyYTiframeseektime('2767')">0:46:07</a> different way of looking at it so  
<a onclick="modifyYTiframeseektime('2768')">0:46:08</a> just address it from a kind of  
<a onclick="modifyYTiframeseektime('2769')">0:46:09</a> philosophical perspective and an ethical  
<a onclick="modifyYTiframeseektime('2771')">0:46:11</a> one as well  
<a onclick="modifyYTiframeseektime('2772')">0:46:12</a> and uh yes so i would just for now i  
<a onclick="modifyYTiframeseektime('2775')">0:46:15</a> just ignore them just have your lamb  
<a onclick="modifyYTiframeseektime('2777')">0:46:17</a> have your beef be grateful to allah say  
<a onclick="modifyYTiframeseektime('2781')">0:46:21</a> bismillah be grateful to allah for  
<a onclick="modifyYTiframeseektime('2783')">0:46:23</a> for what he's given you if you if you're  
<a onclick="modifyYTiframeseektime('2786')">0:46:26</a> grateful to allah will give you  
<a onclick="modifyYTiframeseektime('2787')">0:46:27</a> allah will give you more allah will give  
<a onclick="modifyYTiframeseektime('2789')">0:46:29</a> you more to be grateful for and also  
<a onclick="modifyYTiframeseektime('2791')">0:46:31</a> don't forget to share it with the poor  
<a onclick="modifyYTiframeseektime('2792')">0:46:32</a> and to give sadaqa  
<a onclick="modifyYTiframeseektime('2794')">0:46:34</a> and so on and so forth so yeah i mean  
<a onclick="modifyYTiframeseektime('2797')">0:46:37</a> what's going on with the vegan stuff you  
<a onclick="modifyYTiframeseektime('2799')">0:46:39</a> have talked to me yeah so they make this  
<a onclick="modifyYTiframeseektime('2801')">0:46:41</a> inference that um  
<a onclick="modifyYTiframeseektime('2803')">0:46:43</a> well you know the the plant doesn't have  
<a onclick="modifyYTiframeseektime('2805')">0:46:45</a> a nervous system  
<a onclick="modifyYTiframeseektime('2806')">0:46:46</a> so therefore it can't feel pain but it's  
<a onclick="modifyYTiframeseektime('2808')">0:46:48</a> like well there's lots of things plants  
<a onclick="modifyYTiframeseektime('2809')">0:46:49</a> seem to be able to do without  
<a onclick="modifyYTiframeseektime('2811')">0:46:51</a> the exact same apparatus as we do for  
<a onclick="modifyYTiframeseektime('2813')">0:46:53</a> example they have a form of respiration  
<a onclick="modifyYTiframeseektime('2815')">0:46:55</a> but they don't have lungs  
<a onclick="modifyYTiframeseektime('2816')">0:46:56</a> they some plants have the ability to  
<a onclick="modifyYTiframeseektime('2819')">0:46:59</a> have a  
<a onclick="modifyYTiframeseektime('2820')">0:47:00</a> a rudimentary form of memory although  
<a onclick="modifyYTiframeseektime('2823')">0:47:03</a> they don't have brains  
<a onclick="modifyYTiframeseektime('2824')">0:47:04</a> they communicate although they don't  
<a onclick="modifyYTiframeseektime('2825')">0:47:05</a> have mouths and tongues yeah but you  
<a onclick="modifyYTiframeseektime('2826')">0:47:06</a> said  
<a onclick="modifyYTiframeseektime('2827')">0:47:07</a> a lot of these vegans are usually  
<a onclick="modifyYTiframeseektime('2828')">0:47:08</a> atheists right and with all due respect  
<a onclick="modifyYTiframeseektime('2830')">0:47:10</a> under your world view it's all reduced  
<a onclick="modifyYTiframeseektime('2832')">0:47:12</a> to what  
<a onclick="modifyYTiframeseektime('2833')">0:47:13</a> is reduced to blind processes  
<a onclick="modifyYTiframeseektime('2837')">0:47:17</a> like these are electrons whizzing around  
<a onclick="modifyYTiframeseektime('2838')">0:47:18</a> they're just physical processes that are  
<a onclick="modifyYTiframeseektime('2840')">0:47:20</a> basically blind and unconscious  
<a onclick="modifyYTiframeseektime('2842')">0:47:22</a> they're blind there's no intentional  
<a onclick="modifyYTiframeseektime('2843')">0:47:23</a> force directing them anywhere and  
<a onclick="modifyYTiframeseektime('2844')">0:47:24</a> they're blind meaning they're not aware  
<a onclick="modifyYTiframeseektime('2845')">0:47:25</a> of themselves or wearing anything  
<a onclick="modifyYTiframeseektime('2847')">0:47:27</a> outside of themselves so your whole the  
<a onclick="modifyYTiframeseektime('2849')">0:47:29</a> whole physical  
<a onclick="modifyYTiframeseektime('2850')">0:47:30</a> world including animals and plants are  
<a onclick="modifyYTiframeseektime('2852')">0:47:32</a> just reduced to blind non-conscious  
<a onclick="modifyYTiframeseektime('2854')">0:47:34</a> things  
<a onclick="modifyYTiframeseektime('2855')">0:47:35</a> i'm just gonna say good night to my  
<a onclick="modifyYTiframeseektime('2856')">0:47:36</a> daughter i'll be back in a sec no  
<a onclick="modifyYTiframeseektime('2858')">0:47:38</a> problem  
<a onclick="modifyYTiframeseektime('2859')">0:47:39</a> even even with your own perspective uh  
<a onclick="modifyYTiframeseektime('2862')">0:47:42</a> do you have a philosophical grounding to  
<a onclick="modifyYTiframeseektime('2864')">0:47:44</a> even justify things like  
<a onclick="modifyYTiframeseektime('2865')">0:47:45</a> oh this is objectively wrong and this is  
<a onclick="modifyYTiframeseektime('2867')">0:47:47</a> objectively uh  
<a onclick="modifyYTiframeseektime('2868')">0:47:48</a> you know you know it's it's you know  
<a onclick="modifyYTiframeseektime('2871')">0:47:51</a> it's we value these things what does  
<a onclick="modifyYTiframeseektime('2873')">0:47:53</a> value mean  
<a onclick="modifyYTiframeseektime('2873')">0:47:53</a> according to your world view anyway it's  
<a onclick="modifyYTiframeseektime('2875')">0:47:55</a> reduced to blind non-conscious physical  
<a onclick="modifyYTiframeseektime('2877')">0:47:57</a> processes  
<a onclick="modifyYTiframeseektime('2879')">0:47:59</a> with all due respect so um it doesn't  
<a onclick="modifyYTiframeseektime('2881')">0:48:01</a> give you a grounding  
<a onclick="modifyYTiframeseektime('2882')">0:48:02</a> for your your your your value system  
<a onclick="modifyYTiframeseektime('2886')">0:48:06</a> from that perspective so let's now have  
<a onclick="modifyYTiframeseektime('2892')">0:48:12</a> uh someone else on borders have someone  
<a onclick="modifyYTiframeseektime('2894')">0:48:14</a> salaam alaikum  
<a onclick="modifyYTiframeseektime('2898')">0:48:18</a> s  
<a onclick="modifyYTiframeseektime('2906')">0:48:26</a> this is for the third time for me that i  
<a onclick="modifyYTiframeseektime('2909')">0:48:29</a> have been joining with you guys  
<a onclick="modifyYTiframeseektime('2910')">0:48:30</a> and probably you guys were  
<a onclick="modifyYTiframeseektime('2914')">0:48:34</a> you guys were doing lives into ramadan  
<a onclick="modifyYTiframeseektime('2917')">0:48:37</a> and i have basically two questions  
<a onclick="modifyYTiframeseektime('2919')">0:48:39</a> uh the first one that i'm going to ask  
<a onclick="modifyYTiframeseektime('2921')">0:48:41</a> now this is something that you know  
<a onclick="modifyYTiframeseektime('2924')">0:48:44</a> uh that has been reeling i mean i have  
<a onclick="modifyYTiframeseektime('2927')">0:48:47</a> been  
<a onclick="modifyYTiframeseektime('2928')">0:48:48</a> reeling on the same question for quite a  
<a onclick="modifyYTiframeseektime('2930')">0:48:50</a> few times actually but i'm just trying  
<a onclick="modifyYTiframeseektime('2932')">0:48:52</a> to get to that i'm just  
<a onclick="modifyYTiframeseektime('2933')">0:48:53</a> trying to get to the key of it because  
<a onclick="modifyYTiframeseektime('2936')">0:48:56</a> i'm also  
<a onclick="modifyYTiframeseektime('2938')">0:48:58</a> i mean not only to the others i'm also  
<a onclick="modifyYTiframeseektime('2940')">0:49:00</a> asking this to myself the question is  
<a onclick="modifyYTiframeseektime('2944')">0:49:04</a> what our iman should be contingent upon  
<a onclick="modifyYTiframeseektime('2947')">0:49:07</a> because first of all let me tell you  
<a onclick="modifyYTiframeseektime('2948')">0:49:08</a> something because when for the first  
<a onclick="modifyYTiframeseektime('2950')">0:49:10</a> time i  
<a onclick="modifyYTiframeseektime('2950')">0:49:10</a> asked this question it was that  
<a onclick="modifyYTiframeseektime('2954')">0:49:14</a> uh how do we determine truth  
<a onclick="modifyYTiframeseektime('2958')">0:49:18</a> or what right on the basis of what  
<a onclick="modifyYTiframeseektime('2960')">0:49:20</a> criteria do we determine the truth  
<a onclick="modifyYTiframeseektime('2963')">0:49:23</a> and i was uh having a discussion with  
<a onclick="modifyYTiframeseektime('2966')">0:49:26</a> uh subur ahmed in the ramadan and he  
<a onclick="modifyYTiframeseektime('2968')">0:49:28</a> told me that  
<a onclick="modifyYTiframeseektime('2970')">0:49:30</a> it's it should be based upon our own  
<a onclick="modifyYTiframeseektime('2971')">0:49:31</a> reasoning so  
<a onclick="modifyYTiframeseektime('2973')">0:49:33</a> i was quite convinced for a period of  
<a onclick="modifyYTiframeseektime('2976')">0:49:36</a> time  
<a onclick="modifyYTiframeseektime('2976')">0:49:36</a> uh i got uh you know pretty much  
<a onclick="modifyYTiframeseektime('2979')">0:49:39</a> satisfactory  
<a onclick="modifyYTiframeseektime('2980')">0:49:40</a> answer from there but later on that i  
<a onclick="modifyYTiframeseektime('2983')">0:49:43</a> came to understand that  
<a onclick="modifyYTiframeseektime('2985')">0:49:45</a> our reasoning is something that yes you  
<a onclick="modifyYTiframeseektime('2987')">0:49:47</a> know  
<a onclick="modifyYTiframeseektime('2989')">0:49:49</a> what we determine something to be true  
<a onclick="modifyYTiframeseektime('2991')">0:49:51</a> or false that is  
<a onclick="modifyYTiframeseektime('2992')">0:49:52</a> entirely based on our own reasoning but  
<a onclick="modifyYTiframeseektime('2994')">0:49:54</a> the thing is our own reasoning is not  
<a onclick="modifyYTiframeseektime('2996')">0:49:56</a> always  
<a onclick="modifyYTiframeseektime('2996')">0:49:56</a> perfect and our reasoning is something i  
<a onclick="modifyYTiframeseektime('2999')">0:49:59</a> mean what i came to realize for  
<a onclick="modifyYTiframeseektime('3001')">0:50:01</a> uh you know within past few days  
<a onclick="modifyYTiframeseektime('3005')">0:50:05</a> that uh truth is something  
<a onclick="modifyYTiframeseektime('3008')">0:50:08</a> which is self-sufficient and we with the  
<a onclick="modifyYTiframeseektime('3012')">0:50:12</a> ability that we have we we can rather  
<a onclick="modifyYTiframeseektime('3015')">0:50:15</a> try to reach up to the truth so  
<a onclick="modifyYTiframeseektime('3018')">0:50:18</a> you know i think the basic question it  
<a onclick="modifyYTiframeseektime('3020')">0:50:20</a> comes down to the  
<a onclick="modifyYTiframeseektime('3022')">0:50:22</a> you know thought that what our iman  
<a onclick="modifyYTiframeseektime('3024')">0:50:24</a> should be contingent upon  
<a onclick="modifyYTiframeseektime('3027')">0:50:27</a> okay so everyone over squad well there's  
<a onclick="modifyYTiframeseektime('3030')">0:50:30</a> a few things here that we need to unpack  
<a onclick="modifyYTiframeseektime('3032')">0:50:32</a> because there's a lot to unpack here  
<a onclick="modifyYTiframeseektime('3033')">0:50:33</a> brother yeah so the first thing we turn  
<a onclick="modifyYTiframeseektime('3035')">0:50:35</a> back  
<a onclick="modifyYTiframeseektime('3035')">0:50:35</a> is our iman is contingent on the  
<a onclick="modifyYTiframeseektime('3039')">0:50:39</a> guidance of allah  
<a onclick="modifyYTiframeseektime('3040')">0:50:40</a> you could be totally irrational and have  
<a onclick="modifyYTiframeseektime('3043')">0:50:43</a> iman  
<a onclick="modifyYTiframeseektime('3044')">0:50:44</a> okay  
<a onclick="modifyYTiframeseektime('3047')">0:50:47</a> irrational from a kind of you know  
<a onclick="modifyYTiframeseektime('3049')">0:50:49</a> abstract sense  
<a onclick="modifyYTiframeseektime('3050')">0:50:50</a> you need to realize that if allah  
<a onclick="modifyYTiframeseektime('3053')">0:50:53</a> decides to guide someone  
<a onclick="modifyYTiframeseektime('3055')">0:50:55</a> then what ever type of rationale you  
<a onclick="modifyYTiframeseektime('3057')">0:50:57</a> throw at them  
<a onclick="modifyYTiframeseektime('3058')">0:50:58</a> to try and prove them wrong or whatever  
<a onclick="modifyYTiframeseektime('3060')">0:51:00</a> you throw at them  
<a onclick="modifyYTiframeseektime('3061')">0:51:01</a> they're going to remain guided and if  
<a onclick="modifyYTiframeseektime('3063')">0:51:03</a> allah decides to misguide someone  
<a onclick="modifyYTiframeseektime('3065')">0:51:05</a> even if they seem to be the most  
<a onclick="modifyYTiframeseektime('3066')">0:51:06</a> intelligent human being and they have  
<a onclick="modifyYTiframeseektime('3067')">0:51:07</a> the great critical thinking skills and  
<a onclick="modifyYTiframeseektime('3069')">0:51:09</a> so on and so forth  
<a onclick="modifyYTiframeseektime('3070')">0:51:10</a> then they're going to be misguided  
<a onclick="modifyYTiframeseektime('3072')">0:51:12</a> that's the that's actually a very  
<a onclick="modifyYTiframeseektime('3074')">0:51:14</a> important point you need to understand  
<a onclick="modifyYTiframeseektime('3075')">0:51:15</a> because this actually dictates  
<a onclick="modifyYTiframeseektime('3076')">0:51:16</a> everything else  
<a onclick="modifyYTiframeseektime('3077')">0:51:17</a> so you have to understand that guidance  
<a onclick="modifyYTiframeseektime('3079')">0:51:19</a> accepting the truth  
<a onclick="modifyYTiframeseektime('3081')">0:51:21</a> and what do you mean by truth here we  
<a onclick="modifyYTiframeseektime('3083')">0:51:23</a> mean the representation  
<a onclick="modifyYTiframeseektime('3085')">0:51:25</a> of the actual state of affairs  
<a onclick="modifyYTiframeseektime('3088')">0:51:28</a> we understand reality  
<a onclick="modifyYTiframeseektime('3091')">0:51:31</a> it is our our beliefs  
<a onclick="modifyYTiframeseektime('3095')">0:51:35</a> our propositions our representations of  
<a onclick="modifyYTiframeseektime('3098')">0:51:38</a> reality our representations of the  
<a onclick="modifyYTiframeseektime('3100')">0:51:40</a> actual state of affairs  
<a onclick="modifyYTiframeseektime('3102')">0:51:42</a> so when we say this means there is no  
<a onclick="modifyYTiframeseektime('3105')">0:51:45</a> deity where they worship  
<a onclick="modifyYTiframeseektime('3106')">0:51:46</a> except allah that statement that we  
<a onclick="modifyYTiframeseektime('3109')">0:51:49</a> internalize and actualize  
<a onclick="modifyYTiframeseektime('3110')">0:51:50</a> is a representation of the greatest  
<a onclick="modifyYTiframeseektime('3113')">0:51:53</a> reality  
<a onclick="modifyYTiframeseektime('3114')">0:51:54</a> because it is the greatest reality to  
<a onclick="modifyYTiframeseektime('3116')">0:51:56</a> understand that there is a deity that is  
<a onclick="modifyYTiframeseektime('3118')">0:51:58</a> worthy of worship  
<a onclick="modifyYTiframeseektime('3119')">0:51:59</a> okay so when we say truth it's a  
<a onclick="modifyYTiframeseektime('3121')">0:52:01</a> representation of the actual state of  
<a onclick="modifyYTiframeseektime('3123')">0:52:03</a> affairs  
<a onclick="modifyYTiframeseektime('3124')">0:52:04</a> so i've got a bit sidetracked but the  
<a onclick="modifyYTiframeseektime('3127')">0:52:07</a> point i'm trying to say here is  
<a onclick="modifyYTiframeseektime('3129')">0:52:09</a> that the first thing you need to  
<a onclick="modifyYTiframeseektime('3130')">0:52:10</a> understand is guidance and misguidance  
<a onclick="modifyYTiframeseektime('3132')">0:52:12</a> the hands of what what's up what to add  
<a onclick="modifyYTiframeseektime('3135')">0:52:15</a> now they can be ways to truth  
<a onclick="modifyYTiframeseektime('3138')">0:52:18</a> okay so to establish the truth and what  
<a onclick="modifyYTiframeseektime('3140')">0:52:20</a> i mean by truth here is talk about la  
<a onclick="modifyYTiframeseektime('3142')">0:52:22</a> illaha illallah okay we could talk about  
<a onclick="modifyYTiframeseektime('3144')">0:52:24</a> other things like you know  
<a onclick="modifyYTiframeseektime('3146')">0:52:26</a> find out how the brain works and how do  
<a onclick="modifyYTiframeseektime('3148')">0:52:28</a> you know you know  
<a onclick="modifyYTiframeseektime('3150')">0:52:30</a> the process of embryology these things  
<a onclick="modifyYTiframeseektime('3152')">0:52:32</a> have put you have yeah  
<a onclick="modifyYTiframeseektime('3154')">0:52:34</a> i guess that is the you know biggest  
<a onclick="modifyYTiframeseektime('3156')">0:52:36</a> question and the ultimate question  
<a onclick="modifyYTiframeseektime('3158')">0:52:38</a> yeah absolutely so let's focus on that  
<a onclick="modifyYTiframeseektime('3160')">0:52:40</a> then so  
<a onclick="modifyYTiframeseektime('3161')">0:52:41</a> there are different so different means  
<a onclick="modifyYTiframeseektime('3163')">0:52:43</a> to establish that okay  
<a onclick="modifyYTiframeseektime('3164')">0:52:44</a> now if you understood what we said in  
<a onclick="modifyYTiframeseektime('3166')">0:52:46</a> the beginning concerning the kind of  
<a onclick="modifyYTiframeseektime('3167')">0:52:47</a> metaphysical backdrop that every human  
<a onclick="modifyYTiframeseektime('3169')">0:52:49</a> being has a fit  
<a onclick="modifyYTiframeseektime('3170')">0:52:50</a> has innate disposition the kind of  
<a onclick="modifyYTiframeseektime('3172')">0:52:52</a> normative primordial original state  
<a onclick="modifyYTiframeseektime('3175')">0:52:55</a> that basically either has knowledge  
<a onclick="modifyYTiframeseektime('3177')">0:52:57</a> within itself or it  
<a onclick="modifyYTiframeseektime('3179')">0:52:59</a> directs you towards the truth  
<a onclick="modifyYTiframeseektime('3182')">0:53:02</a> if it's unclouded but a lot of people  
<a onclick="modifyYTiframeseektime('3185')">0:53:05</a> have their fits were clouded  
<a onclick="modifyYTiframeseektime('3186')">0:53:06</a> so there are different means to uncloud  
<a onclick="modifyYTiframeseektime('3189')">0:53:09</a> the fitzwa  
<a onclick="modifyYTiframeseektime('3190')">0:53:10</a> to get you to realize that truth one of  
<a onclick="modifyYTiframeseektime('3192')">0:53:12</a> those means  
<a onclick="modifyYTiframeseektime('3193')">0:53:13</a> can be rational arguments another one  
<a onclick="modifyYTiframeseektime('3196')">0:53:16</a> could be  
<a onclick="modifyYTiframeseektime('3196')">0:53:16</a> just direct revelation okay so it's not  
<a onclick="modifyYTiframeseektime('3200')">0:53:20</a> entirely true that it's an abstract form  
<a onclick="modifyYTiframeseektime('3203')">0:53:23</a> of reasoning that would lead you to the  
<a onclick="modifyYTiframeseektime('3204')">0:53:24</a> truth  
<a onclick="modifyYTiframeseektime('3205')">0:53:25</a> but it is true that a sound  
<a onclick="modifyYTiframeseektime('3208')">0:53:28</a> application of reason may lead you to  
<a onclick="modifyYTiframeseektime('3211')">0:53:31</a> the truth  
<a onclick="modifyYTiframeseektime('3212')">0:53:32</a> but you have to understand this in the  
<a onclick="modifyYTiframeseektime('3214')">0:53:34</a> context of the metaphysical backdrop  
<a onclick="modifyYTiframeseektime('3216')">0:53:36</a> because the intellect and the islamic  
<a onclick="modifyYTiframeseektime('3218')">0:53:38</a> tradition  
<a onclick="modifyYTiframeseektime('3219')">0:53:39</a> is a function of the pulp is a function  
<a onclick="modifyYTiframeseektime('3222')">0:53:42</a> of the heart  
<a onclick="modifyYTiframeseektime('3222')">0:53:42</a> and what does the heart do the heart  
<a onclick="modifyYTiframeseektime('3224')">0:53:44</a> does  
<a onclick="modifyYTiframeseektime('3226')">0:53:46</a> it wavers but the intellect is within it  
<a onclick="modifyYTiframeseektime('3230')">0:53:50</a> and also there is a dynamic interplay  
<a onclick="modifyYTiframeseektime('3231')">0:53:51</a> between the nufs the ego  
<a onclick="modifyYTiframeseektime('3233')">0:53:53</a> and between the spiritual diseases of  
<a onclick="modifyYTiframeseektime('3235')">0:53:55</a> the heart and maybe the fitting of the  
<a onclick="modifyYTiframeseektime('3237')">0:53:57</a> heart like shubu heart and shahawat  
<a onclick="modifyYTiframeseektime('3239')">0:53:59</a> destructive doubts  
<a onclick="modifyYTiframeseektime('3240')">0:54:00</a> and blaming blame where he desires and  
<a onclick="modifyYTiframeseektime('3242')">0:54:02</a> so on and so forth  
<a onclick="modifyYTiframeseektime('3243')">0:54:03</a> so it's not as simple as saying if you  
<a onclick="modifyYTiframeseektime('3245')">0:54:05</a> have sound reasoning  
<a onclick="modifyYTiframeseektime('3246')">0:54:06</a> you're going to be guided no because you  
<a onclick="modifyYTiframeseektime('3248')">0:54:08</a> may have sound reasoning but  
<a onclick="modifyYTiframeseektime('3250')">0:54:10</a> your heart you may have ego so your  
<a onclick="modifyYTiframeseektime('3253')">0:54:13</a> sound reasoning may be saying  
<a onclick="modifyYTiframeseektime('3254')">0:54:14</a> this is the truth this is the actual  
<a onclick="modifyYTiframeseektime('3256')">0:54:16</a> this is the representation of affairs  
<a onclick="modifyYTiframeseektime('3258')">0:54:18</a> this is reality but your heart  
<a onclick="modifyYTiframeseektime('3262')">0:54:22</a> may have the spiritual disease of kibber  
<a onclick="modifyYTiframeseektime('3265')">0:54:25</a> of arrogance  
<a onclick="modifyYTiframeseektime('3266')">0:54:26</a> and you the arrogance could be blocking  
<a onclick="modifyYTiframeseektime('3268')">0:54:28</a> the function of the heart which is the  
<a onclick="modifyYTiframeseektime('3271')">0:54:31</a> right so it's not as simple as saying  
<a onclick="modifyYTiframeseektime('3274')">0:54:34</a> reason would lead you to that right  
<a onclick="modifyYTiframeseektime('3276')">0:54:36</a> do you understand what i'm saying so far  
<a onclick="modifyYTiframeseektime('3278')">0:54:38</a> yeah  
<a onclick="modifyYTiframeseektime('3279')">0:54:39</a> i totally understand and actually my  
<a onclick="modifyYTiframeseektime('3281')">0:54:41</a> next question is also  
<a onclick="modifyYTiframeseektime('3282')">0:54:42</a> about fitna that is that yeah but this  
<a onclick="modifyYTiframeseektime('3285')">0:54:45</a> is in line with even western cognitive  
<a onclick="modifyYTiframeseektime('3286')">0:54:46</a> psychology  
<a onclick="modifyYTiframeseektime('3287')">0:54:47</a> because they even they you know it's  
<a onclick="modifyYTiframeseektime('3289')">0:54:49</a> immature to say that we're just abstract  
<a onclick="modifyYTiframeseektime('3291')">0:54:51</a> rational beings we're not  
<a onclick="modifyYTiframeseektime('3292')">0:54:52</a> there is a cognitive psychological  
<a onclick="modifyYTiframeseektime('3294')">0:54:54</a> reality some people like for example in  
<a onclick="modifyYTiframeseektime('3296')">0:54:56</a> cognitive science  
<a onclick="modifyYTiframeseektime('3297')">0:54:57</a> you research this for yourself people  
<a onclick="modifyYTiframeseektime('3299')">0:54:59</a> would think they're rational they have a  
<a onclick="modifyYTiframeseektime('3301')">0:55:01</a> rational belief  
<a onclick="modifyYTiframeseektime('3302')">0:55:02</a> but it wasn't because of any type of  
<a onclick="modifyYTiframeseektime('3304')">0:55:04</a> reason part of it was because of maybe  
<a onclick="modifyYTiframeseektime('3306')">0:55:06</a> psychosocial motivations that they  
<a onclick="modifyYTiframeseektime('3308')">0:55:08</a> weren't even aware of  
<a onclick="modifyYTiframeseektime('3309')">0:55:09</a> right so yeah this is something very  
<a onclick="modifyYTiframeseektime('3312')">0:55:12</a> important for us to understand so when  
<a onclick="modifyYTiframeseektime('3313')">0:55:13</a> we understand the human being as allah  
<a onclick="modifyYTiframeseektime('3315')">0:55:15</a> create the human being  
<a onclick="modifyYTiframeseektime('3316')">0:55:16</a> and we understand the role of the fitra  
<a onclick="modifyYTiframeseektime('3318')">0:55:18</a> and the quran  
<a onclick="modifyYTiframeseektime('3321')">0:55:21</a> that there can be different means to  
<a onclick="modifyYTiframeseektime('3322')">0:55:22</a> that truth yes one of them could be a  
<a onclick="modifyYTiframeseektime('3325')">0:55:25</a> sound  
<a onclick="modifyYTiframeseektime('3326')">0:55:26</a> reasoning sound rationality but it's in  
<a onclick="modifyYTiframeseektime('3329')">0:55:29</a> context as well  
<a onclick="modifyYTiframeseektime('3330')">0:55:30</a> where the heart is right because the  
<a onclick="modifyYTiframeseektime('3333')">0:55:33</a> heart for example  
<a onclick="modifyYTiframeseektime('3334')">0:55:34</a> could be infected with kibber if someone  
<a onclick="modifyYTiframeseektime('3337')">0:55:37</a> has a high end level of qibla  
<a onclick="modifyYTiframeseektime('3339')">0:55:39</a> they will not actualize or internalize  
<a onclick="modifyYTiframeseektime('3342')">0:55:42</a> allah  
<a onclick="modifyYTiframeseektime('3342')">0:55:42</a> they don't want a deity over them they  
<a onclick="modifyYTiframeseektime('3344')">0:55:44</a> want to be deities of themselves  
<a onclick="modifyYTiframeseektime('3345')">0:55:45</a> and this is why bro you'll have two  
<a onclick="modifyYTiframeseektime('3347')">0:55:47</a> different people  
<a onclick="modifyYTiframeseektime('3348')">0:55:48</a> with really good intellects but they'll  
<a onclick="modifyYTiframeseektime('3351')">0:55:51</a> have and the same data and they'll have  
<a onclick="modifyYTiframeseektime('3353')">0:55:53</a> drastically different conclusions why  
<a onclick="modifyYTiframeseektime('3356')">0:55:56</a> oh it's a difference of opinion they've  
<a onclick="modifyYTiframeseektime('3357')">0:55:57</a> seen it from a different perspective  
<a onclick="modifyYTiframeseektime('3359')">0:55:59</a> maybe  
<a onclick="modifyYTiframeseektime('3360')">0:56:00</a> but standing the possibility it could be  
<a onclick="modifyYTiframeseektime('3361')">0:56:01</a> where their heart is  
<a onclick="modifyYTiframeseektime('3363')">0:56:03</a> it could be where their heart lies maybe  
<a onclick="modifyYTiframeseektime('3366')">0:56:06</a> once heart is more free of qibla more  
<a onclick="modifyYTiframeseektime('3368')">0:56:08</a> free of arrogance more free of the  
<a onclick="modifyYTiframeseektime('3369')">0:56:09</a> spiritual blemishes and it allows them  
<a onclick="modifyYTiframeseektime('3371')">0:56:11</a> to see  
<a onclick="modifyYTiframeseektime('3372')">0:56:12</a> reality as it is  
<a onclick="modifyYTiframeseektime('3377')">0:56:17</a> yeah actually uh so my second question  
<a onclick="modifyYTiframeseektime('3379')">0:56:19</a> was uh about the fitra that  
<a onclick="modifyYTiframeseektime('3382')">0:56:22</a> what do i i mean what do i understand uh  
<a onclick="modifyYTiframeseektime('3385')">0:56:25</a> by fitra  
<a onclick="modifyYTiframeseektime('3386')">0:56:26</a> is that probably it is the ability  
<a onclick="modifyYTiframeseektime('3390')">0:56:30</a> of recognizing god by born i mean this  
<a onclick="modifyYTiframeseektime('3392')">0:56:32</a> is something  
<a onclick="modifyYTiframeseektime('3393')">0:56:33</a> uh an innate nature right then  
<a onclick="modifyYTiframeseektime('3396')">0:56:36</a> my question would be that how has it  
<a onclick="modifyYTiframeseektime('3398')">0:56:38</a> been explained by the prophet muhammad  
<a onclick="modifyYTiframeseektime('3399')">0:56:39</a> sallallahu alaihi  
<a onclick="modifyYTiframeseektime('3400')">0:56:40</a> because the question arises here  
<a onclick="modifyYTiframeseektime('3404')">0:56:44</a> is that if every human being  
<a onclick="modifyYTiframeseektime('3407')">0:56:47</a> are born with the fitra then why is  
<a onclick="modifyYTiframeseektime('3409')">0:56:49</a> there a necessity  
<a onclick="modifyYTiframeseektime('3410')">0:56:50</a> to you know teach them or to let them  
<a onclick="modifyYTiframeseektime('3413')">0:56:53</a> know about that there is a god or  
<a onclick="modifyYTiframeseektime('3415')">0:56:55</a> something like that i'm not talking  
<a onclick="modifyYTiframeseektime('3416')">0:56:56</a> about the rituals or  
<a onclick="modifyYTiframeseektime('3417')">0:56:57</a> how to pray or how to what what things  
<a onclick="modifyYTiframeseektime('3419')">0:56:59</a> to do or what things are not to be done  
<a onclick="modifyYTiframeseektime('3422')">0:57:02</a> but the you know recognition of the  
<a onclick="modifyYTiframeseektime('3425')">0:57:05</a> existence of god  
<a onclick="modifyYTiframeseektime('3426')">0:57:06</a> why it is necessary necessary to to be  
<a onclick="modifyYTiframeseektime('3428')">0:57:08</a> taught  
<a onclick="modifyYTiframeseektime('3430')">0:57:10</a> if it is yes well  
<a onclick="modifyYTiframeseektime('3433')">0:57:13</a> there is a difference so there's say  
<a onclick="modifyYTiframeseektime('3435')">0:57:15</a> there's two opinions of the fitzran one  
<a onclick="modifyYTiframeseektime('3436')">0:57:16</a> is that it has a form of proton or  
<a onclick="modifyYTiframeseektime('3438')">0:57:18</a> primary knowledge that allah is a  
<a onclick="modifyYTiframeseektime('3439')">0:57:19</a> reality is worthy of extensive praise  
<a onclick="modifyYTiframeseektime('3442')">0:57:22</a> and the other view of the fitra is that  
<a onclick="modifyYTiframeseektime('3443')">0:57:23</a> it's just like an affinity that directs  
<a onclick="modifyYTiframeseektime('3445')">0:57:25</a> you towards the truth  
<a onclick="modifyYTiframeseektime('3446')">0:57:26</a> so if you give the second opinion that  
<a onclick="modifyYTiframeseektime('3448')">0:57:28</a> we that you just mentioned that it's an  
<a onclick="modifyYTiframeseektime('3449')">0:57:29</a> affinity that directs you towards the  
<a onclick="modifyYTiframeseektime('3450')">0:57:30</a> truth  
<a onclick="modifyYTiframeseektime('3451')">0:57:31</a> then it the the fitter would need  
<a onclick="modifyYTiframeseektime('3453')">0:57:33</a> guiding right so if the  
<a onclick="modifyYTiframeseektime('3455')">0:57:35</a> victor is like a vehicle and is driving  
<a onclick="modifyYTiframeseektime('3457')">0:57:37</a> towards the truth  
<a onclick="modifyYTiframeseektime('3458')">0:57:38</a> if it gets clouded because of parenting  
<a onclick="modifyYTiframeseektime('3460')">0:57:40</a> and socialization  
<a onclick="modifyYTiframeseektime('3462')">0:57:42</a> as per the hadith muslim then you need  
<a onclick="modifyYTiframeseektime('3464')">0:57:44</a> to to remove some of that mist and those  
<a onclick="modifyYTiframeseektime('3466')">0:57:46</a> clouds to  
<a onclick="modifyYTiframeseektime('3467')">0:57:47</a> allow it to direct itself towards the  
<a onclick="modifyYTiframeseektime('3469')">0:57:49</a> truth so the pedagogy the way you teach  
<a onclick="modifyYTiframeseektime('3471')">0:57:51</a> your children  
<a onclick="modifyYTiframeseektime('3472')">0:57:52</a> is not to give them the calam  
<a onclick="modifyYTiframeseektime('3473')">0:57:53</a> cosmological argument without respect  
<a onclick="modifyYTiframeseektime('3475')">0:57:55</a> only your food will do that right  
<a onclick="modifyYTiframeseektime('3477')">0:57:57</a> they'll create far more confusion you  
<a onclick="modifyYTiframeseektime('3478')">0:57:58</a> don't give a seven-year-old  
<a onclick="modifyYTiframeseektime('3479')">0:57:59</a> the calam cosmological argument or the  
<a onclick="modifyYTiframeseektime('3481')">0:58:01</a> argument from consciousness of course  
<a onclick="modifyYTiframeseektime('3482')">0:58:02</a> not  
<a onclick="modifyYTiframeseektime('3483')">0:58:03</a> you would affirm what the fitra dictates  
<a onclick="modifyYTiframeseektime('3487')">0:58:07</a> you affirm and someone who has children  
<a onclick="modifyYTiframeseektime('3489')">0:58:09</a> you'll realize this  
<a onclick="modifyYTiframeseektime('3490')">0:58:10</a> so you you basically just affirm you get  
<a onclick="modifyYTiframeseektime('3492')">0:58:12</a> them to look into the cosmos and say  
<a onclick="modifyYTiframeseektime('3494')">0:58:14</a> look the stars in the moon who created  
<a onclick="modifyYTiframeseektime('3496')">0:58:16</a> that and then you had that discussion it

<a onclick="modifyYTiframeseektime('3502')">0:58:22</a> that revelation is one of the greatest

<a onclick="modifyYTiframeseektime('3509')">0:58:29</a> they are developing and obviously as  
<a onclick="modifyYTiframeseektime('3511')">0:58:31</a> they get older and they encounter other  
<a onclick="modifyYTiframeseektime('3512')">0:58:32</a> ideologies and arguments then for sure  
<a onclick="modifyYTiframeseektime('3514')">0:58:34</a> you could develop their knowledge base

<a onclick="modifyYTiframeseektime('3518')">0:58:38</a> should be the values and the principles

<a onclick="modifyYTiframeseektime('3523')">0:58:43</a> um and this is why it's very important  
<a onclick="modifyYTiframeseektime('3525')">0:58:45</a> but another thing that's important is  
<a onclick="modifyYTiframeseektime('3527')">0:58:47</a> you need to create a good relationship

<a onclick="modifyYTiframeseektime('3551')">0:59:11</a> this  
<a onclick="modifyYTiframeseektime('3552')">0:59:12</a> when you get them to sit outside of

<a onclick="modifyYTiframeseektime('3566')">0:59:26</a> comes out  
<a onclick="modifyYTiframeseektime('3567')">0:59:27</a> and they'll come up with an answer that

<a onclick="modifyYTiframeseektime('3706')">1:01:46</a> they are they are untaught meaning  
<a onclick="modifyYTiframeseektime('3708')">1:01:48</a> they're not taught by information  
<a onclick="modifyYTiframeseektime('3710')">1:01:50</a> transfer  
<a onclick="modifyYTiframeseektime('3712')">1:01:52</a> so the concept of a crew of a creator or

<a onclick="modifyYTiframeseektime('3716')">1:01:56</a> you don't teach someone that they learn

<a onclick="modifyYTiframeseektime('3720')">1:02:00</a> introspection and experience it's not  
<a onclick="modifyYTiframeseektime('3722')">1:02:02</a> via information transfer  
<a onclick="modifyYTiframeseektime('3724')">1:02:04</a> does that make sense yeah totally  
<a onclick="modifyYTiframeseektime('3727')">1:02:07</a> actually i i see the problem why why  
<a onclick="modifyYTiframeseektime('3729')">1:02:09</a> these uh problems and questions or doubt  
<a onclick="modifyYTiframeseektime('3732')">1:02:12</a> whatever you say this comes up  
<a onclick="modifyYTiframeseektime('3734')">1:02:14</a> is that you know we do not really  
<a onclick="modifyYTiframeseektime('3736')">1:02:16</a> understand or introspect on the thing  
<a onclick="modifyYTiframeseektime('3738')">1:02:18</a> that why do we believe something that we  
<a onclick="modifyYTiframeseektime('3740')">1:02:20</a> believe  
<a onclick="modifyYTiframeseektime('3741')">1:02:21</a> actually basically i am currently now  
<a onclick="modifyYTiframeseektime('3743')">1:02:23</a> studying in the university  
<a onclick="modifyYTiframeseektime('3744')">1:02:24</a> when i was a teenage boy i was used to  
<a onclick="modifyYTiframeseektime('3747')">1:02:27</a> listen to mr zakir naik and he was very  
<a onclick="modifyYTiframeseektime('3749')">1:02:29</a> he was quite expert at you know relating  
<a onclick="modifyYTiframeseektime('3752')">1:02:32</a> quran and islam with science so and  
<a onclick="modifyYTiframeseektime('3754')">1:02:34</a> being a young boy who was very much  
<a onclick="modifyYTiframeseektime('3756')">1:02:36</a> interested in scientific contentions and  
<a onclick="modifyYTiframeseektime('3758')">1:02:38</a> all that  
<a onclick="modifyYTiframeseektime('3759')">1:02:39</a> so i somehow started to believe that  
<a onclick="modifyYTiframeseektime('3761')">1:02:41</a> science or scientific methodology was  
<a onclick="modifyYTiframeseektime('3763')">1:02:43</a> you know a way of  
<a onclick="modifyYTiframeseektime('3766')">1:02:46</a> recognizing the truth at least for the  
<a onclick="modifyYTiframeseektime('3768')">1:02:48</a> natural truth so anything that  
<a onclick="modifyYTiframeseektime('3770')">1:02:50</a> uh contradicts with science and anything  
<a onclick="modifyYTiframeseektime('3773')">1:02:53</a> that contradicts with science or  
<a onclick="modifyYTiframeseektime('3775')">1:02:55</a> uh something that is established fact  
<a onclick="modifyYTiframeseektime('3778')">1:02:58</a> that  
<a onclick="modifyYTiframeseektime('3778')">1:02:58</a> might have not been you know or  
<a onclick="modifyYTiframeseektime('3780')">1:03:00</a> something that is true so  
<a onclick="modifyYTiframeseektime('3782')">1:03:02</a> i grew up having that kind of a mindset  
<a onclick="modifyYTiframeseektime('3785')">1:03:05</a> and  
<a onclick="modifyYTiframeseektime('3787')">1:03:07</a> a few days ago actually it was the last  
<a onclick="modifyYTiframeseektime('3789')">1:03:09</a> year when i uh just just out of  
<a onclick="modifyYTiframeseektime('3791')">1:03:11</a> curiosity i was  
<a onclick="modifyYTiframeseektime('3792')">1:03:12</a> searching on the internet that the  
<a onclick="modifyYTiframeseektime('3794')">1:03:14</a> scientific errors in quran and islam  
<a onclick="modifyYTiframeseektime('3796')">1:03:16</a> something like that  
<a onclick="modifyYTiframeseektime('3797')">1:03:17</a> i knew that some uh answers were gonna  
<a onclick="modifyYTiframeseektime('3800')">1:03:20</a> come but i was just more curious to know  
<a onclick="modifyYTiframeseektime('3802')">1:03:22</a> that what islamic scholars has to say  
<a onclick="modifyYTiframeseektime('3803')">1:03:23</a> about that  
<a onclick="modifyYTiframeseektime('3804')">1:03:24</a> so when i saw that you know i i got  
<a onclick="modifyYTiframeseektime('3807')">1:03:27</a> pretty much  
<a onclick="modifyYTiframeseektime('3807')">1:03:27</a> shook having seen that oh my god islamic  
<a onclick="modifyYTiframeseektime('3811')">1:03:31</a> uh contentions sometimes might  
<a onclick="modifyYTiframeseektime('3813')">1:03:33</a> contradict the science then i  
<a onclick="modifyYTiframeseektime('3814')">1:03:34</a> got to understand that you know we  
<a onclick="modifyYTiframeseektime('3816')">1:03:36</a> cannot uh you know think within that  
<a onclick="modifyYTiframeseektime('3818')">1:03:38</a> paradigm so from there on actually i  
<a onclick="modifyYTiframeseektime('3820')">1:03:40</a> kept having this question in my mind and  
<a onclick="modifyYTiframeseektime('3822')">1:03:42</a> then what do we rely upon  
<a onclick="modifyYTiframeseektime('3824')">1:03:44</a> because science is something that cannot  
<a onclick="modifyYTiframeseektime('3826')">1:03:46</a> be  
<a onclick="modifyYTiframeseektime('3827')">1:03:47</a> used to establish truth maybe sometimes  
<a onclick="modifyYTiframeseektime('3829')">1:03:49</a> it could be  
<a onclick="modifyYTiframeseektime('3830')">1:03:50</a> but you know it is not actually simple  
<a onclick="modifyYTiframeseektime('3833')">1:03:53</a> science can be used  
<a onclick="modifyYTiframeseektime('3834')">1:03:54</a> to understand the truth of the physical  
<a onclick="modifyYTiframeseektime('3837')">1:03:57</a> world  
<a onclick="modifyYTiframeseektime('3838')">1:03:58</a> that's no problem it's it's it's  
<a onclick="modifyYTiframeseektime('3841')">1:04:01</a> the one is the best method to understand  
<a onclick="modifyYTiframeseektime('3844')">1:04:04</a> the physical world how the physical  
<a onclick="modifyYTiframeseektime('3845')">1:04:05</a> world works which in reality  
<a onclick="modifyYTiframeseektime('3847')">1:04:07</a> is looking at how allah  
<a onclick="modifyYTiframeseektime('3850')">1:04:10</a> allah manifests itself in physical  
<a onclick="modifyYTiframeseektime('3853')">1:04:13</a> reality  
<a onclick="modifyYTiframeseektime('3854')">1:04:14</a> so yeah exactly that's why we cannot  
<a onclick="modifyYTiframeseektime('3857')">1:04:17</a> defer actually  
<a onclick="modifyYTiframeseektime('3858')">1:04:18</a> you know yes  
<a onclick="modifyYTiframeseektime('3862')">1:04:22</a> now there is actually not a problem the  
<a onclick="modifyYTiframeseektime('3864')">1:04:24</a> problem becomes when  
<a onclick="modifyYTiframeseektime('3865')">1:04:25</a> we somehow take it for granted that yes  
<a onclick="modifyYTiframeseektime('3868')">1:04:28</a> scientific methodology at least for the  
<a onclick="modifyYTiframeseektime('3870')">1:04:30</a> natural phenomena what science has to  
<a onclick="modifyYTiframeseektime('3872')">1:04:32</a> say if that contradicts with any kind  
<a onclick="modifyYTiframeseektime('3874')">1:04:34</a> anything  
<a onclick="modifyYTiframeseektime('3875')">1:04:35</a> uh with the religion probably their  
<a onclick="modifyYTiframeseektime('3877')">1:04:37</a> religion is pure the false  
<a onclick="modifyYTiframeseektime('3881')">1:04:41</a> so there's a difference here he is he is  
<a onclick="modifyYTiframeseektime('3884')">1:04:44</a> what the class of scholars would say  
<a onclick="modifyYTiframeseektime('3887')">1:04:47</a> so in order to understand the physical  
<a onclick="modifyYTiframeseektime('3888')">1:04:48</a> world you use the scientific method no  
<a onclick="modifyYTiframeseektime('3890')">1:04:50</a> problem  
<a onclick="modifyYTiframeseektime('3891')">1:04:51</a> scientific method free from kind of  
<a onclick="modifyYTiframeseektime('3895')">1:04:55</a> ideological constructs philosophical  
<a onclick="modifyYTiframeseektime('3898')">1:04:58</a> naturalism assuming that there is no god  
<a onclick="modifyYTiframeseektime('3900')">1:05:00</a> you don't come to  
<a onclick="modifyYTiframeseektime('3901')">1:05:01</a> see the physical world assuming there's  
<a onclick="modifyYTiframeseektime('3902')">1:05:02</a> no god right  
<a onclick="modifyYTiframeseektime('3904')">1:05:04</a> so you don't you don't read in atheism  
<a onclick="modifyYTiframeseektime('3906')">1:05:06</a> into your into your science that would  
<a onclick="modifyYTiframeseektime('3908')">1:05:08</a> be unscientific you just look at the  
<a onclick="modifyYTiframeseektime('3909')">1:05:09</a> physical world and you see how it works  
<a onclick="modifyYTiframeseektime('3912')">1:05:12</a> so i totally understand that because you  
<a onclick="modifyYTiframeseektime('3913')">1:05:13</a> know i also started something  
<a onclick="modifyYTiframeseektime('3916')">1:05:16</a> sorry sorry you probably you just your  
<a onclick="modifyYTiframeseektime('3918')">1:05:18</a> voice came up  
<a onclick="modifyYTiframeseektime('3920')">1:05:20</a> oh sorry i just mean so basically  
<a onclick="modifyYTiframeseektime('3924')">1:05:24</a> you have the scientific method as a  
<a onclick="modifyYTiframeseektime('3926')">1:05:26</a> general rule  
<a onclick="modifyYTiframeseektime('3928')">1:05:28</a> well-confirmed scientific theories that  
<a onclick="modifyYTiframeseektime('3931')">1:05:31</a> are successful  
<a onclick="modifyYTiframeseektime('3931')">1:05:31</a> that have predictive power you accept  
<a onclick="modifyYTiframeseektime('3934')">1:05:34</a> them you accept them so any welcome film  
<a onclick="modifyYTiframeseektime('3937')">1:05:37</a> theory that has predicted power this has  
<a onclick="modifyYTiframeseektime('3939')">1:05:39</a> a high  
<a onclick="modifyYTiframeseektime('3939')">1:05:39</a> epistemic status in the scientific  
<a onclick="modifyYTiframeseektime('3942')">1:05:42</a> community  
<a onclick="modifyYTiframeseektime('3943')">1:05:43</a> there's no such thing as just a theory  
<a onclick="modifyYTiframeseektime('3945')">1:05:45</a> right it's not just a theory  
<a onclick="modifyYTiframeseektime('3946')">1:05:46</a> theory science is a well-confirmed uh  
<a onclick="modifyYTiframeseektime('3949')">1:05:49</a> successful theory that has predictive  
<a onclick="modifyYTiframeseektime('3951')">1:05:51</a> power so you as a default position you  
<a onclick="modifyYTiframeseektime('3953')">1:05:53</a> accept it  
<a onclick="modifyYTiframeseektime('3954')">1:05:54</a> and islam allows you to accept it  
<a onclick="modifyYTiframeseektime('3957')">1:05:57</a> here's here's where you need some  
<a onclick="modifyYTiframeseektime('3959')">1:05:59</a> understanding  
<a onclick="modifyYTiframeseektime('3961')">1:06:01</a> if and only if there is a scientific  
<a onclick="modifyYTiframeseektime('3963')">1:06:03</a> theory that's well confirmed with  
<a onclick="modifyYTiframeseektime('3965')">1:06:05</a> predictive power and  
<a onclick="modifyYTiframeseektime('3966')">1:06:06</a> successful if it somehow contradicts  
<a onclick="modifyYTiframeseektime('3969')">1:06:09</a> islam irreconcilably meaning there is no  
<a onclick="modifyYTiframeseektime('3972')">1:06:12</a> reconciliation  
<a onclick="modifyYTiframeseektime('3974')">1:06:14</a> then what you can do you could still  
<a onclick="modifyYTiframeseektime('3976')">1:06:16</a> accept the theory practically  
<a onclick="modifyYTiframeseektime('3979')">1:06:19</a> but you accept what islam says why  
<a onclick="modifyYTiframeseektime('3981')">1:06:21</a> because  
<a onclick="modifyYTiframeseektime('3982')">1:06:22</a> if you believe in islam you know it has  
<a onclick="modifyYTiframeseektime('3983')">1:06:23</a> a higher epistemic status  
<a onclick="modifyYTiframeseektime('3986')">1:06:26</a> than the scientific method because even  
<a onclick="modifyYTiframeseektime('3989')">1:06:29</a> a will confirm theory that has  
<a onclick="modifyYTiframeseektime('3990')">1:06:30</a> predictive power and that's successful  
<a onclick="modifyYTiframeseektime('3992')">1:06:32</a> even if you're a scientific realist or  
<a onclick="modifyYTiframeseektime('3994')">1:06:34</a> an anti-realist or an instrumentalist  
<a onclick="modifyYTiframeseektime('3996')">1:06:36</a> you're still gonna affirm that  
<a onclick="modifyYTiframeseektime('3999')">1:06:39</a> it could be false and it can change  
<a onclick="modifyYTiframeseektime('4002')">1:06:42</a> right even realists believe in this  
<a onclick="modifyYTiframeseektime('4004')">1:06:44</a> they believe yes it could be even though  
<a onclick="modifyYTiframeseektime('4006')">1:06:46</a> we believe what confirm theories are  
<a onclick="modifyYTiframeseektime('4009')">1:06:49</a> a representation of the actual state of  
<a onclick="modifyYTiframeseektime('4010')">1:06:50</a> affairs they could be false and they  
<a onclick="modifyYTiframeseektime('4012')">1:06:52</a> could change  
<a onclick="modifyYTiframeseektime('4013')">1:06:53</a> given that then you know if there's an  
<a onclick="modifyYTiframeseektime('4016')">1:06:56</a> irreconcilable contradiction with islam  
<a onclick="modifyYTiframeseektime('4018')">1:06:58</a> you still accept the theory because it's  
<a onclick="modifyYTiframeseektime('4020')">1:07:00</a> working and it's giving you some  
<a onclick="modifyYTiframeseektime('4021')">1:07:01</a> positive things from a practical point  
<a onclick="modifyYTiframeseektime('4022')">1:07:02</a> of view  
<a onclick="modifyYTiframeseektime('4023')">1:07:03</a> but you don't accept it you are either  
<a onclick="modifyYTiframeseektime('4025')">1:07:05</a> because you know it's not necessarily  
<a onclick="modifyYTiframeseektime('4026')">1:07:06</a> true that just because something works  
<a onclick="modifyYTiframeseektime('4028')">1:07:08</a> is true  
<a onclick="modifyYTiframeseektime('4029')">1:07:09</a> and you accept islam what islam says but  
<a onclick="modifyYTiframeseektime('4032')">1:07:12</a> you still work with it with the theory  
<a onclick="modifyYTiframeseektime('4034')">1:07:14</a> practically but that's if and only if a  
<a onclick="modifyYTiframeseektime('4037')">1:07:17</a> well-confirmed theory that is successful  
<a onclick="modifyYTiframeseektime('4040')">1:07:20</a> cannot be reconciled with is anything  
<a onclick="modifyYTiframeseektime('4042')">1:07:22</a> that islam says and that is extremely  
<a onclick="modifyYTiframeseektime('4044')">1:07:24</a> rare  
<a onclick="modifyYTiframeseektime('4045')">1:07:25</a> i don't think there is anything in  
<a onclick="modifyYTiframeseektime('4047')">1:07:27</a> science  
<a onclick="modifyYTiframeseektime('4048')">1:07:28</a> that goes against uh islam  
<a onclick="modifyYTiframeseektime('4051')">1:07:31</a> that cannot be reconciled even  
<a onclick="modifyYTiframeseektime('4056')">1:07:36</a> even when people say darwinism the  
<a onclick="modifyYTiframeseektime('4057')">1:07:37</a> darwinian mechanism that darwinism  
<a onclick="modifyYTiframeseektime('4060')">1:07:40</a> it believes in common ancestry and and  
<a onclick="modifyYTiframeseektime('4062')">1:07:42</a> scientists they believe common ancestry  
<a onclick="modifyYTiframeseektime('4065')">1:07:45</a> is almost equivalent to the earth being  
<a onclick="modifyYTiframeseektime('4067')">1:07:47</a> round or  
<a onclick="modifyYTiframeseektime('4068')">1:07:48</a> for basically um uh heliocentrism okay  
<a onclick="modifyYTiframeseektime('4073')">1:07:53</a> yeah right  
<a onclick="modifyYTiframeseektime('4078')">1:07:58</a> didn't have parents there is no common  
<a onclick="modifyYTiframeseektime('4080')">1:08:00</a> ancestry  
<a onclick="modifyYTiframeseektime('4082')">1:08:02</a> we agree adam islam did not have parents  
<a onclick="modifyYTiframeseektime('4084')">1:08:04</a> he was created by allah  
<a onclick="modifyYTiframeseektime('4087')">1:08:07</a> but is there a way to reconcile those  
<a onclick="modifyYTiframeseektime('4090')">1:08:10</a> two different things  
<a onclick="modifyYTiframeseektime('4091')">1:08:11</a> maybe you're going to develop a theory  
<a onclick="modifyYTiframeseektime('4093')">1:08:13</a> called adamic exceptionalism  
<a onclick="modifyYTiframeseektime('4094')">1:08:14</a> maybe you're going to develop another  
<a onclick="modifyYTiframeseektime('4096')">1:08:16</a> kind of perspective the point is it's  
<a onclick="modifyYTiframeseektime('4098')">1:08:18</a> not  
<a onclick="modifyYTiframeseektime('4098')">1:08:18</a> irreconcilable yeah and what i'm saying  
<a onclick="modifyYTiframeseektime('4102')">1:08:22</a> it from the realm of orthodoxy we  
<a onclick="modifyYTiframeseektime('4104')">1:08:24</a> affirmed that adam and islam had  
<a onclick="modifyYTiframeseektime('4106')">1:08:26</a> no evolutionary foreigner had no parents  
<a onclick="modifyYTiframeseektime('4109')">1:08:29</a> allah  
<a onclick="modifyYTiframeseektime('4110')">1:08:30</a> allah created adamantium directly even  
<a onclick="modifyYTiframeseektime('4112')">1:08:32</a> the idea itself  
<a onclick="modifyYTiframeseektime('4114')">1:08:34</a> is still reconcilable it's not it's not  
<a onclick="modifyYTiframeseektime('4116')">1:08:36</a> irreconcilable that's my point  
<a onclick="modifyYTiframeseektime('4119')">1:08:39</a> so even if you talk about darwinism  
<a onclick="modifyYTiframeseektime('4120')">1:08:40</a> which is supposed to be contentious  
<a onclick="modifyYTiframeseektime('4122')">1:08:42</a> which i don't think is even contentious  
<a onclick="modifyYTiframeseektime('4123')">1:08:43</a> from that perspective  
<a onclick="modifyYTiframeseektime('4125')">1:08:45</a> it's not a major issue but if you happen  
<a onclick="modifyYTiframeseektime('4127')">1:08:47</a> hypothetically which i don't think has  
<a onclick="modifyYTiframeseektime('4128')">1:08:48</a> ever existed or will exist  
<a onclick="modifyYTiframeseektime('4130')">1:08:50</a> that there is a theory that's well  
<a onclick="modifyYTiframeseektime('4132')">1:08:52</a> confirmed and successful and it happened  
<a onclick="modifyYTiframeseektime('4133')">1:08:53</a> to  
<a onclick="modifyYTiframeseektime('4134')">1:08:54</a> be irreconcilable with an islamic or in  
<a onclick="modifyYTiframeseektime('4137')">1:08:57</a> a quranic verse then you could adopt  
<a onclick="modifyYTiframeseektime('4139')">1:08:59</a> what i've just said  
<a onclick="modifyYTiframeseektime('4140')">1:09:00</a> which is you accept what islam says  
<a onclick="modifyYTiframeseektime('4143')">1:09:03</a> because you know it's come from a higher  
<a onclick="modifyYTiframeseektime('4144')">1:09:04</a> epistemic  
<a onclick="modifyYTiframeseektime('4146')">1:09:06</a> source has a higher epistemic status and  
<a onclick="modifyYTiframeseektime('4149')">1:09:09</a> you still accept the  
<a onclick="modifyYTiframeseektime('4150')">1:09:10</a> theory practically but not in your  
<a onclick="modifyYTiframeseektime('4152')">1:09:12</a> belief because you know  
<a onclick="modifyYTiframeseektime('4153')">1:09:13</a> even in scientific realism they still  
<a onclick="modifyYTiframeseektime('4156')">1:09:16</a> believe that it can change and it could  
<a onclick="modifyYTiframeseektime('4158')">1:09:18</a> be false  
<a onclick="modifyYTiframeseektime('4158')">1:09:18</a> simple as that it's such actually an  
<a onclick="modifyYTiframeseektime('4160')">1:09:20</a> easy way of dealing with it  
<a onclick="modifyYTiframeseektime('4162')">1:09:22</a> now obviously it obviously raises the  
<a onclick="modifyYTiframeseektime('4164')">1:09:24</a> question  
<a onclick="modifyYTiframeseektime('4166')">1:09:26</a> you know oh but you have to prove that  
<a onclick="modifyYTiframeseektime('4168')">1:09:28</a> islam has a high epistemic status i  
<a onclick="modifyYTiframeseektime('4170')">1:09:30</a> agree  
<a onclick="modifyYTiframeseektime('4170')">1:09:30</a> and that's what we have to do in the  
<a onclick="modifyYTiframeseektime('4172')">1:09:32</a> dawah  
<a onclick="modifyYTiframeseektime('4174')">1:09:34</a> exactly i totally agree with you  
<a onclick="modifyYTiframeseektime('4176')">1:09:36</a> actually i do understand all the things  
<a onclick="modifyYTiframeseektime('4178')">1:09:38</a> that you have just said because i also  
<a onclick="modifyYTiframeseektime('4180')">1:09:40</a> studied  
<a onclick="modifyYTiframeseektime('4180')">1:09:40</a> science uh in my school so  
<a onclick="modifyYTiframeseektime('4184')">1:09:44</a> as i accept the fact that you know  
<a onclick="modifyYTiframeseektime('4185')">1:09:45</a> science even if science contradicts this  
<a onclick="modifyYTiframeseektime('4188')">1:09:48</a> islam and so on and so forth  
<a onclick="modifyYTiframeseektime('4190')">1:09:50</a> then i have seen people while discussing  
<a onclick="modifyYTiframeseektime('4194')">1:09:54</a> about these matters that then they ask  
<a onclick="modifyYTiframeseektime('4196')">1:09:56</a> me the question  
<a onclick="modifyYTiframeseektime('4197')">1:09:57</a> that then what is the objective proof  
<a onclick="modifyYTiframeseektime('4200')">1:10:00</a> or which could conveniently  
<a onclick="modifyYTiframeseektime('4203')">1:10:03</a> explain that islam is the truth because  
<a onclick="modifyYTiframeseektime('4206')">1:10:06</a> once i was having a conversation with  
<a onclick="modifyYTiframeseektime('4208')">1:10:08</a> some atheists and agnostics and they  
<a onclick="modifyYTiframeseektime('4210')">1:10:10</a> i asked them that what is the criteria  
<a onclick="modifyYTiframeseektime('4211')">1:10:11</a> of truth and i told them that i am a  
<a onclick="modifyYTiframeseektime('4213')">1:10:13</a> muslim  
<a onclick="modifyYTiframeseektime('4214')">1:10:14</a> and they asked me that why are you a  
<a onclick="modifyYTiframeseektime('4215')">1:10:15</a> muslim then  
<a onclick="modifyYTiframeseektime('4217')">1:10:17</a> for me actually i i tried to give some  
<a onclick="modifyYTiframeseektime('4220')">1:10:20</a> arguments and i  
<a onclick="modifyYTiframeseektime('4221')">1:10:21</a> uh told them that my criteria of  
<a onclick="modifyYTiframeseektime('4224')">1:10:24</a> establishing truth is my own reasoning  
<a onclick="modifyYTiframeseektime('4226')">1:10:26</a> and we could talk about that later but  
<a onclick="modifyYTiframeseektime('4228')">1:10:28</a> they  
<a onclick="modifyYTiframeseektime('4228')">1:10:28</a> kept asking me that why is there  
<a onclick="modifyYTiframeseektime('4232')">1:10:32</a> is there any objective evidence or way  
<a onclick="modifyYTiframeseektime('4234')">1:10:34</a> of  
<a onclick="modifyYTiframeseektime('4235')">1:10:35</a> verifying that yes islam is true or if  
<a onclick="modifyYTiframeseektime('4237')">1:10:37</a> there is any god or not  
<a onclick="modifyYTiframeseektime('4238')">1:10:38</a> so that's why actually i well that that  
<a onclick="modifyYTiframeseektime('4241')">1:10:41</a> with all due respect to be answered on  
<a onclick="modifyYTiframeseektime('4243')">1:10:43</a> this live stream comprehensively  
<a onclick="modifyYTiframeseektime('4245')">1:10:45</a> is going to take some time so what we  
<a onclick="modifyYTiframeseektime('4247')">1:10:47</a> advise you to do is we have a learning  
<a onclick="modifyYTiframeseektime('4248')">1:10:48</a> platform  
<a onclick="modifyYTiframeseektime('4250')">1:10:50</a> that's uh the the functionality is there  
<a onclick="modifyYTiframeseektime('4253')">1:10:53</a> and we've  
<a onclick="modifyYTiframeseektime('4254')">1:10:54</a> recorded around three four or five  
<a onclick="modifyYTiframeseektime('4256')">1:10:56</a> professional courses and our objective  
<a onclick="modifyYTiframeseektime('4258')">1:10:58</a> to do 10  
<a onclick="modifyYTiframeseektime('4259')">1:10:59</a> we promised last ramadan we'll have 10  
<a onclick="modifyYTiframeseektime('4261')">1:11:01</a> professional courses  
<a onclick="modifyYTiframeseektime('4262')">1:11:02</a> and that's going to include proofs of

<a onclick="modifyYTiframeseektime('4268')">1:11:08</a> it's all going to be available in our  
<a onclick="modifyYTiframeseektime('4270')">1:11:10</a> learning platform  
<a onclick="modifyYTiframeseektime('4271')">1:11:11</a> so um well we have that available in  
<a onclick="modifyYTiframeseektime('4276')">1:11:16</a> for the community and it's going to be  
<a onclick="modifyYTiframeseektime('4277')">1:11:17</a> coming up in the next couple of weeks  
<a onclick="modifyYTiframeseektime('4278')">1:11:18</a> and months when we edit it and put it up

<a onclick="modifyYTiframeseektime('4282')">1:11:22</a> but for the time being what we're going

<a onclick="modifyYTiframeseektime('4409')">1:13:29</a> a here uh we've got one comment and then

<a onclick="modifyYTiframeseektime('4413')">1:13:33</a> back i think it's a brother  
<a onclick="modifyYTiframeseektime('4414')">1:13:34</a> um so this question is very relevant uh  
<a onclick="modifyYTiframeseektime('4418')">1:13:38</a> how do we explain that allah is the most  
<a onclick="modifyYTiframeseektime('4420')">1:13:40</a> merciful and the most forgiving  
<a onclick="modifyYTiframeseektime('4422')">1:13:42</a> if he sends people to hell or hell fire  
<a onclick="modifyYTiframeseektime('4426')">1:13:46</a> well the first thing that you have to  
<a onclick="modifyYTiframeseektime('4427')">1:13:47</a> understand is that allah is not only the  
<a onclick="modifyYTiframeseektime('4428')">1:13:48</a> most merciful most forgiving he's also  
<a onclick="modifyYTiframeseektime('4430')">1:13:50</a> the most just  
<a onclick="modifyYTiframeseektime('4431')">1:13:51</a> so we understand allah's names and  
<a onclick="modifyYTiframeseektime('4432')">1:13:52</a> attributes  
<a onclick="modifyYTiframeseektime('4434')">1:13:54</a> by his oneness and we also understand  
<a onclick="modifyYTiframeseektime('4436')">1:13:56</a> allah's names and attributes by his  
<a onclick="modifyYTiframeseektime('4438')">1:13:58</a> maximum perfection  
<a onclick="modifyYTiframeseektime('4439')">1:13:59</a> what does this mean so in the islamic  
<a onclick="modifyYTiframeseektime('4441')">1:14:01</a> tradition  
<a onclick="modifyYTiframeseektime('4442')">1:14:02</a> across the schools of creed that we  
<a onclick="modifyYTiframeseektime('4444')">1:14:04</a> understand that allah's names and  
<a onclick="modifyYTiframeseektime('4445')">1:14:05</a> attributes  
<a onclick="modifyYTiframeseektime('4446')">1:14:06</a> are to the highest degree possible  
<a onclick="modifyYTiframeseektime('4448')">1:14:08</a> without any deficiency without any flaw  
<a onclick="modifyYTiframeseektime('4450')">1:14:10</a> this is  
<a onclick="modifyYTiframeseektime('4450')">1:14:10</a> maximal perfection so when we say allah  
<a onclick="modifyYTiframeseektime('4452')">1:14:12</a> is the most forgiving  
<a onclick="modifyYTiframeseektime('4454')">1:14:14</a> we're saying his forgiveness is to the  
<a onclick="modifyYTiframeseektime('4456')">1:14:16</a> highest it'd be possible now for example  
<a onclick="modifyYTiframeseektime('4459')">1:14:19</a> you know i heard for example some  
<a onclick="modifyYTiframeseektime('4460')">1:14:20</a> personal people say that  
<a onclick="modifyYTiframeseektime('4462')">1:14:22</a> oh but i'm more forgiving than allah i  
<a onclick="modifyYTiframeseektime('4464')">1:14:24</a> want some people to hell  
<a onclick="modifyYTiframeseektime('4466')">1:14:26</a> but this is what you call basically a  
<a onclick="modifyYTiframeseektime('4468')">1:14:28</a> logical fallacy because you're comparing  
<a onclick="modifyYTiframeseektime('4471')">1:14:31</a> apples and bears from that perspective  
<a onclick="modifyYTiframeseektime('4473')">1:14:33</a> because when when a human being forgives  
<a onclick="modifyYTiframeseektime('4476')">1:14:36</a> they need to forgive in some way it has  
<a onclick="modifyYTiframeseektime('4478')">1:14:38</a> an internal or an external benefit  
<a onclick="modifyYTiframeseektime('4480')">1:14:40</a> it completes them from some perspective  
<a onclick="modifyYTiframeseektime('4483')">1:14:43</a> when allah forgives  
<a onclick="modifyYTiframeseektime('4484')">1:14:44</a> he does not require anything he does not  
<a onclick="modifyYTiframeseektime('4487')">1:14:47</a> he doesn't require any completion he  
<a onclick="modifyYTiframeseektime('4489')">1:14:49</a> doesn't need anything  
<a onclick="modifyYTiframeseektime('4491')">1:14:51</a> think about this allah is the most  
<a onclick="modifyYTiframeseektime('4493')">1:14:53</a> powerful  
<a onclick="modifyYTiframeseektime('4494')">1:14:54</a> allah is he is the free  
<a onclick="modifyYTiframeseektime('4498')">1:14:58</a> he is the rich he is the independent  
<a onclick="modifyYTiframeseektime('4501')">1:15:01</a> when he forgives or when he loves he  
<a onclick="modifyYTiframeseektime('4504')">1:15:04</a> gains nothing by forgiving and nothing  
<a onclick="modifyYTiframeseektime('4506')">1:15:06</a> by loving  
<a onclick="modifyYTiframeseektime('4507')">1:15:07</a> such is allah yet he loves  
<a onclick="modifyYTiframeseektime('4510')">1:15:10</a> so when you think about allah's  
<a onclick="modifyYTiframeseektime('4511')">1:15:11</a> forgiveness it's always going to be  
<a onclick="modifyYTiframeseektime('4514')">1:15:14</a> more perfect than anyone else's  
<a onclick="modifyYTiframeseektime('4516')">1:15:16</a> forgiveness because when you forgive  
<a onclick="modifyYTiframeseektime('4517')">1:15:17</a> you need to forgive in some way it  
<a onclick="modifyYTiframeseektime('4520')">1:15:20</a> benefits you internally or externally  
<a onclick="modifyYTiframeseektime('4522')">1:15:22</a> allah does not require anything he is  
<a onclick="modifyYTiframeseektime('4525')">1:15:25</a> completely  
<a onclick="modifyYTiframeseektime('4526')">1:15:26</a> free completely rich completely  
<a onclick="modifyYTiframeseektime('4528')">1:15:28</a> independent  
<a onclick="modifyYTiframeseektime('4529')">1:15:29</a> yet he loves imagine how and he forgives  
<a onclick="modifyYTiframeseektime('4532')">1:15:32</a> imagine how pure  
<a onclick="modifyYTiframeseektime('4533')">1:15:33</a> and maximally perfect his forgiveness is  
<a onclick="modifyYTiframeseektime('4536')">1:15:36</a> that's  
<a onclick="modifyYTiframeseektime('4536')">1:15:36</a> that's that's that's uh uh uh something  
<a onclick="modifyYTiframeseektime('4539')">1:15:39</a> very important that people forget  
<a onclick="modifyYTiframeseektime('4541')">1:15:41</a> to think about for example allah's love  
<a onclick="modifyYTiframeseektime('4543')">1:15:43</a> and forgiveness and love are connected  
<a onclick="modifyYTiframeseektime('4544')">1:15:44</a> anyway  
<a onclick="modifyYTiframeseektime('4545')">1:15:45</a> he is the loving now when you think  
<a onclick="modifyYTiframeseektime('4547')">1:15:47</a> about allah's love  
<a onclick="modifyYTiframeseektime('4548')">1:15:48</a> in the context of what i've just said  
<a onclick="modifyYTiframeseektime('4550')">1:15:50</a> you understand that allah's love is to  
<a onclick="modifyYTiframeseektime('4551')">1:15:51</a> the highest  
<a onclick="modifyYTiframeseektime('4552')">1:15:52</a> degree possible without any deficiency  
<a onclick="modifyYTiframeseektime('4553')">1:15:53</a> and not any flaw think about one of the  
<a onclick="modifyYTiframeseektime('4555')">1:15:55</a> greatest manifestations of  
<a onclick="modifyYTiframeseektime('4557')">1:15:57</a> love in the dunya the one the great one  
<a onclick="modifyYTiframeseektime('4559')">1:15:59</a> of the greatest manifestations of love  
<a onclick="modifyYTiframeseektime('4561')">1:16:01</a> in the dunya is a mother's love  
<a onclick="modifyYTiframeseektime('4564')">1:16:04</a> and mother's love is nothing compared to  
<a onclick="modifyYTiframeseektime('4566')">1:16:06</a> the love of allah there is no  
<a onclick="modifyYTiframeseektime('4568')">1:16:08</a> you can't even compare with allah  
<a onclick="modifyYTiframeseektime('4570')">1:16:10</a> committee there is nothing  
<a onclick="modifyYTiframeseektime('4572')">1:16:12</a> like committee as his example  
<a onclick="modifyYTiframeseektime('4575')">1:16:15</a> don't forget there's nothing like allah  
<a onclick="modifyYTiframeseektime('4577')">1:16:17</a> there's nothing like even his example  
<a onclick="modifyYTiframeseektime('4578')">1:16:18</a> and with and with allah  
<a onclick="modifyYTiframeseektime('4580')">1:16:20</a> is the highest example so what i'm  
<a onclick="modifyYTiframeseektime('4581')">1:16:21</a> comparing but we're trying to show to  
<a onclick="modifyYTiframeseektime('4583')">1:16:23</a> you that a mother loves because she  
<a onclick="modifyYTiframeseektime('4584')">1:16:24</a> needs to love it completely in some way  
<a onclick="modifyYTiframeseektime('4587')">1:16:27</a> when allah loves he does not  
<a onclick="modifyYTiframeseektime('4589')">1:16:29</a> require completion yet he loves  
<a onclick="modifyYTiframeseektime('4593')">1:16:33</a> imagine how pure his love is from that  
<a onclick="modifyYTiframeseektime('4595')">1:16:35</a> perspective  
<a onclick="modifyYTiframeseektime('4596')">1:16:36</a> so that's why even the question is  
<a onclick="modifyYTiframeseektime('4599')">1:16:39</a> forced when someone says oh i want to do  
<a onclick="modifyYTiframeseektime('4600')">1:16:40</a> such a thing  
<a onclick="modifyYTiframeseektime('4602')">1:16:42</a> you're comparing apples and pears and  
<a onclick="modifyYTiframeseektime('4603')">1:16:43</a> you've misunderstood the reality of  
<a onclick="modifyYTiframeseektime('4604')">1:16:44</a> what's panel word to adam  
<a onclick="modifyYTiframeseektime('4606')">1:16:46</a> also we have to understand the concept  
<a onclick="modifyYTiframeseektime('4608')">1:16:48</a> of hell here i've mentioned this earlier  
<a onclick="modifyYTiframeseektime('4609')">1:16:49</a> i don't know if you were around  
<a onclick="modifyYTiframeseektime('4612')">1:16:52</a> allah doesn't want people to go to hell  
<a onclick="modifyYTiframeseektime('4615')">1:16:55</a> this is this is a quranic fact he sends  
<a onclick="modifyYTiframeseektime('4618')">1:16:58</a> people to hell  
<a onclick="modifyYTiframeseektime('4619')">1:16:59</a> but does he want people to go to heaven  
<a onclick="modifyYTiframeseektime('4621')">1:17:01</a> no allah subhanahu wa ta'ala  
<a onclick="modifyYTiframeseektime('4625')">1:17:05</a> is also the just allah subhanahu wa  
<a onclick="modifyYTiframeseektime('4627')">1:17:07</a> ta'ala is also forgiving and the  
<a onclick="modifyYTiframeseektime('4629')">1:17:09</a> merciful  
<a onclick="modifyYTiframeseektime('4630')">1:17:10</a> and allah subhanahu wa ta'ala has given  
<a onclick="modifyYTiframeseektime('4632')">1:17:12</a> you the opportunity has kept the door  
<a onclick="modifyYTiframeseektime('4634')">1:17:14</a> open to his guidance and mercy  
<a onclick="modifyYTiframeseektime('4636')">1:17:16</a> we shut that door and then the only door  
<a onclick="modifyYTiframeseektime('4638')">1:17:18</a> that is left  
<a onclick="modifyYTiframeseektime('4639')">1:17:19</a> is we throw ourselves into the hellfire  
<a onclick="modifyYTiframeseektime('4642')">1:17:22</a> so it's not the question of  
<a onclick="modifyYTiframeseektime('4643')">1:17:23</a> how can a loving lord send us to hell  
<a onclick="modifyYTiframeseektime('4646')">1:17:26</a> but rather  
<a onclick="modifyYTiframeseektime('4647')">1:17:27</a> how can how can we choose hell  
<a onclick="modifyYTiframeseektime('4650')">1:17:30</a> over a loving lord as allah says in the  
<a onclick="modifyYTiframeseektime('4652')">1:17:32</a> quran  
<a onclick="modifyYTiframeseektime('4653')">1:17:33</a> and they did and we did not wrong them  
<a onclick="modifyYTiframeseektime('4656')">1:17:36</a> they  
<a onclick="modifyYTiframeseektime('4656')">1:17:36</a> wronged themselves we throw ourselves  
<a onclick="modifyYTiframeseektime('4660')">1:17:40</a> from an existential spiritual  
<a onclick="modifyYTiframeseektime('4661')">1:17:41</a> perspective into the hellfire  
<a onclick="modifyYTiframeseektime('4663')">1:17:43</a> that's something that's very important  
<a onclick="modifyYTiframeseektime('4664')">1:17:44</a> to understand and when you're in hell  
<a onclick="modifyYTiframeseektime('4668')">1:17:48</a> people will not say it's an injustice  
<a onclick="modifyYTiframeseektime('4672')">1:17:52</a> think about that think about that people  
<a onclick="modifyYTiframeseektime('4675')">1:17:55</a> will not say it's an injustice it's a  
<a onclick="modifyYTiframeseektime('4678')">1:17:58</a> manifestation of the justice of allah  
<a onclick="modifyYTiframeseektime('4681')">1:18:01</a> the forgiveness and guidance the door  
<a onclick="modifyYTiframeseektime('4683')">1:18:03</a> was open  
<a onclick="modifyYTiframeseektime('4684')">1:18:04</a> we closed it and this is very  
<a onclick="modifyYTiframeseektime('4687')">1:18:07</a> interesting considering the maximum  
<a onclick="modifyYTiframeseektime('4688')">1:18:08</a> forgiveness of allah anyway because  
<a onclick="modifyYTiframeseektime('4691')">1:18:11</a> allah subhanahu wa ta'ala  
<a onclick="modifyYTiframeseektime('4693')">1:18:13</a> and by the way when allah says you know  
<a onclick="modifyYTiframeseektime('4695')">1:18:15</a> when we say whoever allah guides no one  
<a onclick="modifyYTiframeseektime('4697')">1:18:17</a> can misguide whoever allah misguides no  
<a onclick="modifyYTiframeseektime('4698')">1:18:18</a> one can guide  
<a onclick="modifyYTiframeseektime('4700')">1:18:20</a> that also has a context because when you  
<a onclick="modifyYTiframeseektime('4701')">1:18:21</a> look into the quran allah says allah  
<a onclick="modifyYTiframeseektime('4703')">1:18:23</a> does not guide so and so  
<a onclick="modifyYTiframeseektime('4705')">1:18:25</a> allah loves so-and-so so there's a kind  
<a onclick="modifyYTiframeseektime('4707')">1:18:27</a> of almost  
<a onclick="modifyYTiframeseektime('4709')">1:18:29</a> quasi-spiritual correlation between who  
<a onclick="modifyYTiframeseektime('4711')">1:18:31</a> we are in guidance and misguidance for  
<a onclick="modifyYTiframeseektime('4713')">1:18:33</a> example if you're arrogant  
<a onclick="modifyYTiframeseektime('4714')">1:18:34</a> then that's going to be a barrier to  
<a onclick="modifyYTiframeseektime('4716')">1:18:36</a> divine guidance and mercy but  
<a onclick="modifyYTiframeseektime('4718')">1:18:38</a> the backdrop is that allah guides and  
<a onclick="modifyYTiframeseektime('4720')">1:18:40</a> misguides whoever he wills  
<a onclick="modifyYTiframeseektime('4721')">1:18:41</a> but there is a kind of elaboration to a  
<a onclick="modifyYTiframeseektime('4724')">1:18:44</a> certain degree on  
<a onclick="modifyYTiframeseektime('4725')">1:18:45</a> the kind of spiritual mechanics of that  
<a onclick="modifyYTiframeseektime('4727')">1:18:47</a> yeah but notwithstanding it's very  
<a onclick="modifyYTiframeseektime('4729')">1:18:49</a> important to even look at the story of  
<a onclick="modifyYTiframeseektime('4730')">1:18:50</a> adam alaihissalam

<a onclick="modifyYTiframeseektime('4764')">1:19:24</a> forgiveness is not based on the

<a onclick="modifyYTiframeseektime('4825')">1:20:25</a> give you two scenarios it's not an

<a onclick="modifyYTiframeseektime('4828')">1:20:28</a> greater reason  
<a onclick="modifyYTiframeseektime('4829')">1:20:29</a> example no scenario number one you have  
<a onclick="modifyYTiframeseektime('4831')">1:20:31</a> a king of a castle  
<a onclick="modifyYTiframeseektime('4833')">1:20:33</a> as servant of the castle he does  
<a onclick="modifyYTiframeseektime('4836')">1:20:36</a> something wrong and he goes to the king

<a onclick="modifyYTiframeseektime('4839')">1:20:39</a> king says i can't forgive you the only

<a onclick="modifyYTiframeseektime('4842')">1:20:42</a> is for me to kill my son but not only to

<a onclick="modifyYTiframeseektime('4848')">1:20:48</a> killed my son  
<a onclick="modifyYTiframeseektime('4850')">1:20:50</a> is that maximal forgiveness maximal love  
<a onclick="modifyYTiframeseektime('4852')">1:20:52</a> no  
<a onclick="modifyYTiframeseektime('4853')">1:20:53</a> look at another scenario king of a

<a onclick="modifyYTiframeseektime('4856')">1:20:56</a> someone a servant makes a mistake does

<a onclick="modifyYTiframeseektime('4868')">1:21:08</a> what is maximum forgiveness scenario  
<a onclick="modifyYTiframeseektime('4870')">1:21:10</a> number one or sarah number two what's  
<a onclick="modifyYTiframeseektime('4871')">1:21:11</a> more in line with maximum forgiveness  
<a onclick="modifyYTiframeseektime('4873')">1:21:13</a> it's scenario number two scenario number  
<a onclick="modifyYTiframeseektime('4876')">1:21:16</a> one  
<a onclick="modifyYTiframeseektime('4877')">1:21:17</a> describes the biblical god scenario

<a onclick="modifyYTiframeseektime('4888')">1:21:28</a> allah turned to our father and told him  
<a onclick="modifyYTiframeseektime('4891')">1:21:31</a> words of forgiveness  
<a onclick="modifyYTiframeseektime('4892')">1:21:32</a> which by extrapolation means allah  
<a onclick="modifyYTiframeseektime('4894')">1:21:34</a> turned to us  
<a onclick="modifyYTiframeseektime('4895')">1:21:35</a> and taught us words of forgiveness all  
<a onclick="modifyYTiframeseektime('4897')">1:21:37</a> we have to do is ask allah for  
<a onclick="modifyYTiframeseektime('4898')">1:21:38</a> forgiveness  
<a onclick="modifyYTiframeseektime('4901')">1:21:41</a> i hope that answers the questions yeah i  
<a onclick="modifyYTiframeseektime('4903')">1:21:43</a> just want to  
<a onclick="modifyYTiframeseektime('4904')">1:21:44</a> um make reference to a verse of the  
<a onclick="modifyYTiframeseektime('4906')">1:21:46</a> quran  
<a onclick="modifyYTiframeseektime('4907')">1:21:47</a> and to a hadith as well that really get  
<a onclick="modifyYTiframeseektime('4910')">1:21:50</a> this point across  
<a onclick="modifyYTiframeseektime('4911')">1:21:51</a> so the the verse of  
<a onclick="modifyYTiframeseektime('4915')">1:21:55</a> uh chapter 39 verse  
<a onclick="modifyYTiframeseektime('4919')">1:21:59</a> 53 uh where allah says  
<a onclick="modifyYTiframeseektime('4923')">1:22:03</a> uh say all my servants who have  
<a onclick="modifyYTiframeseektime('4924')">1:22:04</a> transgressed against themselves  
<a onclick="modifyYTiframeseektime('4927')">1:22:07</a> um so noting here as well that allah  
<a onclick="modifyYTiframeseektime('4929')">1:22:09</a> hasn't wronged us we we've wrung  
<a onclick="modifyYTiframeseektime('4931')">1:22:11</a> ourselves  
<a onclick="modifyYTiframeseektime('4931')">1:22:11</a> do not despair of the mercy of allah  
<a onclick="modifyYTiframeseektime('4933')">1:22:13</a> subhanahu wa'ta'ala indeed allah  
<a onclick="modifyYTiframeseektime('4935')">1:22:15</a> forgives  
<a onclick="modifyYTiframeseektime('4936')">1:22:16</a> all sins indeed he uh it is he  
<a onclick="modifyYTiframeseektime('4940')">1:22:20</a> who is the forgiving the merciful and  
<a onclick="modifyYTiframeseektime('4941')">1:22:21</a> it's conditional here that the person  
<a onclick="modifyYTiframeseektime('4943')">1:22:23</a> turns to him  
<a onclick="modifyYTiframeseektime('4944')">1:22:24</a> and seeks repentance and so allah says  
<a onclick="modifyYTiframeseektime('4947')">1:22:27</a> in the quran  
<a onclick="modifyYTiframeseektime('4948')">1:22:28</a> he doesn't forgive shirk that's on the  
<a onclick="modifyYTiframeseektime('4951')">1:22:31</a> condition that the person hasn't turned  
<a onclick="modifyYTiframeseektime('4952')">1:22:32</a> and seeks repentance that is they've  
<a onclick="modifyYTiframeseektime('4954')">1:22:34</a> sincerely  
<a onclick="modifyYTiframeseektime('4955')">1:22:35</a> gone to him and asked and so there's  
<a onclick="modifyYTiframeseektime('4957')">1:22:37</a> another hadith that really complements  
<a onclick="modifyYTiframeseektime('4959')">1:22:39</a> this  
<a onclick="modifyYTiframeseektime('4959')">1:22:39</a> um that's a beautiful hadith and it's  
<a onclick="modifyYTiframeseektime('4963')">1:22:43</a> one of the forty hadith uh kudzi  
<a onclick="modifyYTiframeseektime('4966')">1:22:46</a> and it says on the authority of anas may  
<a onclick="modifyYTiframeseektime('4968')">1:22:48</a> allah pleases him he said  
<a onclick="modifyYTiframeseektime('4969')">1:22:49</a> i heard the messenger of allah um  
<a onclick="modifyYTiframeseektime('4973')">1:22:53</a> say allah the almighty said o son of  
<a onclick="modifyYTiframeseektime('4976')">1:22:56</a> adam so long as you call upon me and ask  
<a onclick="modifyYTiframeseektime('4978')">1:22:58</a> of me  
<a onclick="modifyYTiframeseektime('4979')">1:22:59</a> i shall forgive you for what you have  
<a onclick="modifyYTiframeseektime('4981')">1:23:01</a> done and i shall not mind  
<a onclick="modifyYTiframeseektime('4983')">1:23:03</a> oh son of adam alaihi salaam were your  
<a onclick="modifyYTiframeseektime('4985')">1:23:05</a> sins to reach the clouds of the sky  
<a onclick="modifyYTiframeseektime('4989')">1:23:09</a> and were you then to ask forgiveness of  
<a onclick="modifyYTiframeseektime('4991')">1:23:11</a> me i would forgive you  
<a onclick="modifyYTiframeseektime('4993')">1:23:13</a> oh son of adam were you to come to me  
<a onclick="modifyYTiframeseektime('4995')">1:23:15</a> with sins  
<a onclick="modifyYTiframeseektime('4996')">1:23:16</a> nearly as great as the earth and you  
<a onclick="modifyYTiframeseektime('4998')">1:23:18</a> were to face  
<a onclick="modifyYTiframeseektime('4999')">1:23:19</a> me ascribing no partner to me i would  
<a onclick="modifyYTiframeseektime('5002')">1:23:22</a> bring forgiveness nearly as great as it  
<a onclick="modifyYTiframeseektime('5005')">1:23:25</a> it was related at uh at tiramidi uh also  
<a onclick="modifyYTiframeseektime('5009')">1:23:29</a> by ahmad  
<a onclick="modifyYTiframeseektime('5011')">1:23:31</a> and it's considered a sound hadith so  
<a onclick="modifyYTiframeseektime('5014')">1:23:34</a> allah here is it  
<a onclick="modifyYTiframeseektime('5016')">1:23:36</a> is making it so clear that that no  
<a onclick="modifyYTiframeseektime('5019')">1:23:39</a> matter how  
<a onclick="modifyYTiframeseektime('5020')">1:23:40</a> bad of a person you've been no matter to  
<a onclick="modifyYTiframeseektime('5022')">1:23:42</a> what degree  
<a onclick="modifyYTiframeseektime('5023')">1:23:43</a> your sins pile up into the earth  
<a onclick="modifyYTiframeseektime('5026')">1:23:46</a> he can wipe them all away and all it  
<a onclick="modifyYTiframeseektime('5029')">1:23:49</a> takes is you to turn to him so  
<a onclick="modifyYTiframeseektime('5031')">1:23:51</a> and for those who go oh well i could  
<a onclick="modifyYTiframeseektime('5033')">1:23:53</a> forgive um  
<a onclick="modifyYTiframeseektime('5034')">1:23:54</a> more how can you forgive more than all  
<a onclick="modifyYTiframeseektime('5037')">1:23:57</a> you know  
<a onclick="modifyYTiframeseektime('5038')">1:23:58</a> you can't do more than that and for  
<a onclick="modifyYTiframeseektime('5039')">1:23:59</a> those who say i would forgive someone  
<a onclick="modifyYTiframeseektime('5040')">1:24:00</a> even if they didn't see forgiveness  
<a onclick="modifyYTiframeseektime('5042')">1:24:02</a> so how is that is not wise that like so  
<a onclick="modifyYTiframeseektime('5045')">1:24:05</a> what you need to understand is  
<a onclick="modifyYTiframeseektime('5046')">1:24:06</a> allah is not all merciful he's the most  
<a onclick="modifyYTiframeseektime('5049')">1:24:09</a> merciful  
<a onclick="modifyYTiframeseektime('5050')">1:24:10</a> and what this suggests is that being all  
<a onclick="modifyYTiframeseektime('5053')">1:24:13</a> merciful  
<a onclick="modifyYTiframeseektime('5053')">1:24:13</a> isn't praiseworthy so we've got a  
<a onclick="modifyYTiframeseektime('5056')">1:24:16</a> perfect example to  
<a onclick="modifyYTiframeseektime('5057')">1:24:17</a> demonstrate that being all merciful is  
<a onclick="modifyYTiframeseektime('5059')">1:24:19</a> not praiseworthy  
<a onclick="modifyYTiframeseektime('5060')">1:24:20</a> um so the example of the christ church  
<a onclick="modifyYTiframeseektime('5063')">1:24:23</a> killer  
<a onclick="modifyYTiframeseektime('5064')">1:24:24</a> now subhanallah i was unfortunate enough  
<a onclick="modifyYTiframeseektime('5068')">1:24:28</a> to have  
<a onclick="modifyYTiframeseektime('5068')">1:24:28</a> seen the video of this sick individual  
<a onclick="modifyYTiframeseektime('5072')">1:24:32</a> and it was heartbreaking and he showed  
<a onclick="modifyYTiframeseektime('5074')">1:24:34</a> no remorse  
<a onclick="modifyYTiframeseektime('5075')">1:24:35</a> he acted like it was a computer game he  
<a onclick="modifyYTiframeseektime('5078')">1:24:38</a> was proud of what he did  
<a onclick="modifyYTiframeseektime('5079')">1:24:39</a> he would you know and if he's in court  
<a onclick="modifyYTiframeseektime('5082')">1:24:42</a> and he's before the judge  
<a onclick="modifyYTiframeseektime('5084')">1:24:44</a> and he's made it clear that he's done it  
<a onclick="modifyYTiframeseektime('5086')">1:24:46</a> everyone knows he's done it this video  
<a onclick="modifyYTiframeseektime('5087')">1:24:47</a> footage that you know he's not denying  
<a onclick="modifyYTiframeseektime('5089')">1:24:49</a> it  
<a onclick="modifyYTiframeseektime('5089')">1:24:49</a> um and he's showing he's proud he's not  
<a onclick="modifyYTiframeseektime('5091')">1:24:51</a> remorseful  
<a onclick="modifyYTiframeseektime('5092')">1:24:52</a> he's not seeking forgiveness he'd say  
<a onclick="modifyYTiframeseektime('5095')">1:24:55</a> he'd do it again  
<a onclick="modifyYTiframeseektime('5096')">1:24:56</a> he's justifying it and you know he's  
<a onclick="modifyYTiframeseektime('5100')">1:25:00</a> he's in a position where he's done what  
<a onclick="modifyYTiframeseektime('5102')">1:25:02</a> he's done  
<a onclick="modifyYTiframeseektime('5103')">1:25:03</a> and he has no consideration whatsoever  
<a onclick="modifyYTiframeseektime('5106')">1:25:06</a> um for seeking forgiveness at all  
<a onclick="modifyYTiframeseektime('5110')">1:25:10</a> now if the judge in this case was to say  
<a onclick="modifyYTiframeseektime('5113')">1:25:13</a> you know what i'm going to have mercy on  
<a onclick="modifyYTiframeseektime('5115')">1:25:15</a> him i forgive you  
<a onclick="modifyYTiframeseektime('5117')">1:25:17</a> yeah you could call him like really what  
<a onclick="modifyYTiframeseektime('5120')">1:25:20</a> merciful in this degree um to  
<a onclick="modifyYTiframeseektime('5123')">1:25:23</a> i guess in some way you could maybe even  
<a onclick="modifyYTiframeseektime('5125')">1:25:25</a> say that he was really forgiving  
<a onclick="modifyYTiframeseektime('5127')">1:25:27</a> um but is that just and is it wise  
<a onclick="modifyYTiframeseektime('5131')">1:25:31</a> of course not this example  
<a onclick="modifyYTiframeseektime('5134')">1:25:34</a> of mercy is is an example of a  
<a onclick="modifyYTiframeseektime('5137')">1:25:37</a> an idiotic mercy of a non-praiseworthy  
<a onclick="modifyYTiframeseektime('5141')">1:25:41</a> form of mercy  
<a onclick="modifyYTiframeseektime('5143')">1:25:43</a> mercy yeah it's a non-maximal mercy  
<a onclick="modifyYTiframeseektime('5146')">1:25:46</a> absolutely  
<a onclick="modifyYTiframeseektime('5146')">1:25:46</a> yeah just give them this scenario  
<a onclick="modifyYTiframeseektime('5150')">1:25:50</a> should hitler and moses have the same  
<a onclick="modifyYTiframeseektime('5153')">1:25:53</a> fate  
<a onclick="modifyYTiframeseektime('5156')">1:25:56</a> just intuitively should hitler and moses  
<a onclick="modifyYTiframeseektime('5159')">1:25:59</a> have the same fate  
<a onclick="modifyYTiframeseektime('5160')">1:26:00</a> if you believe they should have all the

<a onclick="modifyYTiframeseektime('5164')">1:26:04</a> then in reality you don't value anything  
<a onclick="modifyYTiframeseektime('5167')">1:26:07</a> because if everything is valued the same  
<a onclick="modifyYTiframeseektime('5169')">1:26:09</a> then you don't value anything at all  
<a onclick="modifyYTiframeseektime('5170')">1:26:10</a> which is not praiseworthy it's not  
<a onclick="modifyYTiframeseektime('5171')">1:26:11</a> maximally perfect  
<a onclick="modifyYTiframeseektime('5172')">1:26:12</a> that's not a maximal way of dealing with

<a onclick="modifyYTiframeseektime('5176')">1:26:16</a> are you saying hitler and moses should  
<a onclick="modifyYTiframeseektime('5178')">1:26:18</a> have the same outcome  
<a onclick="modifyYTiframeseektime('5180')">1:26:20</a> as a principal of course you wouldn't it  
<a onclick="modifyYTiframeseektime('5183')">1:26:23</a> would be insane thing to say  
<a onclick="modifyYTiframeseektime('5185')">1:26:25</a> it's just like when people say oh i love  
<a onclick="modifyYTiframeseektime('5187')">1:26:27</a> everything if you love everything with  
<a onclick="modifyYTiframeseektime('5188')">1:26:28</a> all due respect you don't have anything  
<a onclick="modifyYTiframeseektime('5190')">1:26:30</a> if you love everything you don't love  
<a onclick="modifyYTiframeseektime('5192')">1:26:32</a> anything at all because are you gonna  
<a onclick="modifyYTiframeseektime('5194')">1:26:34</a> love  
<a onclick="modifyYTiframeseektime('5194')">1:26:34</a> the barriers to love are you gonna love  
<a onclick="modifyYTiframeseektime('5197')">1:26:37</a> hate are you gonna love  
<a onclick="modifyYTiframeseektime('5198')">1:26:38</a> those things which prevent love from  
<a onclick="modifyYTiframeseektime('5200')">1:26:40</a> manifesting itself  
<a onclick="modifyYTiframeseektime('5202')">1:26:42</a> it's such an insane thing to say right  
<a onclick="modifyYTiframeseektime('5206')">1:26:46</a> i love everything well if you love  
<a onclick="modifyYTiframeseektime('5208')">1:26:48</a> everything you don't love  
<a onclick="modifyYTiframeseektime('5209')">1:26:49</a> anything at all right and similarly and  
<a onclick="modifyYTiframeseektime('5212')">1:26:52</a> that's why  
<a onclick="modifyYTiframeseektime('5213')">1:26:53</a> value comes into play justice comes into  
<a onclick="modifyYTiframeseektime('5215')">1:26:55</a> play like uh yusuf eloquently just  
<a onclick="modifyYTiframeseektime('5217')">1:26:57</a> uh expressed his lock right here yusuf  
<a onclick="modifyYTiframeseektime('5219')">1:26:59</a> beautiful

<a onclick="modifyYTiframeseektime('5230')">1:27:10</a> bro looks a bit like you bro  
<a onclick="modifyYTiframeseektime('5232')">1:27:12</a> that's a long ago  
<a onclick="modifyYTiframeseektime('5249')">1:27:29</a> i'm on my phone with headphone yeah now  
<a onclick="modifyYTiframeseektime('5251')">1:27:31</a> it's clear  
<a onclick="modifyYTiframeseektime('5252')">1:27:32</a> yeah it sounds a bit better now there's  
<a onclick="modifyYTiframeseektime('5253')">1:27:33</a> no way no no there's echo i can hear it  
<a onclick="modifyYTiframeseektime('5256')">1:27:36</a> though  
<a onclick="modifyYTiframeseektime('5257')">1:27:37</a> yeah can you what we'll do is uh  
<a onclick="modifyYTiframeseektime('5260')">1:27:40</a> when we're talking we'll mute you and  
<a onclick="modifyYTiframeseektime('5262')">1:27:42</a> then when we finish talking we'll unmute  
<a onclick="modifyYTiframeseektime('5263')">1:27:43</a> so that you can see what you need to say  
<a onclick="modifyYTiframeseektime('5265')">1:27:45</a> inshallah  
<a onclick="modifyYTiframeseektime('5268')">1:27:48</a> so it's been a several times i i've  
<a onclick="modifyYTiframeseektime('5270')">1:27:50</a> joined sapiens lab  
<a onclick="modifyYTiframeseektime('5271')">1:27:51</a> but uh it's first time i'm talking to  
<a onclick="modifyYTiframeseektime('5273')">1:27:53</a> ustad hamza  
<a onclick="modifyYTiframeseektime('5274')">1:27:54</a> so it's a very special moment for me  
<a onclick="modifyYTiframeseektime('5278')">1:27:58</a> so basically um i have no actually  
<a onclick="modifyYTiframeseektime('5282')">1:28:02</a> question but uh and recently i'm  
<a onclick="modifyYTiframeseektime('5284')">1:28:04</a> discussing with an agnostic  
<a onclick="modifyYTiframeseektime('5286')">1:28:06</a> uh agnostica i don't personally i don't  
<a onclick="modifyYTiframeseektime('5290')">1:28:10</a> personally know him uh he's actually  
<a onclick="modifyYTiframeseektime('5292')">1:28:12</a> from somalia and then he  
<a onclick="modifyYTiframeseektime('5295')">1:28:15</a> have gone to england so then  
<a onclick="modifyYTiframeseektime('5298')">1:28:18</a> uh so i have been discussing him for uh  
<a onclick="modifyYTiframeseektime('5301')">1:28:21</a> several months  
<a onclick="modifyYTiframeseektime('5303')">1:28:23</a> so first of all when a talk started with  
<a onclick="modifyYTiframeseektime('5306')">1:28:26</a> the existence of god  
<a onclick="modifyYTiframeseektime('5308')">1:28:28</a> then i have just at first i just  
<a onclick="modifyYTiframeseektime('5311')">1:28:31</a> shared the cosmological argument with  
<a onclick="modifyYTiframeseektime('5314')">1:28:34</a> him  
<a onclick="modifyYTiframeseektime('5315')">1:28:35</a> then after after  
<a onclick="modifyYTiframeseektime('5318')">1:28:38</a> discussing it he said to me that it does  
<a onclick="modifyYTiframeseektime('5320')">1:28:40</a> make sense to him but  
<a onclick="modifyYTiframeseektime('5322')">1:28:42</a> then um he just he just said no  
<a onclick="modifyYTiframeseektime('5326')">1:28:46</a> but at the end of the day it doesn't  
<a onclick="modifyYTiframeseektime('5328')">1:28:48</a> make sense so  
<a onclick="modifyYTiframeseektime('5330')">1:28:50</a> he's not certain about whether  
<a onclick="modifyYTiframeseektime('5333')">1:28:53</a> the argument is coherent or incoherent  
<a onclick="modifyYTiframeseektime('5337')">1:28:57</a> then we just moved on saying  
<a onclick="modifyYTiframeseektime('5341')">1:29:01</a> about hell now which brother asked  
<a onclick="modifyYTiframeseektime('5344')">1:29:04</a> before me about the hell and a merciful  
<a onclick="modifyYTiframeseektime('5347')">1:29:07</a> god  
<a onclick="modifyYTiframeseektime('5348')">1:29:08</a> so the fact is when i give him  
<a onclick="modifyYTiframeseektime('5351')">1:29:11</a> when i uh give him give him an argument  
<a onclick="modifyYTiframeseektime('5354')">1:29:14</a> he he don't actually  
<a onclick="modifyYTiframeseektime('5356')">1:29:16</a> uh counter my argument or try to  
<a onclick="modifyYTiframeseektime('5359')">1:29:19</a> count counter attack me or or any  
<a onclick="modifyYTiframeseektime('5362')">1:29:22</a> argument he just  
<a onclick="modifyYTiframeseektime('5364')">1:29:24</a> keep repeating the same thing that how  
<a onclick="modifyYTiframeseektime('5365')">1:29:25</a> allah can bring me to hell just because  
<a onclick="modifyYTiframeseektime('5368')">1:29:28</a> i  
<a onclick="modifyYTiframeseektime('5368')">1:29:28</a> i don't believe in him and just because  
<a onclick="modifyYTiframeseektime('5371')">1:29:31</a> reminds me of someone reminds me  
<a onclick="modifyYTiframeseektime('5375')">1:29:35</a> yeah well yeah just because i don't  
<a onclick="modifyYTiframeseektime('5376')">1:29:36</a> believe  
<a onclick="modifyYTiframeseektime('5380')">1:29:40</a> it's not as simple as that because you  
<a onclick="modifyYTiframeseektime('5383')">1:29:43</a> see  
<a onclick="modifyYTiframeseektime('5384')">1:29:44</a> it's not hacking allah sending me to  
<a onclick="modifyYTiframeseektime('5386')">1:29:46</a> help someone believe in him no  
<a onclick="modifyYTiframeseektime('5387')">1:29:47</a> it's basically you are choosing hell  
<a onclick="modifyYTiframeseektime('5390')">1:29:50</a> because you're choosing not to believe  
<a onclick="modifyYTiframeseektime('5391')">1:29:51</a> in him  
<a onclick="modifyYTiframeseektime('5392')">1:29:52</a> when the truth comes apart to you and  
<a onclick="modifyYTiframeseektime('5394')">1:29:54</a> you could tell that his issue is not  
<a onclick="modifyYTiframeseektime('5396')">1:29:56</a> an intellectual because he doesn't have  
<a onclick="modifyYTiframeseektime('5398')">1:29:58</a> responses to intellectual arguments he's  
<a onclick="modifyYTiframeseektime('5399')">1:29:59</a> got something else that's going on  
<a onclick="modifyYTiframeseektime('5401')">1:30:01</a> and an emotive or psychological issue or  
<a onclick="modifyYTiframeseektime('5403')">1:30:03</a> even a spiritual issue  
<a onclick="modifyYTiframeseektime('5405')">1:30:05</a> the point here is the question's wrong  
<a onclick="modifyYTiframeseektime('5408')">1:30:08</a> it's like  
<a onclick="modifyYTiframeseektime('5408')">1:30:08</a> i'm rejecting allah i'm closing the door  
<a onclick="modifyYTiframeseektime('5411')">1:30:11</a> to allah's guidance and mercy we've  
<a onclick="modifyYTiframeseektime('5412')">1:30:12</a> mentioned this before if  
<a onclick="modifyYTiframeseektime('5413')">1:30:13</a> you go on this live stream hopefully  
<a onclick="modifyYTiframeseektime('5415')">1:30:15</a> we'll do the time stamps and you see a  
<a onclick="modifyYTiframeseektime('5417')">1:30:17</a> more lengthy answer that we've  
<a onclick="modifyYTiframeseektime('5418')">1:30:18</a> elaborated on this  
<a onclick="modifyYTiframeseektime('5420')">1:30:20</a> but basically you are choosing hell over  
<a onclick="modifyYTiframeseektime('5422')">1:30:22</a> allah that's the point  
<a onclick="modifyYTiframeseektime('5424')">1:30:24</a> allah doesn't want anyone to go to hell  
<a onclick="modifyYTiframeseektime('5426')">1:30:26</a> we already mentioned this before we've  
<a onclick="modifyYTiframeseektime('5427')">1:30:27</a> elaborated on this  
<a onclick="modifyYTiframeseektime('5428')">1:30:28</a> the thing is allah does not wrong them  
<a onclick="modifyYTiframeseektime('5430')">1:30:30</a> they wrong themselves  
<a onclick="modifyYTiframeseektime('5431')">1:30:31</a> okay so this is very critical for them  
<a onclick="modifyYTiframeseektime('5433')">1:30:33</a> to understand is that you are actually  
<a onclick="modifyYTiframeseektime('5435')">1:30:35</a> making the choice  
<a onclick="modifyYTiframeseektime('5436')">1:30:36</a> right you are making closing the stamp  
<a onclick="modifyYTiframeseektime('5438')">1:30:38</a> of your heart i learned this from  
<a onclick="modifyYTiframeseektime('5441')">1:30:41</a> this very beautiful video he did it was  
<a onclick="modifyYTiframeseektime('5443')">1:30:43</a> very simple but it was profound  
<a onclick="modifyYTiframeseektime('5444')">1:30:44</a> he was like you know you keep on  
<a onclick="modifyYTiframeseektime('5446')">1:30:46</a> rejecting allah closing though to his  
<a onclick="modifyYTiframeseektime('5447')">1:30:47</a> mercy  
<a onclick="modifyYTiframeseektime('5448')">1:30:48</a> you still got hope then you keep on  
<a onclick="modifyYTiframeseektime('5450')">1:30:50</a> closing the door to his mercy and you  
<a onclick="modifyYTiframeseektime('5451')">1:30:51</a> keep on  
<a onclick="modifyYTiframeseektime('5452')">1:30:52</a> closing the door to forgiveness you keep  
<a onclick="modifyYTiframeseektime('5453')">1:30:53</a> on closing the door you keep on normal  
<a onclick="modifyYTiframeseektime('5455')">1:30:55</a> to go through that door that's open for  
<a onclick="modifyYTiframeseektime('5457')">1:30:57</a> you  
<a onclick="modifyYTiframeseektime('5458')">1:30:58</a> and you keep on doing it you keep on  
<a onclick="modifyYTiframeseektime('5459')">1:30:59</a> doing it and then you've stamped your  
<a onclick="modifyYTiframeseektime('5460')">1:31:00</a> heart  
<a onclick="modifyYTiframeseektime('5461')">1:31:01</a> and then it's closed right so it's  
<a onclick="modifyYTiframeseektime('5463')">1:31:03</a> similar to that it's you're doing  
<a onclick="modifyYTiframeseektime('5465')">1:31:05</a> it is you're doing so what you need to  
<a onclick="modifyYTiframeseektime('5467')">1:31:07</a> do with that human being you get to  
<a onclick="modifyYTiframeseektime('5469')">1:31:09</a> realize that they actually have a  
<a onclick="modifyYTiframeseektime('5470')">1:31:10</a> responsibility the option is  
<a onclick="modifyYTiframeseektime('5472')">1:31:12</a> open for them to go to paradise the  
<a onclick="modifyYTiframeseektime('5475')">1:31:15</a> option for allah's forgiveness and love  
<a onclick="modifyYTiframeseektime('5476')">1:31:16</a> is there is waiting for them  
<a onclick="modifyYTiframeseektime('5478')">1:31:18</a> they just have to walk through that door  
<a onclick="modifyYTiframeseektime('5480')">1:31:20</a> that's what they have to not realize  
<a onclick="modifyYTiframeseektime('5482')">1:31:22</a> that's the paradigm shift you have to  
<a onclick="modifyYTiframeseektime('5483')">1:31:23</a> explain to them  
<a onclick="modifyYTiframeseektime('5485')">1:31:25</a> and and you have to explain to them this  
<a onclick="modifyYTiframeseektime('5487')">1:31:27</a> actually you not willing to walk through  
<a onclick="modifyYTiframeseektime('5488')">1:31:28</a> that door so you're sending yourself  
<a onclick="modifyYTiframeseektime('5490')">1:31:30</a> to the other direction you're moving  
<a onclick="modifyYTiframeseektime('5492')">1:31:32</a> away from paradise from eternal bliss  
<a onclick="modifyYTiframeseektime('5494')">1:31:34</a> and you're throwing yourself into  
<a onclick="modifyYTiframeseektime('5495')">1:31:35</a> jahannam that's what they need to  
<a onclick="modifyYTiframeseektime('5497')">1:31:37</a> realize  
<a onclick="modifyYTiframeseektime('5499')">1:31:39</a> um so if you go previously hopefully  
<a onclick="modifyYTiframeseektime('5501')">1:31:41</a> we'll  
<a onclick="modifyYTiframeseektime('5502')">1:31:42</a> time stamp all the other questions um  
<a onclick="modifyYTiframeseektime('5504')">1:31:44</a> because we elaborate on this  
<a onclick="modifyYTiframeseektime('5506')">1:31:46</a> in i think two different places in  
<a onclick="modifyYTiframeseektime('5508')">1:31:48</a> detail so you know i think this person  
<a onclick="modifyYTiframeseektime('5510')">1:31:50</a> needs i think  
<a onclick="modifyYTiframeseektime('5512')">1:31:52</a> needs maybe an awareness of who is needs  
<a onclick="modifyYTiframeseektime('5515')">1:31:55</a> some spirituality needs to understand  
<a onclick="modifyYTiframeseektime('5516')">1:31:56</a> allah's names and attributes who allah  
<a onclick="modifyYTiframeseektime('5518')">1:31:58</a> is  
<a onclick="modifyYTiframeseektime('5519')">1:31:59</a> what allah wants from us because if he  
<a onclick="modifyYTiframeseektime('5521')">1:32:01</a> hasn't got responses to intellectual  
<a onclick="modifyYTiframeseektime('5522')">1:32:02</a> arguments just like what we mentioned in  
<a onclick="modifyYTiframeseektime('5523')">1:32:03</a> the beginning about the metaphysical  
<a onclick="modifyYTiframeseektime('5525')">1:32:05</a> backdrop of the human being  
<a onclick="modifyYTiframeseektime('5526')">1:32:06</a> that we're not just an abstract  
<a onclick="modifyYTiframeseektime('5527')">1:32:07</a> intellect there's an interplay between

<a onclick="modifyYTiframeseektime('5533')">1:32:13</a> maybe one of his clouds is not a  
<a onclick="modifyYTiframeseektime('5534')">1:32:14</a> rational argument he needs some direct

<a onclick="modifyYTiframeseektime('5547')">1:32:27</a> there's something else that's going on  
<a onclick="modifyYTiframeseektime('5548')">1:32:28</a> they need to explore and install with

<a onclick="modifyYTiframeseektime('5556')">1:32:36</a> yeah and also be patient with them like  
<a onclick="modifyYTiframeseektime('5559')">1:32:39</a> if you'd have met  
<a onclick="modifyYTiframeseektime('5560')">1:32:40</a> me in my teenage years maybe  
<a onclick="modifyYTiframeseektime('5563')">1:32:43</a> you would have thought the same um  
<a onclick="modifyYTiframeseektime('5566')">1:32:46</a> i was i could be quite arrogant i could  
<a onclick="modifyYTiframeseektime('5568')">1:32:48</a> be quiet  
<a onclick="modifyYTiframeseektime('5569')">1:32:49</a> um but not saying that i'm not now  
<a onclick="modifyYTiframeseektime('5571')">1:32:51</a> because sometimes i can't be but  
<a onclick="modifyYTiframeseektime('5573')">1:32:53</a> um yeah i was very hard-headed and sure  
<a onclick="modifyYTiframeseektime('5577')">1:32:57</a> of myself in particular ways  
<a onclick="modifyYTiframeseektime('5579')">1:32:59</a> and you know  
<a onclick="modifyYTiframeseektime('5582')">1:33:02</a> aloha about it like however many years  
<a onclick="modifyYTiframeseektime('5584')">1:33:04</a> later um  
<a onclick="modifyYTiframeseektime('5585')">1:33:05</a> i embraced islam and now i actively

<a onclick="modifyYTiframeseektime('5637')">1:33:57</a> sometimes your persistence is something  
<a onclick="modifyYTiframeseektime('5638')">1:33:58</a> that can rub off on them  
<a onclick="modifyYTiframeseektime('5640')">1:34:00</a> and open them up a little bit more or  
<a onclick="modifyYTiframeseektime('5642')">1:34:02</a> help in um  
<a onclick="modifyYTiframeseektime('5643')">1:34:03</a> as hamza was mentioning at the beginning

<a onclick="modifyYTiframeseektime('5648')">1:34:08</a> um because sometimes this is just a case  
<a onclick="modifyYTiframeseektime('5650')">1:34:10</a> of trying to clean away the dust  
<a onclick="modifyYTiframeseektime('5652')">1:34:12</a> before you can sort of you know get to  
<a onclick="modifyYTiframeseektime('5654')">1:34:14</a> the the shiny thing underneath it all  
<a onclick="modifyYTiframeseektime('5656')">1:34:16</a> but um yeah every patient is afraid  
<a onclick="modifyYTiframeseektime('5659')">1:34:19</a> of you so those are beautiful yeah  
<a onclick="modifyYTiframeseektime('5662')">1:34:22</a> patience is actually the  
<a onclick="modifyYTiframeseektime('5663')">1:34:23</a> key for all efforts in islam most of  
<a onclick="modifyYTiframeseektime('5666')">1:34:26</a> them patience is the key to discipline  
<a onclick="modifyYTiframeseektime('5668')">1:34:28</a> as well  
<a onclick="modifyYTiframeseektime('5668')">1:34:28</a> and which is the key to success sabot is  
<a onclick="modifyYTiframeseektime('5674')">1:34:34</a> and there is so much benefit from this i  
<a onclick="modifyYTiframeseektime('5676')">1:34:36</a> think one of the scholars said that the  
<a onclick="modifyYTiframeseektime('5677')">1:34:37</a> basis for all of the  
<a onclick="modifyYTiframeseektime('5679')">1:34:39</a> all of the morals and values in islam is  
<a onclick="modifyYTiframeseektime('5682')">1:34:42</a> actually suffer  
<a onclick="modifyYTiframeseektime('5683')">1:34:43</a> and i would even argue that's the basis  
<a onclick="modifyYTiframeseektime('5685')">1:34:45</a> for success because success is not just  
<a onclick="modifyYTiframeseektime('5687')">1:34:47</a> based on motivation it's based on  
<a onclick="modifyYTiframeseektime('5688')">1:34:48</a> discipline and discipline requires  
<a onclick="modifyYTiframeseektime('5689')">1:34:49</a> suburb  
<a onclick="modifyYTiframeseektime('5690')">1:34:50</a> so use of your your patience narrative  
<a onclick="modifyYTiframeseektime('5693')">1:34:53</a> throughout this  
<a onclick="modifyYTiframeseektime('5695')">1:34:55</a> this this stream you're threading the  
<a onclick="modifyYTiframeseektime('5697')">1:34:57</a> stream with the patient narrative we  
<a onclick="modifyYTiframeseektime('5699')">1:34:59</a> mentioned it more than twice  
<a onclick="modifyYTiframeseektime('5701')">1:35:01</a> it's actually one of the key wisdoms  
<a onclick="modifyYTiframeseektime('5703')">1:35:03</a> from the wisdoms of mr ponders himself  
<a onclick="modifyYTiframeseektime('5705')">1:35:05</a> may allah bless you  
<a onclick="modifyYTiframeseektime('5712')">1:35:12</a> so i have been following you guys hamza  
<a onclick="modifyYTiframeseektime('5714')">1:35:14</a> and your supporters  
<a onclick="modifyYTiframeseektime('5716')">1:35:16</a> and saburam so i have just said to him  
<a onclick="modifyYTiframeseektime('5718')">1:35:18</a> what you just said now  
<a onclick="modifyYTiframeseektime('5720')">1:35:20</a> so i'm just saying that there is nothing  
<a onclick="modifyYTiframeseektime('5722')">1:35:22</a> to do with intellectual  
<a onclick="modifyYTiframeseektime('5724')">1:35:24</a> um about him so i just my objective to  
<a onclick="modifyYTiframeseektime('5727')">1:35:27</a> come to this life is  
<a onclick="modifyYTiframeseektime('5728')">1:35:28</a> just you say something for him then i  
<a onclick="modifyYTiframeseektime('5730')">1:35:30</a> will  
<a onclick="modifyYTiframeseektime('5731')">1:35:31</a> suggest him to see your talks on him  
<a onclick="modifyYTiframeseektime('5735')">1:35:35</a> so i think there's something spiritual  
<a onclick="modifyYTiframeseektime('5737')">1:35:37</a> for him there's nothing intellectual  
<a onclick="modifyYTiframeseektime('5740')">1:35:40</a> yeah advice is forget me or anyone to  
<a onclick="modifyYTiframeseektime('5743')">1:35:43</a> say anything to him  
<a onclick="modifyYTiframeseektime('5744')">1:35:44</a> you've got a relationship with him build  
<a onclick="modifyYTiframeseektime('5746')">1:35:46</a> a nice relationship with him  
<a onclick="modifyYTiframeseektime('5748')">1:35:48</a> and muslims should come across to all

<a onclick="modifyYTiframeseektime('5752')">1:35:52</a> as someone who is committed to the  
<a onclick="modifyYTiframeseektime('5754')">1:35:54</a> goodness and guidance of that person the  
<a onclick="modifyYTiframeseektime('5756')">1:35:56</a> prophet sallallahu alaihi hussain said

<a onclick="modifyYTiframeseektime('5762')">1:36:02</a> this isn't by bukhari  
<a onclick="modifyYTiframeseektime('5765')">1:36:05</a> it's authentic hadith and is similar to  
<a onclick="modifyYTiframeseektime('5768')">1:36:08</a> other  
<a onclick="modifyYTiframeseektime('5768')">1:36:08</a> hadith they even talk about brotherhood  
<a onclick="modifyYTiframeseektime('5770')">1:36:10</a> and so on and so forth and this means  
<a onclick="modifyYTiframeseektime('5772')">1:36:12</a> be committed to the goodness and  
<a onclick="modifyYTiframeseektime('5773')">1:36:13</a> guidance so if you build that trust  
<a onclick="modifyYTiframeseektime('5775')">1:36:15</a> build that relationship don't make it  
<a onclick="modifyYTiframeseektime('5777')">1:36:17</a> just about debates and ego  
<a onclick="modifyYTiframeseektime('5779')">1:36:19</a> try and create awakenings within him

<a onclick="modifyYTiframeseektime('5840')">1:37:20</a> i don't think we're going to be able to  
<a onclick="modifyYTiframeseektime('5841')">1:37:21</a> have like a conversation  
<a onclick="modifyYTiframeseektime('5843')">1:37:23</a> type of audio  
<a onclick="modifyYTiframeseektime('5846')">1:37:26</a> question actually if truth is

<a onclick="modifyYTiframeseektime('5859')">1:37:39</a> if truth is objective how are you going  
<a onclick="modifyYTiframeseektime('5861')">1:37:41</a> to explain i think the best thing to do  
<a onclick="modifyYTiframeseektime('5863')">1:37:43</a> okay is if you type your question  
<a onclick="modifyYTiframeseektime('5865')">1:37:45</a> in the comments it'll be easier because  
<a onclick="modifyYTiframeseektime('5867')">1:37:47</a> i won't

<a onclick="modifyYTiframeseektime('5875')">1:37:55</a> do that we'll get someone else

<a onclick="modifyYTiframeseektime('7193')">1:59:53</a> something that we  
<a onclick="modifyYTiframeseektime('7194')">1:59:54</a> should revive in the tower because

<a onclick="modifyYTiframeseektime('7198')">1:59:58</a> coming from a space in a place that is

<a onclick="modifyYTiframeseektime('7213')">2:00:13</a> intellectualization i'm telling you  
<a onclick="modifyYTiframeseektime('7214')">2:00:14</a> people remember how you made them  
<a onclick="modifyYTiframeseektime('7216')">2:00:16</a> felt and not necessarily what you said  
<a onclick="modifyYTiframeseektime('7219')">2:00:19</a> and  
<a onclick="modifyYTiframeseektime('7219')">2:00:19</a> if all of the duat were like george for  
<a onclick="modifyYTiframeseektime('7222')">2:00:22</a> example  
<a onclick="modifyYTiframeseektime('7223')">2:00:23</a> what kind of character  
<a onclick="modifyYTiframeseektime('7231')">2:00:31</a> loves cooking wants to provide for

<a onclick="modifyYTiframeseektime('7236')">2:00:36</a> advanced our training course uh in the  
<a onclick="modifyYTiframeseektime('7238')">2:00:38</a> characteristics of the  
<a onclick="modifyYTiframeseektime('7239')">2:00:39</a> zora and this is also your behavior your  
<a onclick="modifyYTiframeseektime('7241')">2:00:41</a> character give it could be a means to  
<a onclick="modifyYTiframeseektime('7243')">2:00:43</a> uncloud the fitzvah  
<a onclick="modifyYTiframeseektime('7244')">2:00:44</a> to awaken the truth within because we  
<a onclick="modifyYTiframeseektime('7246')">2:00:46</a> talk about this as an approach  
<a onclick="modifyYTiframeseektime('7247')">2:00:47</a> of unclouded because even if you look at  
<a onclick="modifyYTiframeseektime('7249')">2:00:49</a> statistics  
<a onclick="modifyYTiframeseektime('7250')">2:00:50</a> a lot of people who change their  
<a onclick="modifyYTiframeseektime('7252')">2:00:52</a> religion is not necessary for  
<a onclick="modifyYTiframeseektime('7253')">2:00:53</a> ideological intellectual reasons it's  
<a onclick="modifyYTiframeseektime('7255')">2:00:55</a> because of also  
<a onclick="modifyYTiframeseektime('7256')">2:00:56</a> the kind of social norms or the kind of  
<a onclick="modifyYTiframeseektime('7258')">2:00:58</a> behavior of the people and the character  
<a onclick="modifyYTiframeseektime('7260')">2:01:00</a> and so on and so forth  
<a onclick="modifyYTiframeseektime('7262')">2:01:02</a> so it's very important you know be like

<a onclick="modifyYTiframeseektime('7315')">2:01:55</a> mark now  
<a onclick="modifyYTiframeseektime('7326')">2:02:06</a> [Laughter]  
<a onclick="modifyYTiframeseektime('7330')">2:02:10</a> um so it's a pleasure to meet you guys  
<a onclick="modifyYTiframeseektime('7332')">2:02:12</a> um  
<a onclick="modifyYTiframeseektime('7334')">2:02:14</a> my question is about shikh so sheikh  
<a onclick="modifyYTiframeseektime('7336')">2:02:16</a> means associating partners with allah  
<a onclick="modifyYTiframeseektime('7338')">2:02:18</a> and allah is regarding that as the  
<a onclick="modifyYTiframeseektime('7340')">2:02:20</a> biggest sin  
<a onclick="modifyYTiframeseektime('7342')">2:02:22</a> in humanity right that humans can do  
<a onclick="modifyYTiframeseektime('7345')">2:02:25</a> but i see that the main thing that we're  
<a onclick="modifyYTiframeseektime('7347')">2:02:27</a> seeing is not really [ __ ] but it's more  
<a onclick="modifyYTiframeseektime('7349')">2:02:29</a> like atheism which is not believing in  
<a onclick="modifyYTiframeseektime('7350')">2:02:30</a> allah in the first place  
<a onclick="modifyYTiframeseektime('7352')">2:02:32</a> but the mention of that in the quran is  
<a onclick="modifyYTiframeseektime('7356')">2:02:36</a> if it exists is not nearly as frequent  
<a onclick="modifyYTiframeseektime('7360')">2:02:40</a> as shirk  
<a onclick="modifyYTiframeseektime('7361')">2:02:41</a> so the majority of the world not a  
<a onclick="modifyYTiframeseektime('7363')">2:02:43</a> majority a lot of the people in the  
<a onclick="modifyYTiframeseektime('7364')">2:02:44</a> world do not believe that allah exists  
<a onclick="modifyYTiframeseektime('7366')">2:02:46</a> in the first place  
<a onclick="modifyYTiframeseektime('7367')">2:02:47</a> they are not worshiping him and other  
<a onclick="modifyYTiframeseektime('7370')">2:02:50</a> partners with him so that's  
<a onclick="modifyYTiframeseektime('7371')">2:02:51</a> my question thank you omar how old are  
<a onclick="modifyYTiframeseektime('7374')">2:02:54</a> you bro

<a onclick="modifyYTiframeseektime('7389')">2:03:09</a> question obviously shows that you have  
<a onclick="modifyYTiframeseektime('7391')">2:03:11</a> intelligence and insight um no problem  
<a onclick="modifyYTiframeseektime('7394')">2:03:14</a> and may allah bless your parents for  
<a onclick="modifyYTiframeseektime('7396')">2:03:16</a> facilitating that  
<a onclick="modifyYTiframeseektime('7397')">2:03:17</a> i mean i mean they live in saudi arabia  
<a onclick="modifyYTiframeseektime('7401')">2:03:21</a> so  
<a onclick="modifyYTiframeseektime('7401')">2:03:21</a> and and yeah i told them about you guys  
<a onclick="modifyYTiframeseektime('7404')">2:03:24</a> and about you  
<a onclick="modifyYTiframeseektime('7405')">2:03:25</a> and all these people like they've been a  
<a onclick="modifyYTiframeseektime('7406')">2:03:26</a> great influence in my  
<a onclick="modifyYTiframeseektime('7408')">2:03:28</a> martial arts islam and i helped  
<a onclick="modifyYTiframeseektime('7410')">2:03:30</a> influence another jehovah's witness  
<a onclick="modifyYTiframeseektime('7411')">2:03:31</a> she became a muslim and now  
<a onclick="modifyYTiframeseektime('7415')">2:03:35</a> well ever beautiful so this is the way  
<a onclick="modifyYTiframeseektime('7417')">2:03:37</a> i'll answer the question bro  
<a onclick="modifyYTiframeseektime('7419')">2:03:39</a> atheism is let me explain why  
<a onclick="modifyYTiframeseektime('7423')">2:03:43</a> so when you talk about shiriko  
<a onclick="modifyYTiframeseektime('7425')">2:03:45</a> associating partners with god  
<a onclick="modifyYTiframeseektime('7427')">2:03:47</a> you could call it associationism right  
<a onclick="modifyYTiframeseektime('7429')">2:03:49</a> so  
<a onclick="modifyYTiframeseektime('7430')">2:03:50</a> let's really break down what do we mean  
<a onclick="modifyYTiframeseektime('7432')">2:03:52</a> by allah so first and foremost we affirm  
<a onclick="modifyYTiframeseektime('7435')">2:03:55</a> the fact that allah is one with regards  
<a onclick="modifyYTiframeseektime('7437')">2:03:57</a> to his creative power  
<a onclick="modifyYTiframeseektime('7439')">2:03:59</a> he is the only unique soul transcendent  
<a onclick="modifyYTiframeseektime('7441')">2:04:01</a> master creator owner master of  
<a onclick="modifyYTiframeseektime('7443')">2:04:03</a> everything that exists  
<a onclick="modifyYTiframeseektime('7444')">2:04:04</a> and anyone who basically gives these  
<a onclick="modifyYTiframeseektime('7447')">2:04:07</a> descriptions to other than allah this is  
<a onclick="modifyYTiframeseektime('7449')">2:04:09</a> a form of associationism  
<a onclick="modifyYTiframeseektime('7450')">2:04:10</a> then you have allah's the oneness of  
<a onclick="modifyYTiframeseektime('7452')">2:04:12</a> allah's names and attributes we believe  
<a onclick="modifyYTiframeseektime('7453')">2:04:13</a> allah's names and attributes are  
<a onclick="modifyYTiframeseektime('7455')">2:04:15</a> transcendent we affirm them they're to  
<a onclick="modifyYTiframeseektime('7456')">2:04:16</a> the highest degree possible and they  
<a onclick="modifyYTiframeseektime('7457')">2:04:17</a> have no deficiency no flaw  
<a onclick="modifyYTiframeseektime('7460')">2:04:20</a> and we base if we compare allah's names  
<a onclick="modifyYTiframeseektime('7461')">2:04:21</a> and attributes to a created thing then  
<a onclick="modifyYTiframeseektime('7463')">2:04:23</a> what we've done is a form of  
<a onclick="modifyYTiframeseektime('7465')">2:04:25</a> humanization if we compare a human  
<a onclick="modifyYTiframeseektime('7467')">2:04:27</a> attribute to to allah  
<a onclick="modifyYTiframeseektime('7469')">2:04:29</a> make it the same what we've done is  
<a onclick="modifyYTiframeseektime('7471')">2:04:31</a> deification and those things are  
<a onclick="modifyYTiframeseektime('7473')">2:04:33</a> associationism is shook also we affirm  
<a onclick="modifyYTiframeseektime('7475')">2:04:35</a> the oneness of allah's divinity  
<a onclick="modifyYTiframeseektime('7477')">2:04:37</a> meaning that allah is the only being  
<a onclick="modifyYTiframeseektime('7479')">2:04:39</a> worthy of worship most direct and  
<a onclick="modifyYTiframeseektime('7480')">2:04:40</a> singular all acts of worship to him  
<a onclick="modifyYTiframeseektime('7482')">2:04:42</a> alone  
<a onclick="modifyYTiframeseektime('7482')">2:04:42</a> if we worship other than allah this is  
<a onclick="modifyYTiframeseektime('7484')">2:04:44</a> also associationism  
<a onclick="modifyYTiframeseektime('7486')">2:04:46</a> so how does atheism fit in athens fits  
<a onclick="modifyYTiframeseektime('7488')">2:04:48</a> in in the first thing that we spoke  
<a onclick="modifyYTiframeseektime('7490')">2:04:50</a> about the oneness of allah's creative  
<a onclick="modifyYTiframeseektime('7491')">2:04:51</a> power  
<a onclick="modifyYTiframeseektime('7492')">2:04:52</a> if you reject allah's creative power and  
<a onclick="modifyYTiframeseektime('7495')">2:04:55</a> even if you reject his names and  
<a onclick="modifyYTiframeseektime('7496')">2:04:56</a> attributes scholars say that this is  
<a onclick="modifyYTiframeseektime('7498')">2:04:58</a> shock  
<a onclick="modifyYTiframeseektime('7499')">2:04:59</a> as well by virtue of its rejection why  
<a onclick="modifyYTiframeseektime('7502')">2:05:02</a> because you have to you have to give  
<a onclick="modifyYTiframeseektime('7505')">2:05:05</a> those attributes  
<a onclick="modifyYTiframeseektime('7506')">2:05:06</a> implicitly or explicitly to something  
<a onclick="modifyYTiframeseektime('7507')">2:05:07</a> else so when you say there is no creator  
<a onclick="modifyYTiframeseektime('7510')">2:05:10</a> then you have to get the attribute of  
<a onclick="modifyYTiframeseektime('7512')">2:05:12</a> creating everything to something else  
<a onclick="modifyYTiframeseektime('7514')">2:05:14</a> right even if they say it came from  
<a onclick="modifyYTiframeseektime('7516')">2:05:16</a> nothing you're giving nothing that  
<a onclick="modifyYTiframeseektime('7518')">2:05:18</a> ability  
<a onclick="modifyYTiframeseektime('7518')">2:05:18</a> right so from that perspective  
<a onclick="modifyYTiframeseektime('7522')">2:05:22</a> is associationism as well because  
<a onclick="modifyYTiframeseektime('7524')">2:05:24</a> remember if you don't single out  
<a onclick="modifyYTiframeseektime('7526')">2:05:26</a> and direct all acts of worship to allah  
<a onclick="modifyYTiframeseektime('7528')">2:05:28</a> alone you're actually gonna  
<a onclick="modifyYTiframeseektime('7529')">2:05:29</a> you're gonna be doing it to something  
<a onclick="modifyYTiframeseektime('7530')">2:05:30</a> else so what's an act of worship  
<a onclick="modifyYTiframeseektime('7532')">2:05:32</a> an act of worship includes the internal  
<a onclick="modifyYTiframeseektime('7534')">2:05:34</a> acts of worship like the acts of the  
<a onclick="modifyYTiframeseektime('7535')">2:05:35</a> heart  
<a onclick="modifyYTiframeseektime('7536')">2:05:36</a> and the external acts of worship of the  
<a onclick="modifyYTiframeseektime('7538')">2:05:38</a> acts of the limbs so that  
<a onclick="modifyYTiframeseektime('7539')">2:05:39</a> internal acts of worship include  
<a onclick="modifyYTiframeseektime('7541')">2:05:41</a> ultimate love and ultimate gratitude and  
<a onclick="modifyYTiframeseektime('7543')">2:05:43</a> extensive praise  
<a onclick="modifyYTiframeseektime('7544')">2:05:44</a> if you don't believe in allah if you  
<a onclick="modifyYTiframeseektime('7546')">2:05:46</a> reject allah as an atheist you're going  
<a onclick="modifyYTiframeseektime('7548')">2:05:48</a> to give something your ultimate love  
<a onclick="modifyYTiframeseektime('7549')">2:05:49</a> other than allah  
<a onclick="modifyYTiframeseektime('7550')">2:05:50</a> you're going to give something your  
<a onclick="modifyYTiframeseektime('7551')">2:05:51</a> ultimate gratitude to other than allah  
<a onclick="modifyYTiframeseektime('7553')">2:05:53</a> and you're going to give something your  
<a onclick="modifyYTiframeseektime('7555')">2:05:55</a> ultimate extensive praise  
<a onclick="modifyYTiframeseektime('7557')">2:05:57</a> to other than allah so by virtue of that  
<a onclick="modifyYTiframeseektime('7561')">2:06:01</a> atheism is shook does that make sense  
<a onclick="modifyYTiframeseektime('7565')">2:06:05</a> i see what if someone is giving all of  
<a onclick="modifyYTiframeseektime('7567')">2:06:07</a> these uh things to just one thing  
<a onclick="modifyYTiframeseektime('7570')">2:06:10</a> that is not allah that's true right  
<a onclick="modifyYTiframeseektime('7572')">2:06:12</a> because it's other than allah your  
<a onclick="modifyYTiframeseektime('7574')">2:06:14</a> associationism so if they  
<a onclick="modifyYTiframeseektime('7576')">2:06:16</a> direct ultimate gratitude for example to  
<a onclick="modifyYTiframeseektime('7578')">2:06:18</a> the universe  
<a onclick="modifyYTiframeseektime('7579')">2:06:19</a> or the direct ultimate love to a living  
<a onclick="modifyYTiframeseektime('7581')">2:06:21</a> being or extensive praise to  
<a onclick="modifyYTiframeseektime('7583')">2:06:23</a> an idea or ideology other than allah  
<a onclick="modifyYTiframeseektime('7586')">2:06:26</a> that is also a form of shirk  
<a onclick="modifyYTiframeseektime('7588')">2:06:28</a> right because whatever the top of that  
<a onclick="modifyYTiframeseektime('7590')">2:06:30</a> value hierarchy  
<a onclick="modifyYTiframeseektime('7591')">2:06:31</a> if like allah should be at the top of it  
<a onclick="modifyYTiframeseektime('7594')">2:06:34</a> and if you stop believing in it it's a  
<a onclick="modifyYTiframeseektime('7596')">2:06:36</a> pyramid there's always  
<a onclick="modifyYTiframeseektime('7597')">2:06:37</a> if you put that at the bottom there's  
<a onclick="modifyYTiframeseektime('7599')">2:06:39</a> something new at the top of the pyramid  
<a onclick="modifyYTiframeseektime('7600')">2:06:40</a> it's not  
<a onclick="modifyYTiframeseektime('7601')">2:06:41</a> the pyramid just doesn't dissolve  
<a onclick="modifyYTiframeseektime('7602')">2:06:42</a> there's always something that's a  
<a onclick="modifyYTiframeseektime('7604')">2:06:44</a> beautiful way of doing it bro exactly  
<a onclick="modifyYTiframeseektime('7606')">2:06:46</a> okay thank you so much i appreciate it i

<a onclick="modifyYTiframeseektime('8101')">2:15:01</a> it was because of ramadan and your  
<a onclick="modifyYTiframeseektime('8104')">2:15:04</a> support that we're able to get more  
<a onclick="modifyYTiframeseektime('8105')">2:15:05</a> people on board  
<a onclick="modifyYTiframeseektime('8106')">2:15:06</a> we're able to expand and and so on and  
<a onclick="modifyYTiframeseektime('8109')">2:15:09</a> so forth because  
<a onclick="modifyYTiframeseektime('8110')">2:15:10</a> you have to understand that when a  
<a onclick="modifyYTiframeseektime('8111')">2:15:11</a> mentor gives their time they don't only  
<a onclick="modifyYTiframeseektime('8113')">2:15:13</a> give one hour  
<a onclick="modifyYTiframeseektime('8114')">2:15:14</a> uh a week they may give many hours a  
<a onclick="modifyYTiframeseektime('8116')">2:15:16</a> week nine hours or even maybe more  
<a onclick="modifyYTiframeseektime('8118')">2:15:18</a> and they have preparation time and there  
<a onclick="modifyYTiframeseektime('8120')">2:15:20</a> is post mentoring  
<a onclick="modifyYTiframeseektime('8122')">2:15:22</a> uh advice and and so on and so forth  
<a onclick="modifyYTiframeseektime('8124')">2:15:24</a> that can happen which takes a hell of a  
<a onclick="modifyYTiframeseektime('8126')">2:15:26</a> lot of time  
<a onclick="modifyYTiframeseektime('8127')">2:15:27</a> so we need dedicated people to help us  
<a onclick="modifyYTiframeseektime('8129')">2:15:29</a> expand now we're fully booked into  
<a onclick="modifyYTiframeseektime('8131')">2:15:31</a> september but we've got bookings until  
<a onclick="modifyYTiframeseektime('8133')">2:15:33</a> next year i believe  
<a onclick="modifyYTiframeseektime('8135')">2:15:35</a> uh it's very important for you to  
<a onclick="modifyYTiframeseektime('8137')">2:15:37</a> understand that this is a  
<a onclick="modifyYTiframeseektime('8139')">2:15:39</a> uh a unique service from the point of  
<a onclick="modifyYTiframeseektime('8141')">2:15:41</a> view that we're not only mentoring  
<a onclick="modifyYTiframeseektime('8142')">2:15:42</a> people to get involved in the dow and  
<a onclick="modifyYTiframeseektime('8144')">2:15:44</a> help them in the dialogue  
<a onclick="modifyYTiframeseektime('8145')">2:15:45</a> but we're also mentoring people  
<a onclick="modifyYTiframeseektime('8146')">2:15:46</a> considering their doubts their super  
<a onclick="modifyYTiframeseektime('8147')">2:15:47</a> hearts concerns  
<a onclick="modifyYTiframeseektime('8149')">2:15:49</a> so for example today i had an ad hoc  
<a onclick="modifyYTiframeseektime('8152')">2:15:52</a> mentoring  
<a onclick="modifyYTiframeseektime('8152')">2:15:52</a> we're not going to mention a lot of  
<a onclick="modifyYTiframeseektime('8154')">2:15:54</a> deals but you know  
<a onclick="modifyYTiframeseektime('8156')">2:15:56</a> if someone's son has some issues and  
<a onclick="modifyYTiframeseektime('8158')">2:15:58</a> we're basically  
<a onclick="modifyYTiframeseektime('8160')">2:16:00</a> taking them through that kind of  
<a onclick="modifyYTiframeseektime('8160')">2:16:00</a> mentoring process on how to deal with it  
<a onclick="modifyYTiframeseektime('8162')">2:16:02</a> with a very  
<a onclick="modifyYTiframeseektime('8163')">2:16:03</a> very very serious issue and uh  
<a onclick="modifyYTiframeseektime('8166')">2:16:06</a> you know this is the stuff that we do  
<a onclick="modifyYTiframeseektime('8167')">2:16:07</a> and you have to understand i spoke to  
<a onclick="modifyYTiframeseektime('8170')">2:16:10</a> um a leading day in america that we need  
<a onclick="modifyYTiframeseektime('8173')">2:16:13</a> this because  
<a onclick="modifyYTiframeseektime('8174')">2:16:14</a> we have answers we have the intellectual  
<a onclick="modifyYTiframeseektime('8176')">2:16:16</a> answers we have the institutes we  
<a onclick="modifyYTiframeseektime('8178')">2:16:18</a> have um all of these you know real  
<a onclick="modifyYTiframeseektime('8180')">2:16:20</a> philosophical answers we're standing on  
<a onclick="modifyYTiframeseektime('8182')">2:16:22</a> the shoulders of giants  
<a onclick="modifyYTiframeseektime('8183')">2:16:23</a> we have great work out there but what is  
<a onclick="modifyYTiframeseektime('8185')">2:16:25</a> missing is  
<a onclick="modifyYTiframeseektime('8186')">2:16:26</a> like a sunnah which is relating to  
<a onclick="modifyYTiframeseektime('8188')">2:16:28</a> people on one to one people can find  
<a onclick="modifyYTiframeseektime('8190')">2:16:30</a> answers online  
<a onclick="modifyYTiframeseektime('8191')">2:16:31</a> but there's like a hidden spiritual law  
<a onclick="modifyYTiframeseektime('8193')">2:16:33</a> if you like of dealing with people one  
<a onclick="modifyYTiframeseektime('8194')">2:16:34</a> to one like they could read something on  
<a onclick="modifyYTiframeseektime('8196')">2:16:36</a> the internet and have an abstract answer  
<a onclick="modifyYTiframeseektime('8198')">2:16:38</a> but when they're dealing with someone  
<a onclick="modifyYTiframeseektime('8200')">2:16:40</a> and someone understands the nuances the  
<a onclick="modifyYTiframeseektime('8202')">2:16:42</a> psychology  
<a onclick="modifyYTiframeseektime('8203')">2:16:43</a> the kind of emotions behind it taking  
<a onclick="modifyYTiframeseektime('8205')">2:16:45</a> them on that journey to get that answer  
<a onclick="modifyYTiframeseektime('8206')">2:16:46</a> internalized  
<a onclick="modifyYTiframeseektime('8208')">2:16:48</a> then that one-to-one process is  
<a onclick="modifyYTiframeseektime('8209')">2:16:49</a> absolutely beyond valuable  
<a onclick="modifyYTiframeseektime('8212')">2:16:52</a> and this is why yes it's hard we've made  
<a onclick="modifyYTiframeseektime('8214')">2:16:54</a> the decision to do this because you know  
<a onclick="modifyYTiframeseektime('8216')">2:16:56</a> if you want to think from a marketing  
<a onclick="modifyYTiframeseektime('8217')">2:16:57</a> and business strategy but that we're a  
<a onclick="modifyYTiframeseektime('8219')">2:16:59</a> business of course but if you have that  
<a onclick="modifyYTiframeseektime('8220')">2:17:00</a> mindset  
<a onclick="modifyYTiframeseektime('8221')">2:17:01</a> you won't do something like this because  
<a onclick="modifyYTiframeseektime('8223')">2:17:03</a> it takes a lot of resources and time and  
<a onclick="modifyYTiframeseektime('8225')">2:17:05</a> effort  
<a onclick="modifyYTiframeseektime('8225')">2:17:05</a> but we believe you have to follow the  
<a onclick="modifyYTiframeseektime('8227')">2:17:07</a> barakah forum the barakah  
<a onclick="modifyYTiframeseektime('8229')">2:17:09</a> is asking the question what does allah  
<a onclick="modifyYTiframeseektime('8230')">2:17:10</a> want from us and i truly believe  
<a onclick="modifyYTiframeseektime('8232')">2:17:12</a> in the dollar a game changer this post  
<a onclick="modifyYTiframeseektime('8235')">2:17:15</a> kind of online world the game changes  
<a onclick="modifyYTiframeseektime('8236')">2:17:16</a> not just writing stuff yes we need to  
<a onclick="modifyYTiframeseektime('8238')">2:17:18</a> provide intellectual content  
<a onclick="modifyYTiframeseektime('8239')">2:17:19</a> but it's having that one-to-one

<a onclick="modifyYTiframeseektime('8243')">2:17:23</a> a kind of sunnah of allah had to do with  
<a onclick="modifyYTiframeseektime('8246')">2:17:26</a> human beings  
<a onclick="modifyYTiframeseektime('8247')">2:17:27</a> and this is why allah not only said in  
<a onclick="modifyYTiframeseektime('8249')">2:17:29</a> the quran but we have a messenger

<a onclick="modifyYTiframeseektime('8268')">2:17:48</a> going to achieve that and with the
