Sharing Islam, truth & doubts:

Islam teaches that there are many meanings to events in one's life, and that it is up to the individual to find and give that meaning.

<a onclick="modifyYTiframeseektime('100')">0:01:40</a> but he leave that to you to to to tell  
<a onclick="modifyYTiframeseektime('103')">0:01:43</a> the audience yeah so the the overview  
<a onclick="modifyYTiframeseektime('107')">0:01:47</a> comes it's a good question to start off  
<a onclick="modifyYTiframeseektime('108')">0:01:48</a> with the overview is so as chaplain at  
<a onclick="modifyYTiframeseektime('111')">0:01:51</a> the University not in large part of my  
<a onclick="modifyYTiframeseektime('113')">0:01:53</a> responsibility is talking to students  
<a onclick="modifyYTiframeseektime('115')">0:01:55</a> and we wouldn't call it counseling we'll  
<a onclick="modifyYTiframeseektime('118')">0:01:58</a> be able to just have a chat with them  
<a onclick="modifyYTiframeseektime('119')">0:01:59</a> whether it's something emotional they're  
<a onclick="modifyYTiframeseektime('121')">0:02:01</a> struggling with something faithful A to  
<a onclick="modifyYTiframeseektime('122')">0:02:02</a> B the struggle and usually the chaplain  
<a onclick="modifyYTiframeseektime('124')">0:02:04</a> is not really equipped for higher  
<a onclick="modifyYTiframeseektime('126')">0:02:06</a> education in the chaplains usually are  
<a onclick="modifyYTiframeseektime('128')">0:02:08</a> in prisons and hospitals with a winter  
<a onclick="modifyYTiframeseektime('130')">0:02:10</a> spa you know  
<a onclick="modifyYTiframeseektime('132')">0:02:12</a> with bereavement emotional trauma things  
<a onclick="modifyYTiframeseektime('134')">0:02:14</a> like that but in a higher education  
<a onclick="modifyYTiframeseektime('136')">0:02:16</a> environment the challenge is not about  
<a onclick="modifyYTiframeseektime('138')">0:02:18</a> leading spinel and it's not really about  
<a onclick="modifyYTiframeseektime('140')">0:02:20</a> emotional trauma the real challenge is  
<a onclick="modifyYTiframeseektime('142')">0:02:22</a> the intellectual challenge is the  
<a onclick="modifyYTiframeseektime('144')">0:02:24</a> challenge of doubt and having been a  
<a onclick="modifyYTiframeseektime('147')">0:02:27</a> chaplain now for over a year and also  
<a onclick="modifyYTiframeseektime('150')">0:02:30</a> having traveled to other spamming  
<a onclick="modifyYTiframeseektime('151')">0:02:31</a> societies and other campuses in the UK  
<a onclick="modifyYTiframeseektime('153')">0:02:33</a> I've noticed that it's a rampant problem  
<a onclick="modifyYTiframeseektime('155')">0:02:35</a> is rife but it's also suppressed it's  
<a onclick="modifyYTiframeseektime('158')">0:02:38</a> under the cupboard and so the overview  
<a onclick="modifyYTiframeseektime('160')">0:02:40</a> of the problem is that when I started  
<a onclick="modifyYTiframeseektime('162')">0:02:42</a> chaplaincy I was quite shocked to  
<a onclick="modifyYTiframeseektime('164')">0:02:44</a> realize that the people who are coming  
<a onclick="modifyYTiframeseektime('165')">0:02:45</a> to me to deal with doubts in the basic  
<a onclick="modifyYTiframeseektime('167')">0:02:47</a> tenets of Islam were people on people  
<a onclick="modifyYTiframeseektime('171')">0:02:51</a> who were bearded systems were wearing  
<a onclick="modifyYTiframeseektime('173')">0:02:53</a> the hijab visibly practicing Muslims but  
<a onclick="modifyYTiframeseektime('176')">0:02:56</a> there is an invisible burden on their  
<a onclick="modifyYTiframeseektime('179')">0:02:59</a> shoulders and something that's consuming  
<a onclick="modifyYTiframeseektime('181')">0:03:01</a> their minds you know some people think  
<a onclick="modifyYTiframeseektime('183')">0:03:03</a> this is only true for students who are  
<a onclick="modifyYTiframeseektime('185')">0:03:05</a> studying philosophy and everybody else  
<a onclick="modifyYTiframeseektime('187')">0:03:07</a> is in noon actually it's not it's the  
<a onclick="modifyYTiframeseektime('189')">0:03:09</a> climate that you live they can't go a  
<a onclick="modifyYTiframeseektime('191')">0:03:11</a> day without in some way shape or form  
<a onclick="modifyYTiframeseektime('194')">0:03:14</a> being exposed to other ideologies other  
<a onclick="modifyYTiframeseektime('197')">0:03:17</a> belief systems and obviously the  
<a onclick="modifyYTiframeseektime('199')">0:03:19</a> question then comes back is what am i a  
<a onclick="modifyYTiframeseektime('201')">0:03:21</a> Muslim because of birth by my muslim by  
<a onclick="modifyYTiframeseektime('204')">0:03:24</a> culture by choice and when they start  
<a onclick="modifyYTiframeseektime('207')">0:03:27</a> questioning all of their initial  
<a onclick="modifyYTiframeseektime('208')">0:03:28</a> assumptions they realize I actually  
<a onclick="modifyYTiframeseektime('209')">0:03:29</a> don't know I don't know why I'm a Muslim  
<a onclick="modifyYTiframeseektime('212')">0:03:32</a> and that's when the the kind of the  
<a onclick="modifyYTiframeseektime('216')">0:03:36</a> problem begins that's when the the shock  
<a onclick="modifyYTiframeseektime('218')">0:03:38</a> begins - some of them I've had students  
<a onclick="modifyYTiframeseektime('220')">0:03:40</a> that leave the course drop out of  
<a onclick="modifyYTiframeseektime('221')">0:03:41</a> university starting with the  
<a onclick="modifyYTiframeseektime('223')">0:03:43</a> intellectual doubts I've had students  
<a onclick="modifyYTiframeseektime('225')">0:03:45</a> who stopped wearing the hijab just  
<a onclick="modifyYTiframeseektime('228')">0:03:48</a> starting with the doubt and so it starts  
<a onclick="modifyYTiframeseektime('230')">0:03:50</a> with one doubt one thought one idea it  
<a onclick="modifyYTiframeseektime('232')">0:03:52</a> festers it becomes a constant spread  
<a onclick="modifyYTiframeseektime('234')">0:03:54</a> consumes them sometimes they choose a  
<a onclick="modifyYTiframeseektime('236')">0:03:56</a> lot less - it's just a question someone  
<a onclick="modifyYTiframeseektime('238')">0:03:58</a> has the neither answer that wants to do  
<a onclick="modifyYTiframeseektime('239')">0:03:59</a> them the answer all the times people ask  
<a onclick="modifyYTiframeseektime('242')">0:04:02</a> you the question you give them a  
<a onclick="modifyYTiframeseektime('243')">0:04:03</a> non-standard a for another quick and  
<a onclick="modifyYTiframeseektime('244')">0:04:04</a> another and another and now these  
<a onclick="modifyYTiframeseektime('246')">0:04:06</a> questions are eating their mind Jin's  
<a onclick="modifyYTiframeseektime('247')">0:04:07</a> father they can't focus you know they're  
<a onclick="modifyYTiframeseektime('250')">0:04:10</a> crying they one particular practicing  
<a onclick="modifyYTiframeseektime('253')">0:04:13</a> student  
<a onclick="modifyYTiframeseektime('253')">0:04:13</a> equally would study for his exams in the  
<a onclick="modifyYTiframeseektime('255')">0:04:15</a> library because it's like someone was  
<a onclick="modifyYTiframeseektime('256')">0:04:16</a> talking to him in his head about - ready  
<a onclick="modifyYTiframeseektime('259')">0:04:19</a> to Islam so one thing for sure coming  
<a onclick="modifyYTiframeseektime('262')">0:04:22</a> after that is it's wrong to say these  
<a onclick="modifyYTiframeseektime('264')">0:04:24</a> are just intellectual problems  
<a onclick="modifyYTiframeseektime('265')">0:04:25</a> there's a psychological aspect this is  
<a onclick="modifyYTiframeseektime('267')">0:04:27</a> beautiful aspect there is the emotional  
<a onclick="modifyYTiframeseektime('269')">0:04:29</a> aspect there so like one pattern I  
<a onclick="modifyYTiframeseektime('271')">0:04:31</a> noticed the students who had like  
<a onclick="modifyYTiframeseektime('272')">0:04:32</a> emotional trauma growing up they tend to  
<a onclick="modifyYTiframeseektime('274')">0:04:34</a> be more susceptible to these kinds of  
<a onclick="modifyYTiframeseektime('276')">0:04:36</a> doubts they tend to feel a bit more lost  
<a onclick="modifyYTiframeseektime('278')">0:04:38</a> when they become stuck in the front and  
<a onclick="modifyYTiframeseektime('280')">0:04:40</a> one particular incident the one you  
<a onclick="modifyYTiframeseektime('282')">0:04:42</a> referred to possibly one of the most  
<a onclick="modifyYTiframeseektime('283')">0:04:43</a> shocking ones is a student who a Muslim  
<a onclick="modifyYTiframeseektime('287')">0:04:47</a> student committed suicide and family  
<a onclick="modifyYTiframeseektime('290')">0:04:50</a> give me permission to tell story buddies  
<a onclick="modifyYTiframeseektime('292')">0:04:52</a> most continue committing suicide and I  
<a onclick="modifyYTiframeseektime('294')">0:04:54</a> know that the what started all off was a  
<a onclick="modifyYTiframeseektime('296')">0:04:56</a> doubt the feeling that our practicing  
<a onclick="modifyYTiframeseektime('300')">0:05:00</a> Muslim brings pearlized at cetera  
<a onclick="modifyYTiframeseektime('302')">0:05:02</a> I don't know why I'm doing it some non  
<a onclick="modifyYTiframeseektime('305')">0:05:05</a> Muslim colleague asked him a question  
<a onclick="modifyYTiframeseektime('306')">0:05:06</a> about my faith he doesn't know the  
<a onclick="modifyYTiframeseektime('307')">0:05:07</a> answer to it and that's how it all  
<a onclick="modifyYTiframeseektime('308')">0:05:08</a> begins the problem is not knowing what  
<a onclick="modifyYTiframeseektime('310')">0:05:10</a> to do with the doubt Satan starting with  
<a onclick="modifyYTiframeseektime('313')">0:05:13</a> a doubt it becomes a cancer and when you  
<a onclick="modifyYTiframeseektime('316')">0:05:16</a> live your entire life seeing the world

<a onclick="modifyYTiframeseektime('360')">0:06:00</a> you call a doubt concerning the Islamic  
<a onclick="modifyYTiframeseektime('363')">0:06:03</a> tradition I would say conservative  
<a onclick="modifyYTiframeseektime('367')">0:06:07</a> estimate would be one-third estimate  
<a onclick="modifyYTiframeseektime('370')">0:06:10</a> would be one-third of Muslims have  
<a onclick="modifyYTiframeseektime('372')">0:06:12</a> doubts about their faith that they don't  
<a onclick="modifyYTiframeseektime('374')">0:06:14</a> have the confidence to ask they don't  
<a onclick="modifyYTiframeseektime('375')">0:06:15</a> all they don't know who to go to and  
<a onclick="modifyYTiframeseektime('377')">0:06:17</a> they kind of just push it aside thinking  
<a onclick="modifyYTiframeseektime('380')">0:06:20</a> I'll eventually deal with it or I'll get  
<a onclick="modifyYTiframeseektime('382')">0:06:22</a> there okay but it's affected them  
<a onclick="modifyYTiframeseektime('384')">0:06:24</a> already yeah so this leads us to a  
<a onclick="modifyYTiframeseektime('386')">0:06:26</a> really interesting point now so let's  
<a onclick="modifyYTiframeseektime('388')">0:06:28</a> really define what we mean by doubt here  
<a onclick="modifyYTiframeseektime('391')">0:06:31</a> because in the Islamic tradition there  
<a onclick="modifyYTiframeseektime('393')">0:06:33</a> is a difference between kind of  
<a onclick="modifyYTiframeseektime('395')">0:06:35</a> psycho-spiritual whisperings  
<a onclick="modifyYTiframeseektime('398')">0:06:38</a> and genuine intellectual doubts so I'm  
<a onclick="modifyYTiframeseektime('402')">0:06:42</a> assuming you've used the word out to  
<a onclick="modifyYTiframeseektime('404')">0:06:44</a> compass both but let's now allow you to  
<a onclick="modifyYTiframeseektime('407')">0:06:47</a> elaborate on the difference between the  
<a onclick="modifyYTiframeseektime('409')">0:06:49</a> two sure  
<a onclick="modifyYTiframeseektime('412')">0:06:52</a> the and we've seen this quite often  
<a onclick="modifyYTiframeseektime('414')">0:06:54</a> where a doubt turns into  
<a onclick="modifyYTiframeseektime('416')">0:06:56</a> psycho-spiritual but that to just make a  
<a onclick="modifyYTiframeseektime('418')">0:06:58</a> distinction between you know a doubt is  
<a onclick="modifyYTiframeseektime('421')">0:07:01</a> something you're not sure of and the  
<a onclick="modifyYTiframeseektime('423')">0:07:03</a> dangerous ones out when you're not sure  
<a onclick="modifyYTiframeseektime('425')">0:07:05</a> about something very fundamental to its  
<a onclick="modifyYTiframeseektime('427')">0:07:07</a> level you're not sure of whether God  
<a onclick="modifyYTiframeseektime('429')">0:07:09</a> exists or not sure is Muhammad the  
<a onclick="modifyYTiframeseektime('431')">0:07:11</a> Prophet or not I doubt is different from  
<a onclick="modifyYTiframeseektime('434')">0:07:14</a> a question a question is why did  
<a onclick="modifyYTiframeseektime('437')">0:07:17</a> so-and-so happen in the stomach  
<a onclick="modifyYTiframeseektime('438')">0:07:18</a> tradition in Islamic history but I still  
<a onclick="modifyYTiframeseektime('440')">0:07:20</a> retain my beliefs my Evoque morals and  
<a onclick="modifyYTiframeseektime('442')">0:07:22</a> values having King but when you're not  
<a onclick="modifyYTiframeseektime('445')">0:07:25</a> sure anymore about those initial things  
<a onclick="modifyYTiframeseektime('447')">0:07:27</a> that's when it becomes doubt on the  
<a onclick="modifyYTiframeseektime('451')">0:07:31</a> other hand psycho-spiritual whispering  
<a onclick="modifyYTiframeseektime('452')">0:07:32</a> is what we call West Western America is  
<a onclick="modifyYTiframeseektime('454')">0:07:34</a> when it's not just something you just  
<a onclick="modifyYTiframeseektime('457')">0:07:37</a> not sure of i but you're able to go on  
<a onclick="modifyYTiframeseektime('459')">0:07:39</a> with your daily life it's when that  
<a onclick="modifyYTiframeseektime('461')">0:07:41</a> question that you had of the thing  
<a onclick="modifyYTiframeseektime('463')">0:07:43</a> you're not sure about eventually takes  
<a onclick="modifyYTiframeseektime('465')">0:07:45</a> over your mind  
<a onclick="modifyYTiframeseektime('465')">0:07:45</a> so to speak you know you hear almost a  
<a onclick="modifyYTiframeseektime('468')">0:07:48</a> whispering in your head you're knocking  
<a onclick="modifyYTiframeseektime('469')">0:07:49</a> one you find the answer to one down only  
<a onclick="modifyYTiframeseektime('472')">0:07:52</a> to get another one popping up and it's  
<a onclick="modifyYTiframeseektime('474')">0:07:54</a> constantly bothering you it's it's  
<a onclick="modifyYTiframeseektime('476')">0:07:56</a> consuming and that you know you I find  
<a onclick="modifyYTiframeseektime('480')">0:08:00</a> that it starts with a doubt and I doubt  
<a onclick="modifyYTiframeseektime('481')">0:08:01</a> not dealt with then becomes a cancerous  
<a onclick="modifyYTiframeseektime('485')">0:08:05</a> okay so the distinction is being made  
<a onclick="modifyYTiframeseektime('488')">0:08:08</a> here is there are those doubts about  
<a onclick="modifyYTiframeseektime('490')">0:08:10</a> something that you aren't you're unsure  
<a onclick="modifyYTiframeseektime('491')">0:08:11</a> that you have a question about and it  
<a onclick="modifyYTiframeseektime('495')">0:08:15</a> refers generally speaking to the kind of  
<a onclick="modifyYTiframeseektime('497')">0:08:17</a> foundational aspects of Islam that would  
<a onclick="modifyYTiframeseektime('498')">0:08:18</a> change the basis of your value system  
<a onclick="modifyYTiframeseektime('500')">0:08:20</a> the basis very would you know that  
<a onclick="modifyYTiframeseektime('502')">0:08:22</a> serious doubts  
<a onclick="modifyYTiframeseektime('503')">0:08:23</a> yeah in that study different from having  
<a onclick="modifyYTiframeseektime('505')">0:08:25</a> a question about something like you know  
<a onclick="modifyYTiframeseektime('507')">0:08:27</a> I want to know about the preservation of  
<a onclick="modifyYTiframeseektime('510')">0:08:30</a> hadith okay not really knowing the  
<a onclick="modifyYTiframeseektime('512')">0:08:32</a> answer this moment doesn't really affect  
<a onclick="modifyYTiframeseektime('514')">0:08:34</a> my foundational worldview it doesn't  
<a onclick="modifyYTiframeseektime('516')">0:08:36</a> affect that my value system  
<a onclick="modifyYTiframeseektime('518')">0:08:38</a> I still have gained I still have  
<a onclick="modifyYTiframeseektime('520')">0:08:40</a> certainty in Islam it's just a question  
<a onclick="modifyYTiframeseektime('522')">0:08:42</a> I'm going to explore intellectually it's  
<a onclick="modifyYTiframeseektime('524')">0:08:44</a> virtually and I'm gonna access the  
<a onclick="modifyYTiframeseektime('526')">0:08:46</a> tradition to find an answer which is  
<a onclick="modifyYTiframeseektime('528')">0:08:48</a> very different to I doubt the  
<a onclick="modifyYTiframeseektime('530')">0:08:50</a> foundational  
<a onclick="modifyYTiframeseektime('531')">0:08:51</a> aspects of the tradition like God's  
<a onclick="modifyYTiframeseektime('532')">0:08:52</a> existence the miracle of the Quran and  
<a onclick="modifyYTiframeseektime('534')">0:08:54</a> the propagator of the public saw a lot  
<a onclick="modifyYTiframeseektime('536')">0:08:56</a> more I need to ascend them and other  
<a onclick="modifyYTiframeseektime('537')">0:08:57</a> aspects including the six pillars of  
<a onclick="modifyYTiframeseektime('540')">0:09:00</a> Eman right and then you said the  
<a onclick="modifyYTiframeseektime('542')">0:09:02</a> psycho-spiritual dow is the worst was  
<a onclick="modifyYTiframeseektime('544')">0:09:04</a> over that overcomes you  
<a onclick="modifyYTiframeseektime('546')">0:09:06</a> it basically engulfs you and you don't  
<a onclick="modifyYTiframeseektime('550')">0:09:10</a> have an answer and that really basically  
<a onclick="modifyYTiframeseektime('553')">0:09:13</a> fundamentally destroyed your kind of  
<a onclick="modifyYTiframeseektime('555')">0:09:15</a> spiritual and your psychological being  
<a onclick="modifyYTiframeseektime('557')">0:09:17</a> and it's not just intellectual that's  
<a onclick="modifyYTiframeseektime('559')">0:09:19</a> one modesty yes that the US was that  
<a onclick="modifyYTiframeseektime('561')">0:09:21</a> it's something that you could have  
<a onclick="modifyYTiframeseektime('562')">0:09:22</a> answered that question before I know the  
<a onclick="modifyYTiframeseektime('563')">0:09:23</a> answer this question mmm but it keeps  
<a onclick="modifyYTiframeseektime('565')">0:09:25</a> bugging least psychologically yes yeah  
<a onclick="modifyYTiframeseektime('570')">0:09:30</a> can you also say there is there is light  
<a onclick="modifyYTiframeseektime('572')">0:09:32</a> at the end of the tunnel even when it  
<a onclick="modifyYTiframeseektime('574')">0:09:34</a> comes to things like what was because  
<a onclick="modifyYTiframeseektime('577')">0:09:37</a> the Sahaba they would complain to the  
<a onclick="modifyYTiframeseektime('581')">0:09:41</a> promise of a lot more ie who would send  
<a onclick="modifyYTiframeseektime('582')">0:09:42</a> them to say you know they had things  
<a onclick="modifyYTiframeseektime('585')">0:09:45</a> that come in their mind that they didn't  
<a onclick="modifyYTiframeseektime('587')">0:09:47</a> want to answer right and the Prophet SAW  
<a onclick="modifyYTiframeseektime('590')">0:09:50</a> a love more ie who had said them  
<a onclick="modifyYTiframeseektime('591')">0:09:51</a> basically said to them this is a sign of  
<a onclick="modifyYTiframeseektime('593')">0:09:53</a> Eman so there is another type of wash  
<a onclick="modifyYTiframeseektime('596')">0:09:56</a> bursa which is well maybe you shouldn't  
<a onclick="modifyYTiframeseektime('599')">0:09:59</a> call it what what stuff because it is  
<a onclick="modifyYTiframeseektime('601')">0:10:01</a> not saying that's you know we it's not  
<a onclick="modifyYTiframeseektime('604')">0:10:04</a> just an understudy necessarily something  
<a onclick="modifyYTiframeseektime('606')">0:10:06</a> sinister right like some thoughts you  
<a onclick="modifyYTiframeseektime('608')">0:10:08</a> have you just would never share with  
<a onclick="modifyYTiframeseektime('609')">0:10:09</a> anyone Chris oh yeah it's like kind of a  
<a onclick="modifyYTiframeseektime('612')">0:10:12</a> mental whispering and mental  
<a onclick="modifyYTiframeseektime('614')">0:10:14</a> psychological whispering this so honover  
<a onclick="modifyYTiframeseektime('616')">0:10:16</a> they had them too however they had a  
<a onclick="modifyYTiframeseektime('620')">0:10:20</a> distinction they made a distinction  
<a onclick="modifyYTiframeseektime('622')">0:10:22</a> between the mental spiritual whispering  
<a onclick="modifyYTiframeseektime('625')">0:10:25</a> and who they were they said we don't  
<a onclick="modifyYTiframeseektime('627')">0:10:27</a> like this we don't believe in this we  
<a onclick="modifyYTiframeseektime('629')">0:10:29</a> know it's wrong but it's coming our  
<a onclick="modifyYTiframeseektime('631')">0:10:31</a> minds we're not gonna say anything when  
<a onclick="modifyYTiframeseektime('633')">0:10:33</a> of enactment and that's why the process  
<a onclick="modifyYTiframeseektime('636')">0:10:36</a> from said this is a sign of Iman now  
<a onclick="modifyYTiframeseektime('638')">0:10:38</a> when it comes to unhealthy  
<a onclick="modifyYTiframeseektime('641')">0:10:41</a> mental spiritual whisperings it's when  
<a onclick="modifyYTiframeseektime('643')">0:10:43</a> you start to adopt those mental  
<a onclick="modifyYTiframeseektime('647')">0:10:47</a> spiritual whisperings and engulf human  
<a onclick="modifyYTiframeseektime('650')">0:10:50</a> destroys you from that destroys your  
<a onclick="modifyYTiframeseektime('652')">0:10:52</a> well-being and I like to give a picture  
<a onclick="modifyYTiframeseektime('654')">0:10:54</a> sometimes that it's like your mind is  
<a onclick="modifyYTiframeseektime('657')">0:10:57</a> like a sky and there are clouds now the  
<a onclick="modifyYTiframeseektime('662')">0:11:02</a> clouds  
<a onclick="modifyYTiframeseektime('664')">0:11:04</a> they're not you right they're not part  
<a onclick="modifyYTiframeseektime('666')">0:11:06</a> of your mind per se just let them drift  
<a onclick="modifyYTiframeseektime('668')">0:11:08</a> parts of the heart that you look at that  
<a onclick="modifyYTiframeseektime('670')">0:11:10</a> cloud is not meant whisper to a spring  
<a onclick="modifyYTiframeseektime('672')">0:11:12</a> which I know is fundamentally wrong I  
<a onclick="modifyYTiframeseektime('674')">0:11:14</a> know it's not from me and I have a  
<a onclick="modifyYTiframeseektime('678')">0:11:18</a> psychological III don't like it right so  
<a onclick="modifyYTiframeseektime('683')">0:11:23</a> IIIi don't like that whispering i I it's  
<a onclick="modifyYTiframeseektime('686')">0:11:26</a> not part of me I know how to answer if I  
<a onclick="modifyYTiframeseektime('689')">0:11:29</a> still in my head and I'm not gonna talk  
<a onclick="modifyYTiframeseektime('692')">0:11:32</a> about it because I know is I'm making  
<a onclick="modifyYTiframeseektime('694')">0:11:34</a> the distinction you have this kind of  
<a onclick="modifyYTiframeseektime('695')">0:11:35</a> what's that word you use  
<a onclick="modifyYTiframeseektime('697')">0:11:37</a> you got a binary its external right but  
<a onclick="modifyYTiframeseektime('701')">0:11:41</a> they also hate it because they know it's  
<a onclick="modifyYTiframeseektime('702')">0:11:42</a> false they know it's not over them from  
<a onclick="modifyYTiframeseektime('705')">0:11:45</a> this it's a kind of mental spiritual  
<a onclick="modifyYTiframeseektime('707')">0:11:47</a> whispering and they just let it go pause  
<a onclick="modifyYTiframeseektime('710')">0:11:50</a> so let the cloud just drift away when it  
<a onclick="modifyYTiframeseektime('713')">0:11:53</a> comes to kind of the whispering that you  
<a onclick="modifyYTiframeseektime('714')">0:11:54</a> were talking about is when you now think  
<a onclick="modifyYTiframeseektime('716')">0:11:56</a> that cloud is you and it starts to rain  
<a onclick="modifyYTiframeseektime('719')">0:11:59</a> yeah yeah frequently what happens is  
<a onclick="modifyYTiframeseektime('722')">0:12:02</a> that when you once you start  
<a onclick="modifyYTiframeseektime('723')">0:12:03</a> internalizing it and saying these are my  
<a onclick="modifyYTiframeseektime('725')">0:12:05</a> thoughts and the next question is how  
<a onclick="modifyYTiframeseektime('728')">0:12:08</a> could I be thinking Steketee yes you  
<a onclick="modifyYTiframeseektime('730')">0:12:10</a> begin to doubt you're very like  
<a onclick="modifyYTiframeseektime('732')">0:12:12</a> existence your nature your morality like  
<a onclick="modifyYTiframeseektime('734')">0:12:14</a> am i a good person how could I be  
<a onclick="modifyYTiframeseektime('735')">0:12:15</a> thinking this about you know how could I  
<a onclick="modifyYTiframeseektime('737')">0:12:17</a> not be sure about the Prophet peace upon  
<a onclick="modifyYTiframeseektime('740')">0:12:20</a> his integrity yeah be as a Muslim so  
<a onclick="modifyYTiframeseektime('743')">0:12:23</a> when you start hating yourself  
<a onclick="modifyYTiframeseektime('745')">0:12:25</a> is when it all is that's one the black  
<a onclick="modifyYTiframeseektime('747')">0:12:27</a> hole turns up anything gets tucked in  
<a onclick="modifyYTiframeseektime('749')">0:12:29</a> because when it could turn becomes  
<a onclick="modifyYTiframeseektime('750')">0:12:30</a> self-loathing it becomes a vicious cycle  
<a onclick="modifyYTiframeseektime('753')">0:12:33</a> you hate yourself for the spot you don't  
<a onclick="modifyYTiframeseektime('755')">0:12:35</a> know how to solve it you get another  
<a onclick="modifyYTiframeseektime('756')">0:12:36</a> thought you hate the thought you hate  
<a onclick="modifyYTiframeseektime('758')">0:12:38</a> yourself and you become in this fire of  
<a onclick="modifyYTiframeseektime('760')">0:12:40</a> this downward spiral of just  
<a onclick="modifyYTiframeseektime('761')">0:12:41</a> self-loathing self-loathing and not  
<a onclick="modifyYTiframeseektime('763')">0:12:43</a> really hard to get out that's very  
<a onclick="modifyYTiframeseektime('766')">0:12:46</a> interesting and it's actually quite sad  
<a onclick="modifyYTiframeseektime('769')">0:12:49</a> as well because you can imagine that  
<a onclick="modifyYTiframeseektime('770')">0:12:50</a> person is just in this you know this  
<a onclick="modifyYTiframeseektime('773')">0:12:53</a> quagmire is darkness and they don't have  
<a onclick="modifyYTiframeseektime('776')">0:12:56</a> to get out of it so before we go into  
<a onclick="modifyYTiframeseektime('779')">0:12:59</a> the solutions then what are the sources  
<a onclick="modifyYTiframeseektime('781')">0:13:01</a> of these type of doubts what do you  
<a onclick="modifyYTiframeseektime('783')">0:13:03</a> think of the sources of the spiritual  
<a onclick="modifyYTiframeseektime('784')">0:13:04</a> type of doubts the what sorcerer what do  
<a onclick="modifyYTiframeseektime('786')">0:13:06</a> you think are the sources of the kind of  
<a onclick="modifyYTiframeseektime('788')">0:13:08</a> intellectual doubts the fundamental type  
<a onclick="modifyYTiframeseektime('791')">0:13:11</a> of doubts from your experience what  
<a onclick="modifyYTiframeseektime('793')">0:13:13</a> would they be so partly like one thing I  
<a onclick="modifyYTiframeseektime('797')">0:13:17</a> had to come  
<a onclick="modifyYTiframeseektime('797')">0:13:17</a> except is that we live in the global  
<a onclick="modifyYTiframeseektime('799')">0:13:19</a> village where if you're if your heart or  
<a onclick="modifyYTiframeseektime('801')">0:13:21</a> your mind is a bucket it's raining it's  
<a onclick="modifyYTiframeseektime('804')">0:13:24</a> raining and you've filled your bucket  
<a onclick="modifyYTiframeseektime('806')">0:13:26</a> with some basic morals and values but  
<a onclick="modifyYTiframeseektime('808')">0:13:28</a> everyone's throwing their bit as well so  
<a onclick="modifyYTiframeseektime('811')">0:13:31</a> you you can't really avoid being exposed  
<a onclick="modifyYTiframeseektime('814')">0:13:34</a> even possibly being exposed to people  
<a onclick="modifyYTiframeseektime('816')">0:13:36</a> attacking your  
<a onclick="modifyYTiframeseektime('817')">0:13:37</a> your metal beliefs and one of the things  
<a onclick="modifyYTiframeseektime('821')">0:13:41</a> one of the unfortunate realities is that  
<a onclick="modifyYTiframeseektime('823')">0:13:43</a> we're not prepared for that fraught in  
<a onclick="modifyYTiframeseektime('825')">0:13:45</a> terms of upbringing inch powdered so one  
<a onclick="modifyYTiframeseektime('827')">0:13:47</a> of the things you mentioned before in  
<a onclick="modifyYTiframeseektime('828')">0:13:48</a> previous conversation is why don't  
<a onclick="modifyYTiframeseektime('830')">0:13:50</a> parents talk to their children about why  
<a onclick="modifyYTiframeseektime('832')">0:13:52</a> we worship Allah and if if a parent were

<a onclick="modifyYTiframeseektime('889')">0:14:49</a> they're not on certain types of

<a onclick="modifyYTiframeseektime('894')">0:14:54</a> before and that begins sometimes the

<a onclick="modifyYTiframeseektime('899')">0:14:59</a> when a person is ready and with students  
<a onclick="modifyYTiframeseektime('901')">0:15:01</a> in particular one of the greatest  
<a onclick="modifyYTiframeseektime('903')">0:15:03</a> sources of doubt is YouTube I would say  
<a onclick="modifyYTiframeseektime('905')">0:15:05</a> from my anecdotal experience no survey  
<a onclick="modifyYTiframeseektime('908')">0:15:08</a> but I would say 80 to 90 percent of

<a onclick="modifyYTiframeseektime('912')">0:15:12</a> really reading books nowadays especially

<a onclick="modifyYTiframeseektime('923')">0:15:23</a> humble opinion in my little experience  
<a onclick="modifyYTiframeseektime('926')">0:15:26</a> it's obviously conversations with  
<a onclick="modifyYTiframeseektime('929')">0:15:29</a> colleagues and friends come in contact  
<a onclick="modifyYTiframeseektime('930')">0:15:30</a> with know  
<a onclick="modifyYTiframeseektime('931')">0:15:31</a> things maybe the drop in a sheltered  
<a onclick="modifyYTiframeseektime('932')">0:15:32</a> environment non-muslim ask them a  
<a onclick="modifyYTiframeseektime('934')">0:15:34</a> question about their faith they don't  
<a onclick="modifyYTiframeseektime('935')">0:15:35</a> know how to respond and that's where it  
<a onclick="modifyYTiframeseektime('936')">0:15:36</a> begins but the majority of the time  
<a onclick="modifyYTiframeseektime('938')">0:15:38</a> going to YouTube and kind of getting  
<a onclick="modifyYTiframeseektime('942')">0:15:42</a> bits and backs about the faith and not  
<a onclick="modifyYTiframeseektime('944')">0:15:44</a> having a structured worldview and I'm  
<a onclick="modifyYTiframeseektime('946')">0:15:46</a> not having anybody build their blocks  
<a onclick="modifyYTiframeseektime('948')">0:15:48</a> but getting random bits information  
<a onclick="modifyYTiframeseektime('950')">0:15:50</a> sometimes which confuses them further  
<a onclick="modifyYTiframeseektime('951')">0:15:51</a> you know so they learn a bit about you  
<a onclick="modifyYTiframeseektime('954')">0:15:54</a> know Islam's relationship with slavery  
<a onclick="modifyYTiframeseektime('955')">0:15:55</a> and they like that just raises more  
<a onclick="modifyYTiframeseektime('958')">0:15:58</a> questions in my mind now it's not really  
<a onclick="modifyYTiframeseektime('959')">0:15:59</a> settled mmm  
<a onclick="modifyYTiframeseektime('962')">0:16:02</a> so I've stayed - in summary it's the  
<a onclick="modifyYTiframeseektime('964')">0:16:04</a> climate living the upbringing of parents  
<a onclick="modifyYTiframeseektime('966')">0:16:06</a> the lack of a foundation it's YouTube  
<a onclick="modifyYTiframeseektime('969')">0:16:09</a> and content and it's also just being in  
<a onclick="modifyYTiframeseektime('971')">0:16:11</a> contact with the wider world with  
<a onclick="modifyYTiframeseektime('972')">0:16:12</a> colleagues and so that would be  
<a onclick="modifyYTiframeseektime('975')">0:16:15</a> basically the source of maybe  
<a onclick="modifyYTiframeseektime('977')">0:16:17</a> intellectual type of dollars without  
<a onclick="modifyYTiframeseektime('979')">0:16:19</a> about the tradition itself so it's the  
<a onclick="modifyYTiframeseektime('982')">0:16:22</a> social media aspect YouTube is the  
<a onclick="modifyYTiframeseektime('984')">0:16:24</a> environment kind of Global Village we  
<a onclick="modifyYTiframeseektime('986')">0:16:26</a> live in we live in a kind of you know  
<a onclick="modifyYTiframeseektime('989')">0:16:29</a> marketplace of competing ideologies and  
<a onclick="modifyYTiframeseektime('991')">0:16:31</a> values and ideas and it's inevitable  
<a onclick="modifyYTiframeseektime('993')">0:16:33</a> that we're going to have these questions  
<a onclick="modifyYTiframeseektime('994')">0:16:34</a> okay so that's one source what about the  
<a onclick="modifyYTiframeseektime('998')">0:16:38</a> source of the type of the wasp Oh sir  
<a onclick="modifyYTiframeseektime('1000')">0:16:40</a> thank you you did too early about  
<a onclick="modifyYTiframeseektime('1003')">0:16:43</a> relationship with parents and maybe not  
<a onclick="modifyYTiframeseektime('1005')">0:16:45</a> having a good grounding at home maybe  
<a onclick="modifyYTiframeseektime('1008')">0:16:48</a> they don't have a good connection with a  
<a onclick="modifyYTiframeseektime('1011')">0:16:51</a> loss hannah water I know they don't pray  
<a onclick="modifyYTiframeseektime('1013')">0:16:53</a> for example so give us some of those  
<a onclick="modifyYTiframeseektime('1014')">0:16:54</a> typos yeah that's and I would say that  
<a onclick="modifyYTiframeseektime('1018')">0:16:58</a> the West Coast aspect is perhaps the  
<a onclick="modifyYTiframeseektime('1020')">0:17:00</a> most really dangerous in how impacts a  
<a onclick="modifyYTiframeseektime('1023')">0:17:03</a> person's entire life I've seen two broad  
<a onclick="modifyYTiframeseektime('1026')">0:17:06</a> sources of in my conversation like  
<a onclick="modifyYTiframeseektime('1029')">0:17:09</a> somebody comes they have like serious  
<a onclick="modifyYTiframeseektime('1032')">0:17:12</a> doubt they don't you know why they exist  
<a onclick="modifyYTiframeseektime('1033')">0:17:13</a> you know existential pain they don't no  
<a onclick="modifyYTiframeseektime('1035')">0:17:15</a> one here does a lot I don't know anymore  
<a onclick="modifyYTiframeseektime('1037')">0:17:17</a> anything anymore when I as I have that  
<a onclick="modifyYTiframeseektime('1039')">0:17:19</a> conversation as I dig deeper and deeper  
<a onclick="modifyYTiframeseektime('1041')">0:17:21</a> why they have those doubts what are  
<a onclick="modifyYTiframeseektime('1042')">0:17:22</a> those questions it eventually gets to  
<a onclick="modifyYTiframeseektime('1045')">0:17:25</a> one of two things either one they've  
<a onclick="modifyYTiframeseektime('1048')">0:17:28</a> been through some really bad form a  
<a onclick="modifyYTiframeseektime('1050')">0:17:30</a> growing up they have a compliment  
<a onclick="modifyYTiframeseektime('1052')">0:17:32</a> abusive Hospital they're going through  
<a onclick="modifyYTiframeseektime('1054')">0:17:34</a> some emotional comment that one a parent  
<a onclick="modifyYTiframeseektime('1056')">0:17:36</a> is blackmailing them parents to  
<a onclick="modifyYTiframeseektime('1058')">0:17:38</a> physically abuse them then contract  
<a onclick="modifyYTiframeseektime('1060')">0:17:40</a> abused in their childhood it's a tractor  
<a onclick="modifyYTiframeseektime('1061')">0:17:41</a> that's one stops they don't have a  
<a onclick="modifyYTiframeseektime('1064')">0:17:44</a> stable  
<a onclick="modifyYTiframeseektime('1064')">0:17:44</a> sense of self they don't have a stable  
<a onclick="modifyYTiframeseektime('1067')">0:17:47</a> you kind of feeling of who am i what am  
<a onclick="modifyYTiframeseektime('1069')">0:17:49</a> i worth etcetera etcetera and the other  
<a onclick="modifyYTiframeseektime('1073')">0:17:53</a> source is weak spirituality and so a lot  
<a onclick="modifyYTiframeseektime('1077')">0:17:57</a> of these doubts are on things that  
<a onclick="modifyYTiframeseektime('1079')">0:17:59</a> they've been they've had a firm belief  
<a onclick="modifyYTiframeseektime('1080')">0:18:00</a> in the entire life beyond rational  
<a onclick="modifyYTiframeseektime('1082')">0:18:02</a> ground blindly not blindly on rational  
<a onclick="modifyYTiframeseektime('1085')">0:18:05</a> growth but it's at that time when they  
<a onclick="modifyYTiframeseektime('1087')">0:18:07</a> stopped praying for gel for three weeks  
<a onclick="modifyYTiframeseektime('1089')">0:18:09</a> in a row they stopped coming to JAMA a  
<a onclick="modifyYTiframeseektime('1091')">0:18:11</a> couple of weeks maybe they go to the pub  
<a onclick="modifyYTiframeseektime('1093')">0:18:13</a> with a couple of friends and there's not  
<a onclick="modifyYTiframeseektime('1094')">0:18:14</a> really mind people drinking around them  
<a onclick="modifyYTiframeseektime('1096')">0:18:16</a> and they just they feel a bit  
<a onclick="modifyYTiframeseektime('1097')">0:18:17</a> comfortable like you know what's wrong  
<a onclick="modifyYTiframeseektime('1099')">0:18:19</a> really with people drinking and that's  
<a onclick="modifyYTiframeseektime('1100')">0:18:20</a> what it begins is it's the the deeper  
<a onclick="modifyYTiframeseektime('1104')">0:18:24</a> connection with Allah with God himself  
<a onclick="modifyYTiframeseektime('1106')">0:18:26</a> when that begins to wane and weaken we  
<a onclick="modifyYTiframeseektime('1110')">0:18:30</a> have to realize that your teen or the  
<a onclick="modifyYTiframeseektime('1111')">0:18:31</a> certainty asked holding something to be  
<a onclick="modifyYTiframeseektime('1114')">0:18:34</a> true is not purely intellectual reality  
<a onclick="modifyYTiframeseektime('1116')">0:18:36</a> it's not something that we just read  
<a onclick="modifyYTiframeseektime('1117')">0:18:37</a> stable magnet that makes sense  
<a onclick="modifyYTiframeseektime('1119')">0:18:39</a> it's also it's also a spirituality that  
<a onclick="modifyYTiframeseektime('1122')">0:18:42</a> comes in and we know like we discussed  
<a onclick="modifyYTiframeseektime('1124')">0:18:44</a> this about the prophets campaign of what  
<a onclick="modifyYTiframeseektime('1126')">0:18:46</a> custody Compu pleased with when when  
<a onclick="modifyYTiframeseektime('1129')">0:18:49</a> some companions were describing it so  
<a onclick="modifyYTiframeseektime('1130')">0:18:50</a> why was he so special  
<a onclick="modifyYTiframeseektime('1132')">0:18:52</a> all depicted companion so why was he  
<a onclick="modifyYTiframeseektime('1133')">0:18:53</a> given that place he was given this it  
<a onclick="modifyYTiframeseektime('1135')">0:18:55</a> wasn't except because we say in what  
<a onclick="modifyYTiframeseektime('1137')">0:18:57</a> colorful holiday to translate the Arabic  
<a onclick="modifyYTiframeseektime('1139')">0:18:59</a> because there was something certain that  
<a onclick="modifyYTiframeseektime('1141')">0:19:01</a> settled into his heart there was a  
<a onclick="modifyYTiframeseektime('1143')">0:19:03</a> spiritual conviction that gave them the  
<a onclick="modifyYTiframeseektime('1146')">0:19:06</a> strength to be able to face anything in  
<a onclick="modifyYTiframeseektime('1148')">0:19:08</a> the path of God and so when that's  
<a onclick="modifyYTiframeseektime('1150')">0:19:10</a> bridge to a conviction I'll give you an  
<a onclick="modifyYTiframeseektime('1151')">0:19:11</a> example like if you were to ask you know  
<a onclick="modifyYTiframeseektime('1155')">0:19:15</a> if you go to a desert Arabia you asked a  
<a onclick="modifyYTiframeseektime('1156')">0:19:16</a> Bedouin Arab  
<a onclick="modifyYTiframeseektime('1157')">0:19:17</a> why do you believe in a God he won't be

<a onclick="modifyYTiframeseektime('1160')">0:19:20</a> argument but he's like this is the most  
<a onclick="modifyYTiframeseektime('1164')">0:19:24</a> certain thing in my life I've  
<a onclick="modifyYTiframeseektime('1165')">0:19:25</a> experienced God I have a just feeling I  
<a onclick="modifyYTiframeseektime('1169')">0:19:29</a> have a spiritual connection with him I  
<a onclick="modifyYTiframeseektime('1170')">0:19:30</a> felt him in the last set of the nighter  
<a onclick="modifyYTiframeseektime('1172')">0:19:32</a> I felt obviously that's not his only  
<a onclick="modifyYTiframeseektime('1174')">0:19:34</a> reason but it's an additional it's a  
<a onclick="modifyYTiframeseektime('1177')">0:19:37</a> component of his belief that's  
<a onclick="modifyYTiframeseektime('1178')">0:19:38</a> unshakable you can't move him you know  
<a onclick="modifyYTiframeseektime('1181')">0:19:41</a> and it's that very thing that makes him  
<a onclick="modifyYTiframeseektime('1183')">0:19:43</a> you know if someone comes in offers him  
<a onclick="modifyYTiframeseektime('1184')">0:19:44</a> a bad deal is gone you know make some  
<a onclick="modifyYTiframeseektime('1186')">0:19:46</a> money by doing something unethical is  
<a onclick="modifyYTiframeseektime('1187')">0:19:47</a> like no way my my sustenance come from  
<a onclick="modifyYTiframeseektime('1190')">0:19:50</a> God is that unwavering unshakable faith  
<a onclick="modifyYTiframeseektime('1193')">0:19:53</a> it's not purely based on rationality but  
<a onclick="modifyYTiframeseektime('1194')">0:19:54</a> also based on a a spiritual experience  
<a onclick="modifyYTiframeseektime('1197')">0:19:57</a> so when that I've noticed for exactly in  
<a onclick="modifyYTiframeseektime('1200')">0:20:00</a> a couple of students they had the exams  
<a onclick="modifyYTiframeseektime('1202')">0:20:02</a> in Ramallah okay student XA Mohammad he  
<a onclick="modifyYTiframeseektime('1206')">0:20:06</a> had exams in Ramadan he thought this

<a onclick="modifyYTiframeseektime('1209')">0:20:09</a> a photo out there that lets me break my

<a onclick="modifyYTiframeseektime('1219')">0:20:19</a> that's the first step towards almost  
<a onclick="modifyYTiframeseektime('1221')">0:20:21</a> kind of breaking away from God from his

<a onclick="modifyYTiframeseektime('1224')">0:20:24</a> it's his first disobedience if his first

<a onclick="modifyYTiframeseektime('1229')">0:20:29</a> feeling of I don't really care what God  
<a onclick="modifyYTiframeseektime('1231')">0:20:31</a> wants and as the days go by his Hut  
<a onclick="modifyYTiframeseektime('1234')">0:20:34</a> grows harder and harder reminders from

<a onclick="modifyYTiframeseektime('1333')">0:22:13</a> brought in conviction made him go round

<a onclick="modifyYTiframeseektime('1374')">0:22:54</a> and therefore we have to have a holistic  
<a onclick="modifyYTiframeseektime('1376')">0:22:56</a> approach to these issues because  
<a onclick="modifyYTiframeseektime('1378')">0:22:58</a> sometimes unfortunately in the social  
<a onclick="modifyYTiframeseektime('1381')">0:23:01</a> media everyone is on this kind of  
<a onclick="modifyYTiframeseektime('1384')">0:23:04</a> intellectual arrogance flex here's a  
<a onclick="modifyYTiframeseektime('1386')">0:23:06</a> question I have to answer it  
<a onclick="modifyYTiframeseektime('1388')">0:23:08</a> and that's not a lot about us and about  
<a onclick="modifyYTiframeseektime('1390')">0:23:10</a> own phobia and our own disposition and  
<a onclick="modifyYTiframeseektime('1393')">0:23:13</a> our own alignment with the psychological  
<a onclick="modifyYTiframeseektime('1398')">0:23:18</a> approach of the prophet sallallaahu ayah  
<a onclick="modifyYTiframeseektime('1400')">0:23:20</a> he was sending because not every  
<a onclick="modifyYTiframeseektime('1402')">0:23:22</a> question requires an answer not every  
<a onclick="modifyYTiframeseektime('1404')">0:23:24</a> intellectual question requires an answer  
<a onclick="modifyYTiframeseektime('1406')">0:23:26</a> because sometimes the sit over  
<a onclick="modifyYTiframeseektime('1408')">0:23:28</a> underlying cause I remember you know I  
<a onclick="modifyYTiframeseektime('1411')">0:23:31</a> had this Pakistani atheist come up to me  
<a onclick="modifyYTiframeseektime('1414')">0:23:34</a> at one University and he basically said  
<a onclick="modifyYTiframeseektime('1417')">0:23:37</a> that I did a master's in quantum physics  
<a onclick="modifyYTiframeseektime('1420')">0:23:40</a> right and okay fair enough but then he  
<a onclick="modifyYTiframeseektime('1424')">0:23:44</a> asked me this he didn't ask me a  
<a onclick="modifyYTiframeseektime('1425')">0:23:45</a> question he said your argument for good  
<a onclick="modifyYTiframeseektime('1427')">0:23:47</a> the good existence doesn't make sense  
<a onclick="modifyYTiframeseektime('1429')">0:23:49</a> because causality doesn't make sense  
<a onclick="modifyYTiframeseektime('1433')">0:23:53</a> outside of the universe now look you  
<a onclick="modifyYTiframeseektime('1435')">0:23:55</a> know I have a philosophical kind of  
<a onclick="modifyYTiframeseektime('1437')">0:23:57</a> understanding I could have given him the  
<a onclick="modifyYTiframeseektime('1439')">0:23:59</a> Kantian argument I've got to give him  
<a onclick="modifyYTiframeseektime('1441')">0:24:01</a> you know expose his philosophical  
<a onclick="modifyYTiframeseektime('1445')">0:24:05</a> presupposition that he believes that  
<a onclick="modifyYTiframeseektime('1446')">0:24:06</a> causality is derived for experience I  
<a onclick="modifyYTiframeseektime('1448')">0:24:08</a> could have I could have turned the  
<a onclick="modifyYTiframeseektime('1449')">0:24:09</a> tables on him but I didn't what I said  
<a onclick="modifyYTiframeseektime('1452')">0:24:12</a> was is what do you mean by a causality  
<a onclick="modifyYTiframeseektime('1456')">0:24:16</a> and where if you study Western medicine  
<a onclick="modifyYTiframeseektime('1460')">0:24:20</a> they haven't ironed out what is the  
<a onclick="modifyYTiframeseektime('1461')">0:24:21</a> nature of the co2  
<a onclick="modifyYTiframeseektime('1463')">0:24:23</a> so he basically ends up saying I don't  
<a onclick="modifyYTiframeseektime('1466')">0:24:26</a> know and I said to him isn't it very  
<a onclick="modifyYTiframeseektime('1469')">0:24:29</a> interesting that you're using a keyword  
<a onclick="modifyYTiframeseektime('1471')">0:24:31</a> in a sentence to deny God and you don't  
<a onclick="modifyYTiframeseektime('1475')">0:24:35</a> know what that word means I said what's  
<a onclick="modifyYTiframeseektime('1477')">0:24:37</a> up bro so I tried to connect with him  
<a onclick="modifyYTiframeseektime('1479')">0:24:39</a> sat him down and you know what he said  
<a onclick="modifyYTiframeseektime('1480')">0:24:40</a> to me he said I didn't know how to  
<a onclick="modifyYTiframeseektime('1484')">0:24:44</a> connect with Allah I didn't pray hope  
<a onclick="modifyYTiframeseektime('1486')">0:24:46</a> they didn't know how to connect with it  
<a onclick="modifyYTiframeseektime('1487')">0:24:47</a> with Allah subhana WA Ta'ala  
<a onclick="modifyYTiframeseektime('1490')">0:24:50</a> that's the apparent reason the story of  
<a onclick="modifyYTiframeseektime('1492')">0:24:52</a> a while ago but that is quite telling  
<a onclick="modifyYTiframeseektime('1494')">0:24:54</a> another example was in my town someone  
<a onclick="modifyYTiframeseektime('1497')">0:24:57</a> says to me I was truly a debate of Louis  
<a onclick="modifyYTiframeseektime('1499')">0:24:59</a> Krouse it was a great debate I'm still  
<a onclick="modifyYTiframeseektime('1501')">0:25:01</a> an atheist you know what I said to him  
<a onclick="modifyYTiframeseektime('1503')">0:25:03</a> was it him cause your parents bro he  
<a onclick="modifyYTiframeseektime('1506')">0:25:06</a> just he spoke to me for a few minutes  
<a onclick="modifyYTiframeseektime('1508')">0:25:08</a> talking about the kind of darkness of  
<a onclick="modifyYTiframeseektime('1511')">0:25:11</a> his upbringing from I remember so he's  
<a onclick="modifyYTiframeseektime('1514')">0:25:14</a> kind of a tease name or rejection of  
<a onclick="modifyYTiframeseektime('1516')">0:25:16</a> Allah didn't have anything to do with  
<a onclick="modifyYTiframeseektime('1518')">0:25:18</a> the question itself or his kind of  
<a onclick="modifyYTiframeseektime('1520')">0:25:20</a> youthful new identity or any kind of  
<a onclick="modifyYTiframeseektime('1522')">0:25:22</a> intellectual question it was probably to  
<a onclick="modifyYTiframeseektime('1524')">0:25:24</a> do with some kind of psychodynamic end  
<a onclick="modifyYTiframeseektime('1525')">0:25:25</a> of it there's a real interesting I took  
<a onclick="modifyYTiframeseektime('1528')">0:25:28</a> my believe I forgot the name of the  
<a onclick="modifyYTiframeseektime('1532')">0:25:32</a> author it's on your pain Institute and  
<a onclick="modifyYTiframeseektime('1534')">0:25:34</a> it's about doubts and parenting and the  
<a onclick="modifyYTiframeseektime('1537')">0:25:37</a> author she cites a really good reference  
<a onclick="modifyYTiframeseektime('1540')">0:25:40</a> on you know the parents not pretending  
<a onclick="modifyYTiframeseektime('1544')">0:25:44</a> telling their children what to do  
<a onclick="modifyYTiframeseektime('1546')">0:25:46</a> concerning religious matters but not  
<a onclick="modifyYTiframeseektime('1547')">0:25:47</a> following it themselves can be a source  
<a onclick="modifyYTiframeseektime('1550')">0:25:50</a> of doubt later on in the upbringing of  
<a onclick="modifyYTiframeseektime('1552')">0:25:52</a> the child over the child develops into  
<a onclick="modifyYTiframeseektime('1554')">0:25:54</a> being a young adult so so I just wanted  
<a onclick="modifyYTiframeseektime('1559')">0:25:59</a> to give those examples because you're  
<a onclick="modifyYTiframeseektime('1560')">0:26:00</a> actually right leads me to another  
<a onclick="modifyYTiframeseektime('1562')">0:26:02</a> question which is I just wanted to say  
<a onclick="modifyYTiframeseektime('1565')">0:26:05</a> about that one thing I'm sorry on that  
<a onclick="modifyYTiframeseektime('1568')">0:26:08</a> thing about the law I would say in terms  
<a onclick="modifyYTiframeseektime('1570')">0:26:10</a> of if if the home is one of the largest  
<a onclick="modifyYTiframeseektime('1573')">0:26:13</a> factors giving giving people serious  
<a onclick="modifyYTiframeseektime('1576')">0:26:16</a> time in themselves and in their beliefs  
<a onclick="modifyYTiframeseektime('1577')">0:26:17</a> in terms of the home one is obviously  
<a onclick="modifyYTiframeseektime('1580')">0:26:20</a> the broken home  
<a onclick="modifyYTiframeseektime('1581')">0:26:21</a> that's probably the worst kind of has  
<a onclick="modifyYTiframeseektime('1584')">0:26:24</a> arrested them but also hypocrisy the  
<a onclick="modifyYTiframeseektime('1586')">0:26:26</a> hypocrisy of a parent child may observe  
<a onclick="modifyYTiframeseektime('1590')">0:26:30</a> it and not say anything about it but  
<a onclick="modifyYTiframeseektime('1592')">0:26:32</a> it's perhaps one of the greatest causes  
<a onclick="modifyYTiframeseektime('1594')">0:26:34</a> of the confusion in likely  
<a onclick="modifyYTiframeseektime('1596')">0:26:36</a> I remember like teaching in a small

<a onclick="modifyYTiframeseektime('1610')">0:26:50</a> up for Fedya the morning don't pray  
<a onclick="modifyYTiframeseektime('1612')">0:26:52</a> yesterday and my parents said go back to  
<a onclick="modifyYTiframeseektime('1614')">0:26:54</a> sleep because you've got the parents  
<a onclick="modifyYTiframeseektime('1617')">0:26:57</a> come on apparently they say my sons  
<a onclick="modifyYTiframeseektime('1619')">0:26:59</a> learned everything he knows this stuff

<a onclick="modifyYTiframeseektime('1623')">0:27:03</a> I asked him you know so him still what  
<a onclick="modifyYTiframeseektime('1626')">0:27:06</a> is it that I taught you about the five  
<a onclick="modifyYTiframeseektime('1627')">0:27:07</a> prayers because you taught me well blast  
<a onclick="modifyYTiframeseektime('1629')">0:27:09</a> it what why isn't it you were more able  
<a onclick="modifyYTiframeseektime('1630')">0:27:10</a> to practice it at home and the parents  
<a onclick="modifyYTiframeseektime('1633')">0:27:13</a> face was red and the parent knows I said  
<a onclick="modifyYTiframeseektime('1636')">0:27:16</a> but then I let the parent you can send

<a onclick="modifyYTiframeseektime('1660')">0:27:40</a> here's the big question now from your

<a onclick="modifyYTiframeseektime('2058')">0:34:18</a> was the mindset that allowed him to do

<a onclick="modifyYTiframeseektime('2077')">0:34:37</a> they've been through in terms of prison  
<a onclick="modifyYTiframeseektime('2079')">0:34:39</a> and expose the way they're able to look  
<a onclick="modifyYTiframeseektime('2081')">0:34:41</a> back and I know personally that one of  
<a onclick="modifyYTiframeseektime('2083')">0:34:43</a> the greatest reasons he's able to see  
<a onclick="modifyYTiframeseektime('2085')">0:34:45</a> with the different perspective is his

<a onclick="modifyYTiframeseektime('2089')">0:34:49</a> and so it's it's that and what you're  
<a onclick="modifyYTiframeseektime('2094')">0:34:54</a> mentioning is actually from my personal  
<a onclick="modifyYTiframeseektime('2095')">0:34:55</a> perspective in the top three reasons  
<a onclick="modifyYTiframeseektime('2098')">0:34:58</a> that most young Muslims leave Islam  
<a onclick="modifyYTiframeseektime('2101')">0:35:01</a> suffering or misunderstanding are still  
<a onclick="modifyYTiframeseektime('2104')">0:35:04</a> taking the wrong Phoenix just and that's  
<a onclick="modifyYTiframeseektime('2106')">0:35:06</a> how you think about it go ahead go ahead  
<a onclick="modifyYTiframeseektime('2109')">0:35:09</a> but sometimes we have you know Muslim  
<a onclick="modifyYTiframeseektime('2111')">0:35:11</a> students at any age they would present  
<a onclick="modifyYTiframeseektime('2114')">0:35:14</a> intellectual questions that they could  
<a onclick="modifyYTiframeseektime('2116')">0:35:16</a> probably answer themselves if they did a  
<a onclick="modifyYTiframeseektime('2118')">0:35:18</a> little bit of reading or what a book but  
<a onclick="modifyYTiframeseektime('2122')">0:35:22</a> they still have that question as a kind  
<a onclick="modifyYTiframeseektime('2124')">0:35:24</a> of you know veil that is hiding really  
<a onclick="modifyYTiframeseektime('2127')">0:35:27</a> what's happening which is  
<a onclick="modifyYTiframeseektime('2130')">0:35:30</a> these past experiences relationships how  
<a onclick="modifyYTiframeseektime('2134')">0:35:34</a> they relate to their parents how they  
<a onclick="modifyYTiframeseektime('2135')">0:35:35</a> relate to themselves you know lack of  
<a onclick="modifyYTiframeseektime('2137')">0:35:37</a> self-esteem so those things are very  
<a onclick="modifyYTiframeseektime('2139')">0:35:39</a> important and the reason I'm emphasizing  
<a onclick="modifyYTiframeseektime('2141')">0:35:41</a> this is because though art people like  
<a onclick="modifyYTiframeseektime('2144')">0:35:44</a> to share Islam on the public domain this  
<a onclick="modifyYTiframeseektime('2147')">0:35:47</a> approach is not common like to do with  
<a onclick="modifyYTiframeseektime('2152')">0:35:52</a> human beings your fellow Muslim even  
<a onclick="modifyYTiframeseektime('2154')">0:35:54</a> non-muslims in a very kind of impact ik  
<a onclick="modifyYTiframeseektime('2156')">0:35:56</a> way the way of the prophet sallallahu  
<a onclick="modifyYTiframeseektime('2159')">0:35:59</a> alayhi wa send them to imaginatively  
<a onclick="modifyYTiframeseektime('2161')">0:36:01</a> experience what they experience of  
<a onclick="modifyYTiframeseektime('2163')">0:36:03</a> feeling what they're feeling to walk in  
<a onclick="modifyYTiframeseektime('2165')">0:36:05</a> their shoes so and and that's why I  
<a onclick="modifyYTiframeseektime('2168')">0:36:08</a> would like to emphasize is extremely  
<a onclick="modifyYTiframeseektime('2170')">0:36:10</a> important to engage with people that way  
<a onclick="modifyYTiframeseektime('2172')">0:36:12</a> because we know that you know answering  
<a onclick="modifyYTiframeseektime('2176')">0:36:16</a> intellectual questions on is not going  
<a onclick="modifyYTiframeseektime('2178')">0:36:18</a> to create an awakening it might do but  
<a onclick="modifyYTiframeseektime('2180')">0:36:20</a> it could be something else you know I  
<a onclick="modifyYTiframeseektime('2182')">0:36:22</a> think we had a discussion previously on  
<a onclick="modifyYTiframeseektime('2184')">0:36:24</a> the concept of Islamic epistemology like  
<a onclick="modifyYTiframeseektime('2187')">0:36:27</a> you know what is the human being the  
<a onclick="modifyYTiframeseektime('2189')">0:36:29</a> human being has a pit Rock has an innate

<a onclick="modifyYTiframeseektime('2194')">0:36:34</a> disposition is you know proper forms of  
<a onclick="modifyYTiframeseektime('2197')">0:36:37</a> knowledge but Allah is a reality that  
<a onclick="modifyYTiframeseektime('2199')">0:36:39</a> he's worthy of praise and he's worthy of  
<a onclick="modifyYTiframeseektime('2201')">0:36:41</a> worship but that gets crowded you know  
<a onclick="modifyYTiframeseektime('2204')">0:36:44</a> you go to chapter 13 verse 30 you go to  
<a onclick="modifyYTiframeseektime('2206')">0:36:46</a> the I didn't study Muslim was quite

<a onclick="modifyYTiframeseektime('2251')">0:37:31</a> way to find out is to empathize and  
<a onclick="modifyYTiframeseektime('2253')">0:37:33</a> choose question and probe human being  
<a onclick="modifyYTiframeseektime('2255')">0:37:35</a> with that person and then you may

<a onclick="modifyYTiframeseektime('2617')">0:43:37</a> unpack there but as a as a general point  
<a onclick="modifyYTiframeseektime('2620')">0:43:40</a> you know look look at the suffering and  
<a onclick="modifyYTiframeseektime('2623')">0:43:43</a> the kind of you know maybe the the

<a onclick="modifyYTiframeseektime('2760')">0:46:00</a> may have to come to the confusion that  
<a onclick="modifyYTiframeseektime('2762')">0:46:02</a> it's not about answering all the  
<a onclick="modifyYTiframeseektime('2763')">0:46:03</a> questions because why if you answer all  
<a onclick="modifyYTiframeseektime('2766')">0:46:06</a> the questions what have you assumed that  
<a onclick="modifyYTiframeseektime('2768')">0:46:08</a> there's going to be another question

<a onclick="modifyYTiframeseektime('2790')">0:46:30</a> carriageway right with something that's  
<a onclick="modifyYTiframeseektime('2794')">0:46:34</a> so powerful that is so deep because  
<a onclick="modifyYTiframeseektime('2796')">0:46:36</a> don't get me wrong we have to answer  
<a onclick="modifyYTiframeseektime('2798')">0:46:38</a> questions resolved but it has to be done  
<a onclick="modifyYTiframeseektime('2800')">0:46:40</a> in a way that's so empowering that takes  
<a onclick="modifyYTiframeseektime('2803')">0:46:43</a> the person on the journey so they can  
<a onclick="modifyYTiframeseektime('2805')">0:46:45</a> become their own intellectual spiritual  
<a onclick="modifyYTiframeseektime('2808')">0:46:48</a> leader in their own way yes you still  
<a onclick="modifyYTiframeseektime('2809')">0:46:49</a> have to have really mad and we have to  
<a onclick="modifyYTiframeseektime('2811')">0:46:51</a> be at their feet and study with them and  
<a onclick="modifyYTiframeseektime('2813')">0:46:53</a> all of that stuff but generally speaking  
<a onclick="modifyYTiframeseektime('2815')">0:46:55</a> you must have some kind of sense of  
<a onclick="modifyYTiframeseektime('2819')">0:46:59</a> stability rather than waiting for the

<a onclick="modifyYTiframeseektime('2823')">0:47:03</a> YouTube so we could be satisfied and  
<a onclick="modifyYTiframeseektime('2825')">0:47:05</a> thing is they don't have access to you  
<a onclick="modifyYTiframeseektime('2827')">0:47:07</a> guys as well right you know I on campus  
<a onclick="modifyYTiframeseektime('2830')">0:47:10</a> there are maybe between 500 and a

<a onclick="modifyYTiframeseektime('2839')">0:47:19</a> then they have access to people like you  
<a onclick="modifyYTiframeseektime('2841')">0:47:21</a> know Imams and messiahs perhaps in the

<a onclick="modifyYTiframeseektime('2850')">0:47:30</a> have access to you so all they have  
<a onclick="modifyYTiframeseektime('2852')">0:47:32</a> access is to sell hundreds videos

<a onclick="modifyYTiframeseektime('2868')">0:47:48</a> you don't know the reward unlike you see  
<a onclick="modifyYTiframeseektime('2870')">0:47:50</a> from the may Allah give us this day and  
<a onclick="modifyYTiframeseektime('2871')">0:47:51</a> they're like yeah but then they have a  
<a onclick="modifyYTiframeseektime('2875')">0:47:55</a> dependency now on you they need hamza  
<a onclick="modifyYTiframeseektime('2877')">0:47:57</a> now i have second answer where is he one  
<a onclick="modifyYTiframeseektime('2881')">0:48:01</a> thing that we have failed myself the  
<a onclick="modifyYTiframeseektime('2886')">0:48:06</a> famous speakers people who like you know  
<a onclick="modifyYTiframeseektime('2889')">0:48:09</a> about huge YouTube channels people are  
<a onclick="modifyYTiframeseektime('2891')">0:48:11</a> involved in this air of work and massive  
<a onclick="modifyYTiframeseektime('2893')">0:48:13</a> failure is not creating leaders why mean  
<a onclick="modifyYTiframeseektime('2899')">0:48:19</a> by that is not illegal at their famous  
<a onclick="modifyYTiframeseektime('2902')">0:48:22</a> but elite that they could take  
<a onclick="modifyYTiframeseektime('2903')">0:48:23</a> leadership over their own life and over  
<a onclick="modifyYTiframeseektime('2907')">0:48:27</a> their own kind of intellectual spiritual  
<a onclick="modifyYTiframeseektime('2910')">0:48:30</a> certainty where they don't have to wait  
<a onclick="modifyYTiframeseektime('2913')">0:48:33</a> for the next YouTube clip for a question  
<a onclick="modifyYTiframeseektime('2915')">0:48:35</a> to the answer but they have a solid  
<a onclick="modifyYTiframeseektime('2918')">0:48:38</a> foundation and grounding and they can  
<a onclick="modifyYTiframeseektime('2920')">0:48:40</a> distinguish between questions that are  
<a onclick="modifyYTiframeseektime('2922')">0:48:42</a> nice to have  
<a onclick="modifyYTiframeseektime('2923')">0:48:43</a> answered yeah but they don't really  
<a onclick="modifyYTiframeseektime('2925')">0:48:45</a> fundamentally undermine my spiritual  
<a onclick="modifyYTiframeseektime('2928')">0:48:48</a> intellectual well-being and questions  
<a onclick="modifyYTiframeseektime('2931')">0:48:51</a> that need to be solved and I now have  
<a onclick="modifyYTiframeseektime('2933')">0:48:53</a> the tools and I am empowered to take to  
<a onclick="modifyYTiframeseektime('2937')">0:48:57</a> walk on that path to try and solve those  
<a onclick="modifyYTiframeseektime('2939')">0:48:59</a> issues myself but what we've done we  
<a onclick="modifyYTiframeseektime('2942')">0:49:02</a> created this kind of crazy celebrity  
<a onclick="modifyYTiframeseektime('2946')">0:49:06</a> type of dependency of speakers and  
<a onclick="modifyYTiframeseektime('2948')">0:49:08</a> YouTube when the next question was the  
<a onclick="modifyYTiframeseektime('2950')">0:49:10</a> next next answer and that kind of  
<a onclick="modifyYTiframeseektime('2953')">0:49:13</a> narrative must create a social construct  
<a onclick="modifyYTiframeseektime('2955')">0:49:15</a> that keeps us dependent on those people  
<a onclick="modifyYTiframeseektime('2958')">0:49:18</a> yeah the analogy was almost you know how  
<a onclick="modifyYTiframeseektime('2962')">0:49:22</a> we deal with healthcare in the West you  
<a onclick="modifyYTiframeseektime('2964')">0:49:24</a> know a lot of people every little flu I  
<a onclick="modifyYTiframeseektime('2966')">0:49:26</a> have see the doctor you go to the east  
<a onclick="modifyYTiframeseektime('2968')">0:49:28</a> Eastern traditions it's very  
<a onclick="modifyYTiframeseektime('2970')">0:49:30</a> self-service or I'll make the soup I've  
<a onclick="modifyYTiframeseektime('2972')">0:49:32</a> got this mystic powder that goes into  
<a onclick="modifyYTiframeseektime('2974')">0:49:34</a> this water I'll take care of my stuff  
<a onclick="modifyYTiframeseektime('2976')">0:49:36</a> you know it's also a key to the idea of  
<a onclick="modifyYTiframeseektime('2979')">0:49:39</a> creating first stages you know a doctors  
<a onclick="modifyYTiframeseektime('2982')">0:49:42</a> can't do everything but the first ADA is  
<a onclick="modifyYTiframeseektime('2985')">0:49:45</a> able to deal with certain emergency  
<a onclick="modifyYTiframeseektime('2986')">0:49:46</a> instance to create people who just have  
<a onclick="modifyYTiframeseektime('2989')">0:49:49</a> some basic principles with which they  
<a onclick="modifyYTiframeseektime('2990')">0:49:50</a> have the mindset of being able to deal  
<a onclick="modifyYTiframeseektime('2992')">0:49:52</a> with their own task and helping even  
<a onclick="modifyYTiframeseektime('2993')">0:49:53</a> their immediate circles we need a  
<a onclick="modifyYTiframeseektime('2996')">0:49:56</a> hundred thousand of those first stages  
<a onclick="modifyYTiframeseektime('2997')">0:49:57</a> intellectual first stages so how do you  
<a onclick="modifyYTiframeseektime('3002')">0:50:02</a> do with this what do you you have an  
<a onclick="modifyYTiframeseektime('3004')">0:50:04</a> approach so what's your approach to this  
<a onclick="modifyYTiframeseektime('3007')">0:50:07</a> kind of so when I when I talk to  
<a onclick="modifyYTiframeseektime('3011')">0:50:11</a> university students and in some  
<a onclick="modifyYTiframeseektime('3013')">0:50:13</a> presentations Hispanic societies I  
<a onclick="modifyYTiframeseektime('3015')">0:50:15</a> offered like kind of a process of how to  
<a onclick="modifyYTiframeseektime('3018')">0:50:18</a> deal with the doubt um the first one is  
<a onclick="modifyYTiframeseektime('3021')">0:50:21</a> to assess something in there they're  
<a onclick="modifyYTiframeseektime('3022')">0:50:22</a> called Rondon with a fairly healing work  
<a onclick="modifyYTiframeseektime('3024')">0:50:24</a> to link something or doubtful about back  
<a onclick="modifyYTiframeseektime('3029')">0:50:29</a> to this kind of basic principle you are  
<a onclick="modifyYTiframeseektime('3031')">0:50:31</a> very sure about so say for example let's  
<a onclick="modifyYTiframeseektime('3033')">0:50:33</a> take a to make it clear you're not sure  
<a onclick="modifyYTiframeseektime('3037')">0:50:37</a> about say for example why do the Prophet  
<a onclick="modifyYTiframeseektime('3041')">0:50:41</a> Muhammad peace be upon him do X Y Z you  
<a onclick="modifyYTiframeseektime('3043')">0:50:43</a> a question and why did he do this it  
<a onclick="modifyYTiframeseektime('3045')">0:50:45</a> seems a bit unjust now this is a  
<a onclick="modifyYTiframeseektime('3049')">0:50:49</a> question mark right your doubt probably  
<a onclick="modifyYTiframeseektime('3051')">0:50:51</a> but what are you absolutely sure from  
<a onclick="modifyYTiframeseektime('3053')">0:50:53</a> your upbringing from what you've read  
<a onclick="modifyYTiframeseektime('3054')">0:50:54</a> from what you understand is a  
<a onclick="modifyYTiframeseektime('3056')">0:50:56</a> the character of this man Muhammad peace  
<a onclick="modifyYTiframeseektime('3057')">0:50:57</a> upon his expression by the witness  
<a onclick="modifyYTiframeseektime('3060')">0:51:00</a> testimony of his own friends by those of  
<a onclick="modifyYTiframeseektime('3062')">0:51:02</a> his foes by non-muslim intellect  
<a onclick="modifyYTiframeseektime('3065')">0:51:05</a> everyone just testifies for this man's  
<a onclick="modifyYTiframeseektime('3066')">0:51:06</a> character what I'm absolutely sure of is  
<a onclick="modifyYTiframeseektime('3069')">0:51:09</a> he was an exception here that's what I'm  
<a onclick="modifyYTiframeseektime('3071')">0:51:11</a> not sure of is this little incident so I  
<a onclick="modifyYTiframeseektime('3074')">0:51:14</a> will find an answer to this incident  
<a onclick="modifyYTiframeseektime('3076')">0:51:16</a> eventually but I am still sure about his  
<a onclick="modifyYTiframeseektime('3078')">0:51:18</a> exception and until I find overwhelming  
<a onclick="modifyYTiframeseektime('3081')">0:51:21</a> evidence that that is false  
<a onclick="modifyYTiframeseektime('3082')">0:51:22</a> I'm not going to throw the baby out with  
<a onclick="modifyYTiframeseektime('3084')">0:51:24</a> the bathwater I'm going to find answer  
<a onclick="modifyYTiframeseektime('3087')">0:51:27</a> inshallah I will ask the Christian  
<a onclick="modifyYTiframeseektime('3089')">0:51:29</a> community who has got this a source of  
<a onclick="modifyYTiframeseektime('3091')">0:51:31</a> knowledge if you don't know I will ask  
<a onclick="modifyYTiframeseektime('3092')">0:51:32</a> but first I have to reassure as I say  
<a onclick="modifyYTiframeseektime('3095')">0:51:35</a> that's the first step reassure yourself  
<a onclick="modifyYTiframeseektime('3097')">0:51:37</a> of your fundamentals no foundation maybe  
<a onclick="modifyYTiframeseektime('3100')">0:51:40</a> you realize I don't have foundation  
<a onclick="modifyYTiframeseektime('3101')">0:51:41</a> there's a crisis maybe we have to  
<a onclick="modifyYTiframeseektime('3104')">0:51:44</a> revisit maybe we have to go back to the  
<a onclick="modifyYTiframeseektime('3106')">0:51:46</a> Quran for example surah kahf is one  
<a onclick="modifyYTiframeseektime('3108')">0:51:48</a> particular chapter in the Quran I  
<a onclick="modifyYTiframeseektime('3109')">0:51:49</a> recommend for those who feel like they  
<a onclick="modifyYTiframeseektime('3111')">0:51:51</a> don't really have the firm foundations  
<a onclick="modifyYTiframeseektime('3112')">0:51:52</a> of belief to go back to God himself

<a onclick="modifyYTiframeseektime('3129')">0:52:09</a> and reflect what do I know to be true  
<a onclick="modifyYTiframeseektime('3131')">0:52:11</a> all right this thing I'm not sure about  
<a onclick="modifyYTiframeseektime('3133')">0:52:13</a> one thing I am sure for 1400 years  
<a onclick="modifyYTiframeseektime('3135')">0:52:15</a> someone has come up with this question  
<a onclick="modifyYTiframeseektime('3136')">0:52:16</a> and there is an answer but I'm not gonna  
<a onclick="modifyYTiframeseektime('3139')">0:52:19</a> baby up with a lot that's the first

<a onclick="modifyYTiframeseektime('3147')">0:52:27</a> doubt to override certainty so you focus  
<a onclick="modifyYTiframeseektime('3152')">0:52:32</a> on what's fundamental so you can apply  
<a onclick="modifyYTiframeseektime('3154')">0:52:34</a> this to anything for example why is the

<a onclick="modifyYTiframeseektime('3175')">0:52:55</a> so we know that's the case so just  
<a onclick="modifyYTiframeseektime('3179')">0:52:59</a> because we've been over to answer

<a onclick="modifyYTiframeseektime('3215')">0:53:35</a> questioned God when Ibrahim the Prophet  
<a onclick="modifyYTiframeseektime('3217')">0:53:37</a> Abraham says to God from being in kafir  
<a onclick="modifyYTiframeseektime('3220')">0:53:40</a> to promote I've gone she told me how he  
<a onclick="modifyYTiframeseektime('3222')">0:53:42</a> resurrected it God says I'll well that  
<a onclick="modifyYTiframeseektime('3224')">0:53:44</a> took me do you not believe  
<a onclick="modifyYTiframeseektime('3225')">0:53:45</a> have you not got faith no matter what I  
<a onclick="modifyYTiframeseektime('3228')">0:53:48</a> can be up to my enough fun be I just  
<a onclick="modifyYTiframeseektime('3229')">0:53:49</a> want to find contentment in my heart he  
<a onclick="modifyYTiframeseektime('3231')">0:53:51</a> wants to see other to your pain he was  
<a onclick="modifyYTiframeseektime('3233')">0:53:53</a> on his level of me because seeing is not  
<a onclick="modifyYTiframeseektime('3235')">0:53:55</a> the same as believing so haven't been  
<a onclick="modifyYTiframeseektime('3237')">0:53:57</a> comfortable that I've got a question and  
<a onclick="modifyYTiframeseektime('3238')">0:53:58</a> it's just going to increase my my kind  
<a onclick="modifyYTiframeseektime('3241')">0:54:01</a> of belief my foundation very interesting  
<a onclick="modifyYTiframeseektime('3243')">0:54:03</a> point so if you see asking questions  
<a onclick="modifyYTiframeseektime('3247')">0:54:07</a> from that perspective it's not about  
<a onclick="modifyYTiframeseektime('3250')">0:54:10</a> becoming certain it's about increasing  
<a onclick="modifyYTiframeseektime('3253')">0:54:13</a> my different levels of certainty because  
<a onclick="modifyYTiframeseektime('3255')">0:54:15</a> in the panic of all yes there are three  
<a onclick="modifyYTiframeseektime('3257')">0:54:17</a> main levels of certainty you have a  
<a onclick="modifyYTiframeseektime('3260')">0:54:20</a> madea pain which is the yeah pain of  
<a onclick="modifyYTiframeseektime('3262')">0:54:22</a> knowledge you have I know yet pain the  
<a onclick="modifyYTiframeseektime('3263')">0:54:23</a> pain of seeing and the happen yeah pain  
<a onclick="modifyYTiframeseektime('3265')">0:54:25</a> which is it's part of your own reality  
<a onclick="modifyYTiframeseektime('3269')">0:54:29</a> meaning you know say someone tells you  
<a onclick="modifyYTiframeseektime('3272')">0:54:32</a> by a text and you trust them that your  
<a onclick="modifyYTiframeseektime('3275')">0:54:35</a> next-door neighbor's house is on fire  
<a onclick="modifyYTiframeseektime('3276')">0:54:36</a> that's anybody a pain I walk outside of  
<a onclick="modifyYTiframeseektime('3280')">0:54:40</a> the door and I look up the houses on  
<a onclick="modifyYTiframeseektime('3282')">0:54:42</a> fire  
<a onclick="modifyYTiframeseektime('3282')">0:54:42</a> that's ionia pain the pain of seeing it  
<a onclick="modifyYTiframeseektime('3285')">0:54:45</a> right and what happened appears I'm in  
<a onclick="modifyYTiframeseektime('3288')">0:54:48</a> their house and it's on fire and I could  
<a onclick="modifyYTiframeseektime('3290')">0:54:50</a> feel yeah yeah yeah 34 different levels  
<a onclick="modifyYTiframeseektime('3294')">0:54:54</a> of certainty so that very way of seeing  
<a onclick="modifyYTiframeseektime('3296')">0:54:56</a> it you have yuppie intellectual culture  
<a onclick="modifyYTiframeseektime('3300')">0:55:00</a> conviction I'm just increasing the  
<a onclick="modifyYTiframeseektime('3302')">0:55:02</a> levels of my conviction through these  
<a onclick="modifyYTiframeseektime('3303')">0:55:03</a> questions if I have strong foundations  
<a onclick="modifyYTiframeseektime('3306')">0:55:06</a> so this is why it's so important to keep  
<a onclick="modifyYTiframeseektime('3309')">0:55:09</a> on reinforcing the foundations so people  
<a onclick="modifyYTiframeseektime('3312')">0:55:12</a> could anchor off that and when they do  
<a onclick="modifyYTiframeseektime('3313')">0:55:13</a> these questions they'll be like why not  
<a onclick="modifyYTiframeseektime('3315')">0:55:15</a> what's certain here and I can continue  
<a onclick="modifyYTiframeseektime('3318')">0:55:18</a> my journey to increase that certainty  
<a onclick="modifyYTiframeseektime('3319')">0:55:19</a> rather than trying to find certainty  
<a onclick="modifyYTiframeseektime('3322')">0:55:22</a> right this is why the problematic nature  
<a onclick="modifyYTiframeseektime('3325')">0:55:25</a> of which wanna answer the questions to  
<a onclick="modifyYTiframeseektime('3328')">0:55:28</a> someone who doesn't have the foundations  
<a onclick="modifyYTiframeseektime('3329')">0:55:29</a> would create that kind of vicious circle  
<a onclick="modifyYTiframeseektime('3332')">0:55:32</a> of doubts and even maybe traumatic  
<a onclick="modifyYTiframeseektime('3336')">0:55:36</a> spiritual experience of not being to  
<a onclick="modifyYTiframeseektime('3338')">0:55:38</a> find that that their space and their  
<a onclick="modifyYTiframeseektime('3340')">0:55:40</a> place in the world and this existential  
<a onclick="modifyYTiframeseektime('3342')">0:55:42</a> anxiety so tell us more about the your  
<a onclick="modifyYTiframeseektime('3347')">0:55:47</a> foundational teachings because I want to  
<a onclick="modifyYTiframeseektime('3351')">0:55:51</a> talk about you now and Link this whole  
<a onclick="modifyYTiframeseektime('3353')">0:55:53</a> doubts things to what your what would  
<a onclick="modifyYTiframeseektime('3355')">0:55:55</a> you do in your in your public work  
<a onclick="modifyYTiframeseektime('3357')">0:55:57</a> recently you had around twenty thirty or  
<a onclick="modifyYTiframeseektime('3361')">0:56:01</a> thirty thirty over the code to tell us  
<a onclick="modifyYTiframeseektime('3363')">0:56:03</a> about that any course that you're  
<a onclick="modifyYTiframeseektime('3365')">0:56:05</a> developing  
<a onclick="modifyYTiframeseektime('3365')">0:56:05</a> bitesize tell us as well about you know  
<a onclick="modifyYTiframeseektime('3369')">0:56:09</a> the other things that you've been doing  
<a onclick="modifyYTiframeseektime('3371')">0:56:11</a> to create those foundations for the the  
<a onclick="modifyYTiframeseektime('3374')">0:56:14</a> Muslims so they're able to basically  
<a onclick="modifyYTiframeseektime('3376')">0:56:16</a> start from a position of certainty then  
<a onclick="modifyYTiframeseektime('3378')">0:56:18</a> start increasing this sure I've been in  
<a onclick="modifyYTiframeseektime('3383')">0:56:23</a> my chaplaincy work I've been constantly  
<a onclick="modifyYTiframeseektime('3384')">0:56:24</a> perplexed by the level of doubt that I'm  
<a onclick="modifyYTiframeseektime('3387')">0:56:27</a> seeing and the level of Sirius Star  
<a onclick="modifyYTiframeseektime('3390')">0:56:30</a> people leaving the faith people just  
<a onclick="modifyYTiframeseektime('3392')">0:56:32</a> kind of losing hope people dropping out  
<a onclick="modifyYTiframeseektime('3395')">0:56:35</a> of university et cetera cetera and on  
<a onclick="modifyYTiframeseektime('3396')">0:56:36</a> the last year's been playing on my mind  
<a onclick="modifyYTiframeseektime('3398')">0:56:38</a> was the solution was my solution is my  
<a onclick="modifyYTiframeseektime('3401')">0:56:41</a> solution to give them a few answer to  
<a onclick="modifyYTiframeseektime('3403')">0:56:43</a> the question is well I'm not teaching  
<a onclick="modifyYTiframeseektime('3404')">0:56:44</a> the man to fish I'm giving him fish and  
<a onclick="modifyYTiframeseektime('3405')">0:56:45</a> if he's going back hungry for more he's  
<a onclick="modifyYTiframeseektime('3407')">0:56:47</a> going to be hungry he's got a hungry  
<a onclick="modifyYTiframeseektime('3408')">0:56:48</a> belly um so what I eventually did was I  
<a onclick="modifyYTiframeseektime('3411')">0:56:51</a> thought then Easter  
<a onclick="modifyYTiframeseektime('3413')">0:56:53</a> someone needs to be able to set up these  
<a onclick="modifyYTiframeseektime('3415')">0:56:55</a> foundations and give me the University  
<a onclick="modifyYTiframeseektime('3417')">0:56:57</a> students with the attention span of  
<a onclick="modifyYTiframeseektime('3419')">0:56:59</a> goldfish they're always on their phones  
<a onclick="modifyYTiframeseektime('3421')">0:57:01</a> it needs to be bite-size you know I  
<a onclick="modifyYTiframeseektime('3425')">0:57:05</a> remember once like telling student to go  
<a onclick="modifyYTiframeseektime('3428')">0:57:08</a> and watch a certain speakers see a lot  
<a onclick="modifyYTiframeseektime('3430')">0:57:10</a> of videos in order to answer some  
<a onclick="modifyYTiframeseektime('3431')">0:57:11</a> questions um and he immediately went  
<a onclick="modifyYTiframeseektime('3434')">0:57:14</a> from a message me instead brav the video  
<a onclick="modifyYTiframeseektime('3437')">0:57:17</a> is two hours long I can't do this thing  
<a onclick="modifyYTiframeseektime('3440')">0:57:20</a> this is the language you know that's  
<a onclick="modifyYTiframeseektime('3443')">0:57:23</a> that's what he's at  
<a onclick="modifyYTiframeseektime('3444')">0:57:24</a> I am sending him something where I'm at  
<a onclick="modifyYTiframeseektime('3446')">0:57:26</a> I could probably watch that two-hour  
<a onclick="modifyYTiframeseektime('3447')">0:57:27</a> video and I'd enjoy it but he's not  
<a onclick="modifyYTiframeseektime('3449')">0:57:29</a> there so the idea of creating a platform  
<a onclick="modifyYTiframeseektime('3451')">0:57:31</a> of bite-sized education and also  
<a onclick="modifyYTiframeseektime('3455')">0:57:35</a> creating a foundation  
<a onclick="modifyYTiframeseektime('3456')">0:57:36</a> so what I talked about if you don't have  
<a onclick="modifyYTiframeseektime('3458')">0:57:38</a> your foundations to this foundation so  
<a onclick="modifyYTiframeseektime('3459')">0:57:39</a> in Rome about this year as everything  
<a onclick="modifyYTiframeseektime('3461')">0:57:41</a> went offline I try to just create a  
<a onclick="modifyYTiframeseektime('3464')">0:57:44</a> small online course for my local  
<a onclick="modifyYTiframeseektime('3465')">0:57:45</a> university police time to site and I  
<a onclick="modifyYTiframeseektime('3467')">0:57:47</a> call it for an 20 20 20 sewers in copy  
<a onclick="modifyYTiframeseektime('3470')">0:57:50</a> days it's at the moment website is in  
<a onclick="modifyYTiframeseektime('3475')">0:57:55</a> development but it's called in Charlotte  
<a onclick="modifyYTiframeseektime('3477')">0:57:57</a> will be called roots Academy code at UK  
<a onclick="modifyYTiframeseektime('3480')">0:58:00</a> something else that you did the 2020  
<a onclick="modifyYTiframeseektime('3483')">0:58:03</a> yeah when I'm 2020 it had a if you want  
<a onclick="modifyYTiframeseektime('3486')">0:58:06</a> to visit the course you can visit bitly  
<a onclick="modifyYTiframeseektime('3489')">0:58:09</a> or slash around 2020 means the IT dot ly  
<a onclick="modifyYTiframeseektime('3493')">0:58:13</a> post around 2020  
<a onclick="modifyYTiframeseektime('3495')">0:58:15</a> so 20 minutes a day for 20 days you  
<a onclick="modifyYTiframeseektime('3497')">0:58:17</a> learned the meanings of 20 students and  
<a onclick="modifyYTiframeseektime('3499')">0:58:19</a> my goal is through God's words himself  
<a onclick="modifyYTiframeseektime('3502')">0:58:22</a> learn the nature of cookies well who  
<a onclick="modifyYTiframeseektime('3504')">0:58:24</a> Allah who teaches goddess for example  
<a onclick="modifyYTiframeseektime('3506')">0:58:26</a> but with the direct relationship with  
<a onclick="modifyYTiframeseektime('3508')">0:58:28</a> the Quran and I just made it for my  
<a onclick="modifyYTiframeseektime('3512')">0:58:32</a> local Islamic society and then I just  
<a onclick="modifyYTiframeseektime('3514')">0:58:34</a> posted on my timeline and the next thing  
<a onclick="modifyYTiframeseektime('3515')">0:58:35</a> I know 3500 people signed up  
<a onclick="modifyYTiframeseektime('3518')">0:58:38</a> well I realized it there's a demand  
<a onclick="modifyYTiframeseektime('3520')">0:58:40</a> there's a new information give me the  
<a onclick="modifyYTiframeseektime('3522')">0:58:42</a> big dolly /did work around 2020 did it  
<a onclick="modifyYTiframeseektime('3528')">0:58:48</a> work  
<a onclick="modifyYTiframeseektime('3529')">0:58:49</a> no you went to 25 20 24 on ok nothing's  
<a onclick="modifyYTiframeseektime('3536')">0:58:56</a> when you're not set up ah there we go  
<a onclick="modifyYTiframeseektime('3540')">0:59:00</a> yeah it does least 2020 the idea is that  
<a onclick="modifyYTiframeseektime('3548')">0:59:08</a> you start a bit a structured course 20  
<a onclick="modifyYTiframeseektime('3550')">0:59:10</a> videos you can you have multiple choice  
<a onclick="modifyYTiframeseektime('3554')">0:59:14</a> questions geography education Quran 2020  
<a onclick="modifyYTiframeseektime('3557')">0:59:17</a> build a foundation studying the crimes  
<a onclick="modifyYTiframeseektime('3559')">0:59:19</a> meanings and role for free well  
<a onclick="modifyYTiframeseektime('3562')">0:59:22</a> researched  
<a onclick="modifyYTiframeseektime('3563')">0:59:23</a> testimonials and you're gonna have your  
<a onclick="modifyYTiframeseektime('3566')">0:59:26</a> other stuff on here right yet the idea  
<a onclick="modifyYTiframeseektime('3569')">0:59:29</a> is to build six courses that teach one  
<a onclick="modifyYTiframeseektime('3572')">0:59:32</a> subject most unknown subject 15 minutes  
<a onclick="modifyYTiframeseektime('3574')">0:59:34</a> a day in 20 days so the c-loc the life  
<a onclick="modifyYTiframeseektime('3577')">0:59:37</a> of the Prophet PC by 50 mates a day in  
<a onclick="modifyYTiframeseektime('3579')">0:59:39</a> 20 days each course will come with a  
<a onclick="modifyYTiframeseektime('3581')">0:59:41</a> designed workbook you can work through  
<a onclick="modifyYTiframeseektime('3583')">0:59:43</a> in your own time  
<a onclick="modifyYTiframeseektime('3583')">0:59:43</a> each video has quick multiple-choice  
<a onclick="modifyYTiframeseektime('3586')">0:59:46</a> questions reflection prompt you can  
<a onclick="modifyYTiframeseektime('3588')">0:59:48</a> write your answer  
<a onclick="modifyYTiframeseektime('3590')">0:59:50</a> you're saying good things about that  
<a onclick="modifyYTiframeseektime('3592')">0:59:52</a> says it all I'm the dealer possible you  
<a onclick="modifyYTiframeseektime('3594')">0:59:54</a> had a gunpoint  
<a onclick="modifyYTiframeseektime('3596')">0:59:56</a> so your stuffs gonna be on here just  
<a onclick="modifyYTiframeseektime('3600')">1:00:00</a> going to help build the foundations  
<a onclick="modifyYTiframeseektime('3602')">1:00:02</a> which is going to basically deal with  
<a onclick="modifyYTiframeseektime('3603')">1:00:03</a> the kind of maybe just stop sharing the  
<a onclick="modifyYTiframeseektime('3607')">1:00:07</a> screen because going  
<a onclick="modifyYTiframeseektime('3609')">1:00:09</a> so that's brilliant so people can access  
<a onclick="modifyYTiframeseektime('3611')">1:00:11</a> that you said how many students  
<a onclick="modifyYTiframeseektime('3613')">1:00:13</a> registered 3,000 you said about yeah  
<a onclick="modifyYTiframeseektime('3615')">1:00:15</a> about 2500 students from about 30  
<a onclick="modifyYTiframeseektime('3617')">1:00:17</a> countries no money thing just wanna [ __ ]  
<a onclick="modifyYTiframeseektime('3620')">1:00:20</a> me what that means this is phenomenal  
<a onclick="modifyYTiframeseektime('3623')">1:00:23</a> I have never let money have 81  
<a onclick="modifyYTiframeseektime('3626')">1:00:26</a> registered my webinars that many and I'm  
<a onclick="modifyYTiframeseektime('3630')">1:00:30</a> supposed to have like thousands of  
<a onclick="modifyYTiframeseektime('3632')">1:00:32</a> people follow and what does this mean  
<a onclick="modifyYTiframeseektime('3634')">1:00:34</a> this means a few things if number one  
<a onclick="modifyYTiframeseektime('3637')">1:00:37</a> market oh my mom  
<a onclick="modifyYTiframeseektime('3638')">1:00:38</a> yeah going no it means number one there  
<a onclick="modifyYTiframeseektime('3641')">1:00:41</a> is a neat number two sometimes maybe the  
<a onclick="modifyYTiframeseektime('3644')">1:00:44</a> way we communicate is too high level we  
<a onclick="modifyYTiframeseektime('3646')">1:00:46</a> need someone to break things down  
<a onclick="modifyYTiframeseektime('3647')">1:00:47</a> further also what it means is that there  
<a onclick="modifyYTiframeseektime('3653')">1:00:53</a> is many people need a resource to deal  
<a onclick="modifyYTiframeseektime('3657')">1:00:57</a> with these questions and it also means  
<a onclick="modifyYTiframeseektime('3658')">1:00:58</a> that YouTube is not doing it now we need  
<a onclick="modifyYTiframeseektime('3662')">1:01:02</a> to empower and we need to basically  
<a onclick="modifyYTiframeseektime('3664')">1:01:04</a> create material I know many other people  
<a onclick="modifyYTiframeseektime('3668')">1:01:08</a> are doing it many Institute's they're  
<a onclick="modifyYTiframeseektime('3670')">1:01:10</a> doing great work but that that  
<a onclick="modifyYTiframeseektime('3672')">1:01:12</a> face-to-face empowering that is so  
<a onclick="modifyYTiframeseektime('3675')">1:01:15</a> important and that's how you create  
<a onclick="modifyYTiframeseektime('3677')">1:01:17</a> future needed and that's how you create  
<a onclick="modifyYTiframeseektime('3679')">1:01:19</a> people who have those from foundations  
<a onclick="modifyYTiframeseektime('3681')">1:01:21</a> because reading an article watching a  
<a onclick="modifyYTiframeseektime('3683')">1:01:23</a> video is just not enough you have to go  
<a onclick="modifyYTiframeseektime('3685')">1:01:25</a> through a process and this for me is is  
<a onclick="modifyYTiframeseektime('3688')">1:01:28</a> like the cinema of you know the Islamic  
<a onclick="modifyYTiframeseektime('3691')">1:01:31</a> tradition if you like he's the Sunna of  
<a onclick="modifyYTiframeseektime('3693')">1:01:33</a> Allah that you sit with someone and  
<a onclick="modifyYTiframeseektime('3695')">1:01:35</a> there's I always say to people one line  
<a onclick="modifyYTiframeseektime('3698')">1:01:38</a> you're gonna learn from someone that you  
<a onclick="modifyYTiframeseektime('3701')">1:01:41</a> can't learn from a piece of writing or  
<a onclick="modifyYTiframeseektime('3704')">1:01:44</a> just by listening to a video when you go  
<a onclick="modifyYTiframeseektime('3707')">1:01:47</a> through that process with someone
