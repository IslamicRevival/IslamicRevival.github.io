Hijab argues that if a scientific theory contradicts the Quran, it can be overturned in a few years.

* **[00:35:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aliu6yertgo&t=2100)** Mohammed Hijab and Subboor Ahmed discuss the difference between history and science.

* **[00:50:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aliu6yertgo&t=3000)** Sapience Live moderator Mohammed Hijab and guest Subboor Ahmed discuss the concept of skepticism and its various applications. Ahmed argues that the arguments for moral skepticism are the strongest in philosophy, but are rejected by most philosophers.

Mohammed Hijab and Subboor Ahmed discuss the different schools of thought on divine command theory. Hijab explains that Islam does not have one singular answer, and the two discuss pantheism. They conclude that pantheism makes no sense because if god is divided into pieces, this would entail that he is generated.

**[01:00:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aliu6yertgo&t=3600)** Mohammed Hijab and Subboor Ahmed discuss the different schools of thought on divine command theory, with Mohammed Hijab explaining that Islam does not have one singular answer.

According to the two, polytheism makes no sense because if god is everywhere, he in he in every single aspect of creation, including parts. If god is divided into pieces, this would entail that he is generated, and the evidence of this is found in the Quran, where it mentions that god created in any form he wanted.

He says that he was a traditional English pagan and that he lost interest in idols after praying to the supreme god. He then became a firm believer that there is only one god. He also mentions that when it comes to religion, it is hard to get people to abandon polytheism. Hijab says that in terms of rationally, there are two arguments that completely defeat polytheism. One of these is trinitarianism, and the other is the fact that all religions rely on pantheistic notions.
* **[01:15:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aliu6yertgo&t=4500)** Mohammed Hijab and Subboor Ahmed discuss the different schools of thought on the existence of evil and the philosopher's approach to the problem. Yusuf mentions a book that discusses theodicy in greater detail.
* **[01:20:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aliu6yertgo&t=4800)** <>
* **[01:25:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aliu6yertgo&t=5100)** Mohammed Hijab and Subboor Ahmed discuss the differences between the pronunciation of the letter "kaf" and "kolkafi" and the importance of studying the Quran correctly.
* **[01:30:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aliu6yertgo&t=5400)** Mohammed Hijab and Subboor Ahmed discuss the differences between tajweed and path.

There are two opinions on the matter, with the Hamburger school of thought believing that the prayer is invalidated, and the Nux school of thought believing that the woman's distraction is simply a deficiency in the reward she would receive.

They also mention Betty Friedan's book, "The Feminine Mystique," in which Friedan discusses women's dissatisfaction with their roles in society.
* **[01:55:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aliu6yertgo&t=6900)** In this Q&A, Mohammed Hijab and Subboor Ahmed discuss the morality of marriage, and Ahmed asks Hijab if attributes of Allah can be limited to the presence of the creation. Hijab responds that it is irrelevant because if you put someone in a desert island, Allah does not need to exercise any action to have it, which is a logical quantity to think. The Christians will come and say that's why the trinity makes sense because love needed to be manifested to someone in order to create the bodies of the Trinity.
### [02:00:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aliu6yertgo&t=7200) - [02:10:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aliu6yertgo&t=7800)

Mohammed Hijab and Subboor Ahmed discuss the absurdity of the infinite regress, and how it applies to the problem of infinity. They argue that the regress is dependent on something else for its existence, and if it is dependent on itself, it is absurd. Ivy Sone points out that if all of the things in the infinite regress are contingent, then the regress cannot be infinite.

**[02:00:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aliu6yertgo&t=7200)* Discusses the absurdity of the infinite regress, which is the idea that there is an infinite chain of causes and effects between any two points in time. Atheists and theists alike agree that this is absurd, and thus the regress is not something which is necessarily absurd.
* **[02:05:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aliu6yertgo&t=7500)* Discusses the problem of infinity, and how it applies to the idea of an eternal regress. Mohammed Hijab and Subboor Ahmed discuss the different positions on the issue, and argue that the regress is dependent on something else for its existence. If it is dependent on itself, it is absurd; if it is dependent on something else, it must be independent. Ivy Sone points out that if all of the things in the infinite regress are contingent, then the regress cannot be infinite.
* **[02:10:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aliu6yertgo&t=7800)** Mohammed Hijab and Subboor Ahmed discuss the difference between an infinite regression of causes and of things, and how causality is ultimately absurd. They also mention how, if something brings rise to another thing which brings rise to another thing, existence would not even exist.

[0:02:09](https://youtu.be/aliu6yertgo?t=129) questioner brother  
[0:02:12](https://youtu.be/aliu6yertgo?t=132) salman assalamu alaikum

[0:02:20](https://youtu.be/aliu6yertgo?t=140) brother  
[0:02:32](https://youtu.be/aliu6yertgo?t=152) [Music]  
[0:02:35](https://youtu.be/aliu6yertgo?t=155) sure uh there's some atheists  
[0:02:39](https://youtu.be/aliu6yertgo?t=159) like they and maybe that they're gonna  
[0:02:42](https://youtu.be/aliu6yertgo?t=162) say  
[0:02:42](https://youtu.be/aliu6yertgo?t=162) okay he didn't write the quran  
[0:02:47](https://youtu.be/aliu6yertgo?t=167) okay the moon was split to uh  
[0:02:50](https://youtu.be/aliu6yertgo?t=170) the moon split okay but but that does  
[0:02:53](https://youtu.be/aliu6yertgo?t=173) not mean that he's a prophet  
[0:02:55](https://youtu.be/aliu6yertgo?t=175) uh he just said that god help him or he  
[0:02:59](https://youtu.be/aliu6yertgo?t=179) did it  
[0:02:59](https://youtu.be/aliu6yertgo?t=179) does not mean that he's prophet or or  
[0:03:02](https://youtu.be/aliu6yertgo?t=182) the quran  
[0:03:12](https://youtu.be/aliu6yertgo?t=192) that has been split so how this is  
[0:03:15](https://youtu.be/aliu6yertgo?t=195) does not mean that muhammad he split it  
[0:03:20](https://youtu.be/aliu6yertgo?t=200) so how like how can we say that you know  
[0:03:23](https://youtu.be/aliu6yertgo?t=203) it's muhammad  
[0:03:24](https://youtu.be/aliu6yertgo?t=204) peace be upon him he is the one that he  
[0:03:27](https://youtu.be/aliu6yertgo?t=207) did the split  
[0:03:29](https://youtu.be/aliu6yertgo?t=209) okay i mean we have to i think the way  
[0:03:32](https://youtu.be/aliu6yertgo?t=212) that this question is being asked  
[0:03:34](https://youtu.be/aliu6yertgo?t=214) uh by the atheist or whoever it is that  
[0:03:36](https://youtu.be/aliu6yertgo?t=216) is asking this question is  
[0:03:38](https://youtu.be/aliu6yertgo?t=218) quite a muddled way of uh questioning  
[0:03:41](https://youtu.be/aliu6yertgo?t=221) the first thing is why do we believe  
[0:03:44](https://youtu.be/aliu6yertgo?t=224) that the prophet peace be upon him is a  
[0:03:46](https://youtu.be/aliu6yertgo?t=226) true messenger of allah  
[0:03:47](https://youtu.be/aliu6yertgo?t=227) it's actually a whole bunch of reasons  
[0:03:50](https://youtu.be/aliu6yertgo?t=230) that together come together  
[0:03:52](https://youtu.be/aliu6yertgo?t=232) for a case which is robust so  
[0:03:55](https://youtu.be/aliu6yertgo?t=235) we talk about obviously the miraculous  
[0:03:57](https://youtu.be/aliu6yertgo?t=237) nature of the quran  
[0:03:58](https://youtu.be/aliu6yertgo?t=238) the sociological impact of the quran the  
[0:04:01](https://youtu.be/aliu6yertgo?t=241) message itself  
[0:04:02](https://youtu.be/aliu6yertgo?t=242) the predictions in the quran the  
[0:04:04](https://youtu.be/aliu6yertgo?t=244) prophecies of the prophet peace be upon  
[0:04:06](https://youtu.be/aliu6yertgo?t=246) him preservation  
[0:04:07](https://youtu.be/aliu6yertgo?t=247) the historical facts which were  
[0:04:10](https://youtu.be/aliu6yertgo?t=250) you know there's no way that they could  
[0:04:12](https://youtu.be/aliu6yertgo?t=252) have been known at the time  
[0:04:14](https://youtu.be/aliu6yertgo?t=254) of the the life of the prophet peace be  
[0:04:17](https://youtu.be/aliu6yertgo?t=257) upon him  
[0:04:17](https://youtu.be/aliu6yertgo?t=257) so when you add all of these things  
[0:04:19](https://youtu.be/aliu6yertgo?t=259) together then we would say that he is a  
[0:04:22](https://youtu.be/aliu6yertgo?t=262) true messenger of allah so the moon  
[0:04:25](https://youtu.be/aliu6yertgo?t=265) split  
[0:04:27](https://youtu.be/aliu6yertgo?t=267) miracle we believe in it because it's  
[0:04:30](https://youtu.be/aliu6yertgo?t=270) mentioned in the quran and we have  
[0:04:31](https://youtu.be/aliu6yertgo?t=271) reasons independent reasons for  
[0:04:33](https://youtu.be/aliu6yertgo?t=273) believing that the quran is true  
[0:04:34](https://youtu.be/aliu6yertgo?t=274) so i think his sort of questioning  
[0:04:38](https://youtu.be/aliu6yertgo?t=278) um of why we believe he's a messenger  
[0:04:42](https://youtu.be/aliu6yertgo?t=282) i think you just need to lay out that  
[0:04:44](https://youtu.be/aliu6yertgo?t=284) foundation because i think he doesn't  
[0:04:46](https://youtu.be/aliu6yertgo?t=286) seem to understand why we believe he's a  
[0:04:47](https://youtu.be/aliu6yertgo?t=287) messenger of god  
[0:04:52](https://youtu.be/aliu6yertgo?t=292) and you know you can go on if you want  
[0:04:54](https://youtu.be/aliu6yertgo?t=294) to see a list of those reasons with some  
[0:04:56](https://youtu.be/aliu6yertgo?t=296) evidences  
[0:04:57](https://youtu.be/aliu6yertgo?t=297) uh you can go on k by h dot code uk  
[0:05:00](https://youtu.be/aliu6yertgo?t=300) and i've got an article there refer  
[0:05:03](https://youtu.be/aliu6yertgo?t=303) called truth evidences for the

[0:05:22](https://youtu.be/aliu6yertgo?t=322) like some of the reasons  
[0:05:23](https://youtu.be/aliu6yertgo?t=323) and i divide them into or refer to as  
[0:05:26](https://youtu.be/aliu6yertgo?t=326) necessary conditions and sufficient  
[0:05:28](https://youtu.be/aliu6yertgo?t=328) conditions  
[0:05:29](https://youtu.be/aliu6yertgo?t=329) necessary conditions that you'd expect  
[0:05:31](https://youtu.be/aliu6yertgo?t=331) of any present  
[0:05:33](https://youtu.be/aliu6yertgo?t=333) any um word of god seems like  
[0:05:36](https://youtu.be/aliu6yertgo?t=336) preservations and lack of inc  
[0:05:38](https://youtu.be/aliu6yertgo?t=338) contradiction inconsistencies and then  
[0:05:40](https://youtu.be/aliu6yertgo?t=340) you have sufficient conditions things  
[0:05:42](https://youtu.be/aliu6yertgo?t=342) which  
[0:05:43](https://youtu.be/aliu6yertgo?t=343) bolster the case things like what you've  
[0:05:44](https://youtu.be/aliu6yertgo?t=344) just mentioned prophecies things like  
[0:05:47](https://youtu.be/aliu6yertgo?t=347) um you know the lorawi the language  
[0:05:50](https://youtu.be/aliu6yertgo?t=350) miracles the structural miracles of the

[0:05:55](https://youtu.be/aliu6yertgo?t=355) himself his track record  
[0:05:57](https://youtu.be/aliu6yertgo?t=357) you know the physical miracles of which  
[0:05:59](https://youtu.be/aliu6yertgo?t=359) the moon splitting is just one thing  
[0:06:01](https://youtu.be/aliu6yertgo?t=361) there's so many other examples i don't  
[0:06:03](https://youtu.be/aliu6yertgo?t=363) you know and  
[0:06:04](https://youtu.be/aliu6yertgo?t=364) classically scholars have spoken and  
[0:06:05](https://youtu.be/aliu6yertgo?t=365) written huge books like the letter and  
[0:06:07](https://youtu.be/aliu6yertgo?t=367) the book  
[0:06:07](https://youtu.be/aliu6yertgo?t=367) huge book whose book huge books on this  
[0:06:10](https://youtu.be/aliu6yertgo?t=370) kind of thing so  
[0:06:11](https://youtu.be/aliu6yertgo?t=371) i try and condense it it's in like i  
[0:06:14](https://youtu.be/aliu6yertgo?t=374) don't know 10 pages or 12 pages  
[0:06:16](https://youtu.be/aliu6yertgo?t=376) and i and i mentioned 15 such evidences  
[0:06:18](https://youtu.be/aliu6yertgo?t=378) for the audience  
[0:06:19](https://youtu.be/aliu6yertgo?t=379) that's k by h uk you can download it for  
[0:06:22](https://youtu.be/aliu6yertgo?t=382) free  
[0:06:22](https://youtu.be/aliu6yertgo?t=382) hopefully that will set like you said a  
[0:06:24](https://youtu.be/aliu6yertgo?t=384) better foundation  
[0:06:26](https://youtu.be/aliu6yertgo?t=386) makes sense brother solomon yeah  
[0:06:29](https://youtu.be/aliu6yertgo?t=389) i know what you mean but like maybe like  
[0:06:32](https://youtu.be/aliu6yertgo?t=392) some  
[0:06:33](https://youtu.be/aliu6yertgo?t=393) atheists they're gonna say that muhammad  
[0:06:35](https://youtu.be/aliu6yertgo?t=395) was a special guy  
[0:06:37](https://youtu.be/aliu6yertgo?t=397) just a special guy but he wasn't like a  
[0:06:40](https://youtu.be/aliu6yertgo?t=400) prophet yeah  
[0:06:41](https://youtu.be/aliu6yertgo?t=401) his book is very special nobody can  
[0:06:44](https://youtu.be/aliu6yertgo?t=404) bring something like the quran but that  
[0:06:47](https://youtu.be/aliu6yertgo?t=407) doesn't mean that he is  
[0:06:49](https://youtu.be/aliu6yertgo?t=409) the prophet or the quran we don't know  
[0:06:52](https://youtu.be/aliu6yertgo?t=412) the quran from where it's not from  
[0:06:53](https://youtu.be/aliu6yertgo?t=413) muhammad  
[0:06:54](https://youtu.be/aliu6yertgo?t=414) but we don't know well don't focus too  
[0:06:58](https://youtu.be/aliu6yertgo?t=418) much on what the atheist  
[0:06:59](https://youtu.be/aliu6yertgo?t=419) says that's sometimes we we we  
[0:07:02](https://youtu.be/aliu6yertgo?t=422) we take responses of the atheists like  
[0:07:04](https://youtu.be/aliu6yertgo?t=424) very seriously  
[0:07:05](https://youtu.be/aliu6yertgo?t=425) the atheist can say whatever the hell he  
[0:07:07](https://youtu.be/aliu6yertgo?t=427) likes you know how do you respect  
[0:07:08](https://youtu.be/aliu6yertgo?t=428) him um you know he's gonna be in the  
[0:07:11](https://youtu.be/aliu6yertgo?t=431) when he's been given this evidence and  
[0:07:13](https://youtu.be/aliu6yertgo?t=433) he rejects it  
[0:07:14](https://youtu.be/aliu6yertgo?t=434) you know the quran states he's going to  
[0:07:16](https://youtu.be/aliu6yertgo?t=436) be in a position where  
[0:07:18](https://youtu.be/aliu6yertgo?t=438) you know it says  
[0:07:24](https://youtu.be/aliu6yertgo?t=444) you know you're going to be in the hell  
[0:07:26](https://youtu.be/aliu6yertgo?t=446) fire whether your patience or  
[0:07:28](https://youtu.be/aliu6yertgo?t=448) you're patient or not it doesn't matter  
[0:07:29](https://youtu.be/aliu6yertgo?t=449) you're going to be in a situation where  
[0:07:31](https://youtu.be/aliu6yertgo?t=451) all the talking that you have now  
[0:07:33](https://youtu.be/aliu6yertgo?t=453) is going to be nothing basically so talk  
[0:07:35](https://youtu.be/aliu6yertgo?t=455) say what you want you know at the end of  
[0:07:36](https://youtu.be/aliu6yertgo?t=456) the day  
[0:07:37](https://youtu.be/aliu6yertgo?t=457) you know uh we've given you the message  
[0:07:39](https://youtu.be/aliu6yertgo?t=459) the way we see it in islam is this  
[0:07:41](https://youtu.be/aliu6yertgo?t=461) you're born on the fitra  
[0:07:57](https://youtu.be/aliu6yertgo?t=477) them into whoever religion is now the  
[0:07:59](https://youtu.be/aliu6yertgo?t=479) prophets have not come to force anybody  
[0:08:01](https://youtu.be/aliu6yertgo?t=481) to become believers  
[0:08:03](https://youtu.be/aliu6yertgo?t=483) we're not here to force anyone to be  
[0:08:05](https://youtu.be/aliu6yertgo?t=485) believers lest that  
[0:08:06](https://youtu.be/aliu6yertgo?t=486) be muslim allah has told the prophet  
[0:08:09](https://youtu.be/aliu6yertgo?t=489) you're not  
[0:08:11](https://youtu.be/aliu6yertgo?t=491) you're not meant to compel these people  
[0:08:13](https://youtu.be/aliu6yertgo?t=493) into islam  
[0:08:14](https://youtu.be/aliu6yertgo?t=494) so all we're doing is we're reminding  
[0:08:16](https://youtu.be/aliu6yertgo?t=496) them of an instinct they should already  
[0:08:18](https://youtu.be/aliu6yertgo?t=498) have  
[0:08:19](https://youtu.be/aliu6yertgo?t=499) which is the instinct of to believe in  
[0:08:21](https://youtu.be/aliu6yertgo?t=501) one god and worship one god that's why  
[0:08:23](https://youtu.be/aliu6yertgo?t=503) i mentioned this recently but i was  
[0:08:25](https://youtu.be/aliu6yertgo?t=505) pondering over the ayah  
[0:08:26](https://youtu.be/aliu6yertgo?t=506) allah says  
[0:08:34](https://youtu.be/aliu6yertgo?t=514) if you're in any doubt about my religion  
[0:08:37](https://youtu.be/aliu6yertgo?t=517) i don't worship any of the gods that you  
[0:08:38](https://youtu.be/aliu6yertgo?t=518) worship aside from allah  
[0:08:40](https://youtu.be/aliu6yertgo?t=520) but i worship allah the one who takes  
[0:08:42](https://youtu.be/aliu6yertgo?t=522) that consciousness away  
[0:08:43](https://youtu.be/aliu6yertgo?t=523) now why does allah mention that because  
[0:08:45](https://youtu.be/aliu6yertgo?t=525) the number one proof of this  
[0:08:47](https://youtu.be/aliu6yertgo?t=527) the validity of islam is this  
[0:08:49](https://youtu.be/aliu6yertgo?t=529) puritanical and respectable monarchism  
[0:08:52](https://youtu.be/aliu6yertgo?t=532) [Music]  
[0:08:53](https://youtu.be/aliu6yertgo?t=533) it should hit a nerve hearing about  
[0:08:56](https://youtu.be/aliu6yertgo?t=536) talking of allah the creator of god if  
[0:08:58](https://youtu.be/aliu6yertgo?t=538) it doesn't  
[0:08:59](https://youtu.be/aliu6yertgo?t=539) then that means you're corrupt to a  
[0:09:00](https://youtu.be/aliu6yertgo?t=540) state of no to a point of no return  
[0:09:03](https://youtu.be/aliu6yertgo?t=543) and whatever punishment you get in the  
[0:09:04](https://youtu.be/aliu6yertgo?t=544) hell fire thereafter will be the  
[0:09:06](https://youtu.be/aliu6yertgo?t=546) the work of your own uh arrogance your  
[0:09:10](https://youtu.be/aliu6yertgo?t=550) your psychological arrogance that you  
[0:09:11](https://youtu.be/aliu6yertgo?t=551) had against something which should be  
[0:09:13](https://youtu.be/aliu6yertgo?t=553) instinctive to you so the ac what the  
[0:09:16](https://youtu.be/aliu6yertgo?t=556) atheist says  
[0:09:17](https://youtu.be/aliu6yertgo?t=557) i mean would you respect who cares what  
[0:09:18](https://youtu.be/aliu6yertgo?t=558) the atheist has to say we're here to  
[0:09:20](https://youtu.be/aliu6yertgo?t=560) present  
[0:09:21](https://youtu.be/aliu6yertgo?t=561) what we believe in if he wants to be an  
[0:09:22](https://youtu.be/aliu6yertgo?t=562) ultra skeptic in everything else  
[0:09:25](https://youtu.be/aliu6yertgo?t=565) everything uh religious everything  
[0:09:26](https://youtu.be/aliu6yertgo?t=566) rational but not his own life  
[0:09:28](https://youtu.be/aliu6yertgo?t=568) you know in inference making he's not  
[0:09:30](https://youtu.be/aliu6yertgo?t=570) like that in his own life  
[0:09:31](https://youtu.be/aliu6yertgo?t=571) he doesn't he's not ultra skeptic or  
[0:09:33](https://youtu.be/aliu6yertgo?t=573) anything he wants to be like we'll see  
[0:09:35](https://youtu.be/aliu6yertgo?t=575) on the day of judgment yeah i think it's  
[0:09:37](https://youtu.be/aliu6yertgo?t=577) a very good point that you raised about  
[0:09:40](https://youtu.be/aliu6yertgo?t=580) being selectively skeptical because  
[0:09:44](https://youtu.be/aliu6yertgo?t=584) for example in this case he's saying  
[0:09:45](https://youtu.be/aliu6yertgo?t=585) well if even if the moon split  
[0:09:48](https://youtu.be/aliu6yertgo?t=588) it means he's special and he's not the  
[0:09:50](https://youtu.be/aliu6yertgo?t=590) messenger and other atheists have said  
[0:09:52](https://youtu.be/aliu6yertgo?t=592) things like  
[0:09:53](https://youtu.be/aliu6yertgo?t=593) well it is possible that you know um  
[0:09:57](https://youtu.be/aliu6yertgo?t=597) this miracle happened or that miracle  
[0:09:59](https://youtu.be/aliu6yertgo?t=599) happened but that doesn't mean  
[0:10:00](https://youtu.be/aliu6yertgo?t=600) this it could be the devil it could be  
[0:10:02](https://youtu.be/aliu6yertgo?t=602) this it could be people give all these  
[0:10:03](https://youtu.be/aliu6yertgo?t=603) types of possibilities  
[0:10:05](https://youtu.be/aliu6yertgo?t=605) but the fact is in your everyday life  
[0:10:08](https://youtu.be/aliu6yertgo?t=608) nobody thinks like that exactly yeah and  
[0:10:10](https://youtu.be/aliu6yertgo?t=610) so what they're doing is they are  
[0:10:12](https://youtu.be/aliu6yertgo?t=612) dialing up  
[0:10:13](https://youtu.be/aliu6yertgo?t=613) the skepticism skepticism to a thousand  
[0:10:16](https://youtu.be/aliu6yertgo?t=616) percent when it comes to theology  
[0:10:18](https://youtu.be/aliu6yertgo?t=618) but when it comes to their everyday life  
[0:10:20](https://youtu.be/aliu6yertgo?t=620) they make it  
[0:10:22](https://youtu.be/aliu6yertgo?t=622) you know it's a reasonable reasonable  
[0:10:23](https://youtu.be/aliu6yertgo?t=623) standard 20 30 whatever it is  
[0:10:26](https://youtu.be/aliu6yertgo?t=626) and i also think there's something  
[0:10:27](https://youtu.be/aliu6yertgo?t=627) important  
[0:10:29](https://youtu.be/aliu6yertgo?t=629) muslims think sometimes  
[0:10:32](https://youtu.be/aliu6yertgo?t=632) because of the way that we have a  
[0:10:36](https://youtu.be/aliu6yertgo?t=636) lack of understanding of the way that we  
[0:10:38](https://youtu.be/aliu6yertgo?t=638) should articulate islam  
[0:10:39](https://youtu.be/aliu6yertgo?t=639) that every assertion is an argument  
[0:10:43](https://youtu.be/aliu6yertgo?t=643) it's not an assertion is simply an  
[0:10:46](https://youtu.be/aliu6yertgo?t=646) assertion it's it's water off a duck's  
[0:10:47](https://youtu.be/aliu6yertgo?t=647) back so if someone says  
[0:10:49](https://youtu.be/aliu6yertgo?t=649) well even if the moon split doesn't mean  
[0:10:51](https://youtu.be/aliu6yertgo?t=651) he's a messenger yeah that's  
[0:10:53](https://youtu.be/aliu6yertgo?t=653) an assertion that's not actually an  
[0:10:55](https://youtu.be/aliu6yertgo?t=655) argument and i've often seen muslims  
[0:10:56](https://youtu.be/aliu6yertgo?t=656) falling into the trap of thinking  
[0:10:58](https://youtu.be/aliu6yertgo?t=658) an atheist said x therefore i need to  
[0:11:01](https://youtu.be/aliu6yertgo?t=661) respond to x no you don't  
[0:11:02](https://youtu.be/aliu6yertgo?t=662) if x is simply an assertion then what is  
[0:11:05](https://youtu.be/aliu6yertgo?t=665) asserted without evidence can be  
[0:11:07](https://youtu.be/aliu6yertgo?t=667) dismissed with our evidence  
[0:11:08](https://youtu.be/aliu6yertgo?t=668) you can simply just just whack it in  
[0:11:11](https://youtu.be/aliu6yertgo?t=671) that way  
[0:11:12](https://youtu.be/aliu6yertgo?t=672) so hopefully that makes sense brother  
[0:11:13](https://youtu.be/aliu6yertgo?t=673) salman  
[0:11:15](https://youtu.be/aliu6yertgo?t=675) thank you okay  
[0:11:19](https://youtu.be/aliu6yertgo?t=679) next we have brother commander  
[0:11:25](https://youtu.be/aliu6yertgo?t=685) something i can't sorry yeah i didn't  
[0:11:28](https://youtu.be/aliu6yertgo?t=688) really put much thought into that name  
[0:11:30](https://youtu.be/aliu6yertgo?t=690) um hosting this yeah  
[0:11:33](https://youtu.be/aliu6yertgo?t=693) i don't know i was just i don't know but  
[0:11:36](https://youtu.be/aliu6yertgo?t=696) uh thank you for hosting this live  
[0:11:37](https://youtu.be/aliu6yertgo?t=697) stream um i actually wanted to ask you  
[0:11:39](https://youtu.be/aliu6yertgo?t=699) that  
[0:11:40](https://youtu.be/aliu6yertgo?t=700) for these past two months i've actually  
[0:11:42](https://youtu.be/aliu6yertgo?t=702) been going on this like uh  
[0:11:44](https://youtu.be/aliu6yertgo?t=704) almost intellectual crusade with this  
[0:11:46](https://youtu.be/aliu6yertgo?t=706) one christian we've been arguing back  
[0:11:48](https://youtu.be/aliu6yertgo?t=708) and forth about which religion is true  
[0:11:50](https://youtu.be/aliu6yertgo?t=710) um and and of course i've hit him with  
[0:11:52](https://youtu.be/aliu6yertgo?t=712) all the prophecies that  
[0:11:53](https://youtu.be/aliu6yertgo?t=713) uh were fulfilled and that came true in  
[0:11:55](https://youtu.be/aliu6yertgo?t=715) the modern era  
[0:11:56](https://youtu.be/aliu6yertgo?t=716) um and of course you know he hits me  
[0:11:58](https://youtu.be/aliu6yertgo?t=718) back with like these are vague or he'll  
[0:12:00](https://youtu.be/aliu6yertgo?t=720) misappropriate the dates or whatnot  
[0:12:02](https://youtu.be/aliu6yertgo?t=722) um but i don't mean to go unattentioned  
[0:12:04](https://youtu.be/aliu6yertgo?t=724) uh of all the things he's addressed the  
[0:12:06](https://youtu.be/aliu6yertgo?t=726) misconceptions about islam  
[0:12:08](https://youtu.be/aliu6yertgo?t=728) that i was able to research most of them  
[0:12:09](https://youtu.be/aliu6yertgo?t=729) and debunk them all there was one thing  
[0:12:11](https://youtu.be/aliu6yertgo?t=731) that he brought up  
[0:12:12](https://youtu.be/aliu6yertgo?t=732) that kind of stumped me and i couldn't  
[0:12:14](https://youtu.be/aliu6yertgo?t=734) really find an answer are you familiar  
[0:12:16](https://youtu.be/aliu6yertgo?t=736) with the um  
[0:12:17](https://youtu.be/aliu6yertgo?t=737) inheritance distribution verse in the  
[0:12:19](https://youtu.be/aliu6yertgo?t=739) quran i can't remember which verses it  
[0:12:20](https://youtu.be/aliu6yertgo?t=740) was  
[0:12:21](https://youtu.be/aliu6yertgo?t=741) but basically right basically he tallied  
[0:12:24](https://youtu.be/aliu6yertgo?t=744) it up  
[0:12:24](https://youtu.be/aliu6yertgo?t=744) and he was like oh it goes over one  
[0:12:26](https://youtu.be/aliu6yertgo?t=746) percent and i found some uh  
[0:12:28](https://youtu.be/aliu6yertgo?t=748) reasoning as to why it goes over one  
[0:12:29](https://youtu.be/aliu6yertgo?t=749) percent but just really briefly could  
[0:12:31](https://youtu.be/aliu6yertgo?t=751) you explain that verse  
[0:12:34](https://youtu.be/aliu6yertgo?t=754) yeah well this area in the foreign  
[0:12:36](https://youtu.be/aliu6yertgo?t=756) doesn't go over one percent uh sorry  
[0:12:38](https://youtu.be/aliu6yertgo?t=758) hundred percent  
[0:12:39](https://youtu.be/aliu6yertgo?t=759) one that's right it's only in if if you  
[0:12:43](https://youtu.be/aliu6yertgo?t=763) if you put certain people  
[0:12:46](https://youtu.be/aliu6yertgo?t=766) in the equation it can go over one  
[0:12:49](https://youtu.be/aliu6yertgo?t=769) now the point is there's nothing wrong  
[0:12:52](https://youtu.be/aliu6yertgo?t=772) with  
[0:12:53](https://youtu.be/aliu6yertgo?t=773) things that go over one it's a hundred  
[0:12:56](https://youtu.be/aliu6yertgo?t=776) and ten percent  
[0:12:57](https://youtu.be/aliu6yertgo?t=777) is as valid as true a number is a  
[0:12:59](https://youtu.be/aliu6yertgo?t=779) hundred percent  
[0:13:00](https://youtu.be/aliu6yertgo?t=780) it's why is there an assumption that it  
[0:13:02](https://youtu.be/aliu6yertgo?t=782) has to be one hundred percent  
[0:13:04](https://youtu.be/aliu6yertgo?t=784) why can't it be 150 and then we can  
[0:13:06](https://youtu.be/aliu6yertgo?t=786) split it from 150.  
[0:13:08](https://youtu.be/aliu6yertgo?t=788) and this is known as  
[0:13:14](https://youtu.be/aliu6yertgo?t=794) because at the time of um the  
[0:13:17](https://youtu.be/aliu6yertgo?t=797) you know they asked him this question if  
[0:13:18](https://youtu.be/aliu6yertgo?t=798) we if we have this person and that  
[0:13:20](https://youtu.be/aliu6yertgo?t=800) person two  
[0:13:21](https://youtu.be/aliu6yertgo?t=801) a wife and two kids or two three  
[0:13:23](https://youtu.be/aliu6yertgo?t=803) daughters and  
[0:13:24](https://youtu.be/aliu6yertgo?t=804) like these particular cases yeah it goes  
[0:13:27](https://youtu.be/aliu6yertgo?t=807) over one  
[0:13:28](https://youtu.be/aliu6yertgo?t=808) so what do we do all we do is we  
[0:13:30](https://youtu.be/aliu6yertgo?t=810) distribute it in the same ratio  
[0:13:33](https://youtu.be/aliu6yertgo?t=813) as we would do if it had been one that's  
[0:13:36](https://youtu.be/aliu6yertgo?t=816) what we do simple as that really and  
[0:13:37](https://youtu.be/aliu6yertgo?t=817) this  
[0:13:39](https://youtu.be/aliu6yertgo?t=819) dealt with that and so the alibni and it  
[0:13:42](https://youtu.be/aliu6yertgo?t=822) was referred to as  
[0:13:44](https://youtu.be/aliu6yertgo?t=824) but remember because he said it when he  
[0:13:47](https://youtu.be/aliu6yertgo?t=827) was on the mimba  
[0:13:48](https://youtu.be/aliu6yertgo?t=828) he they asked him the question when he  
[0:13:50](https://youtu.be/aliu6yertgo?t=830) was in the pulpit and he answered it  
[0:13:51](https://youtu.be/aliu6yertgo?t=831) when he was on the pulpit  
[0:13:53](https://youtu.be/aliu6yertgo?t=833) because after um so these things are  
[0:13:56](https://youtu.be/aliu6yertgo?t=836) very well known in the shariah  
[0:13:58](https://youtu.be/aliu6yertgo?t=838) the fact that you have an inheritance  
[0:14:00](https://youtu.be/aliu6yertgo?t=840) that goes over 100 percent there is no  
[0:14:02](https://youtu.be/aliu6yertgo?t=842) mathematical problem with that otherwise  
[0:14:03](https://youtu.be/aliu6yertgo?t=843) if this was an invalid way of  
[0:14:05](https://youtu.be/aliu6yertgo?t=845) mathematical expression improper  
[0:14:06](https://youtu.be/aliu6yertgo?t=846) fractions would be an invalid way of  
[0:14:08](https://youtu.be/aliu6yertgo?t=848) mathematical expression  
[0:14:10](https://youtu.be/aliu6yertgo?t=850) improper fractions where the denominator  
[0:14:12](https://youtu.be/aliu6yertgo?t=852) is bigger than the  
[0:14:13](https://youtu.be/aliu6yertgo?t=853) the numerators bigger than the  
[0:14:14](https://youtu.be/aliu6yertgo?t=854) denominator is a thing  
[0:14:16](https://youtu.be/aliu6yertgo?t=856) it just it can be expressed as what it's  
[0:14:19](https://youtu.be/aliu6yertgo?t=859) like  
[0:14:19](https://youtu.be/aliu6yertgo?t=859) one and then whatever it is the fraction  
[0:14:22](https://youtu.be/aliu6yertgo?t=862) is or it can be expressed as an improper  
[0:14:24](https://youtu.be/aliu6yertgo?t=864) fraction both  
[0:14:24](https://youtu.be/aliu6yertgo?t=864) of those expressions are mathematically  
[0:14:27](https://youtu.be/aliu6yertgo?t=867) fine  
[0:14:28](https://youtu.be/aliu6yertgo?t=868) it is no tanaka there's no um  
[0:14:31](https://youtu.be/aliu6yertgo?t=871) inconsistency there you see the point so  
[0:14:34](https://youtu.be/aliu6yertgo?t=874) right  
[0:14:35](https://youtu.be/aliu6yertgo?t=875) yeah so the assumption that it cannot go  
[0:14:38](https://youtu.be/aliu6yertgo?t=878) over 100  
[0:14:39](https://youtu.be/aliu6yertgo?t=879) is it has to be justified somehow the  
[0:14:41](https://youtu.be/aliu6yertgo?t=881) prophet muhammad said he said okay well  
[0:14:42](https://youtu.be/aliu6yertgo?t=882) you  
[0:14:57](https://youtu.be/aliu6yertgo?t=897) your mother pete and alibaba  
[0:15:00](https://youtu.be/aliu6yertgo?t=900) and they knew the sunnah and they are  
[0:15:02](https://youtu.be/aliu6yertgo?t=902) part of that what the prophet muhammed  
[0:15:04](https://youtu.be/aliu6yertgo?t=904) said so what they said in terms of  
[0:15:06](https://youtu.be/aliu6yertgo?t=906) the krishna or the division of something  
[0:15:08](https://youtu.be/aliu6yertgo?t=908) which goes over 100  
[0:15:10](https://youtu.be/aliu6yertgo?t=910) which is to ratio it as if it was 100  
[0:15:13](https://youtu.be/aliu6yertgo?t=913) and to do with it accordingly  
[0:15:14](https://youtu.be/aliu6yertgo?t=914) and there's other steps like i'm going  
[0:15:16](https://youtu.be/aliu6yertgo?t=916) to go into deep uh  
[0:15:17](https://youtu.be/aliu6yertgo?t=917) the steps what you'd have to do here  
[0:15:19](https://youtu.be/aliu6yertgo?t=919) right now  
[0:15:21](https://youtu.be/aliu6yertgo?t=921) uh you know that is a way that we we  
[0:15:23](https://youtu.be/aliu6yertgo?t=923) deal with it  
[0:15:24](https://youtu.be/aliu6yertgo?t=924) the the the assumption that it has to be  
[0:15:26](https://youtu.be/aliu6yertgo?t=926) 100 or  
[0:15:27](https://youtu.be/aliu6yertgo?t=927) one like one the number one a whole  
[0:15:30](https://youtu.be/aliu6yertgo?t=930) is an unjustifiable assumption because  
[0:15:32](https://youtu.be/aliu6yertgo?t=932) 110 is as  
[0:15:34](https://youtu.be/aliu6yertgo?t=934) valid a percentage as a hundred percent  
[0:15:38](https://youtu.be/aliu6yertgo?t=938) you can is is a thing it's not like  
[0:15:40](https://youtu.be/aliu6yertgo?t=940) people are so dumb that they don't  
[0:15:41](https://youtu.be/aliu6yertgo?t=941) realize that  
[0:15:42](https://youtu.be/aliu6yertgo?t=942) 150 percent is oh 150 or 100 like  
[0:15:45](https://youtu.be/aliu6yertgo?t=945) they think it pops 100 no you can't have  
[0:15:47](https://youtu.be/aliu6yertgo?t=947) expression 150 is not a false  
[0:15:50](https://youtu.be/aliu6yertgo?t=950) expression do you see the brain like  
[0:15:54](https://youtu.be/aliu6yertgo?t=954) if i say one and one third what am i  
[0:15:57](https://youtu.be/aliu6yertgo?t=957) saying 133  
[0:16:00](https://youtu.be/aliu6yertgo?t=960) that's what i'm saying 133.3 percent  
[0:16:03](https://youtu.be/aliu6yertgo?t=963) uh are people that illiterate  
[0:16:05](https://youtu.be/aliu6yertgo?t=965) mathematically that they don't  
[0:16:06](https://youtu.be/aliu6yertgo?t=966) understand that these are very  
[0:16:07](https://youtu.be/aliu6yertgo?t=967) legitimate  
[0:16:08](https://youtu.be/aliu6yertgo?t=968) i'm not saying you but right right  
[0:16:10](https://youtu.be/aliu6yertgo?t=970) they're assuming that it has to  
[0:16:12](https://youtu.be/aliu6yertgo?t=972) be within one why there's no  
[0:16:13](https://youtu.be/aliu6yertgo?t=973) justification for that it's so stupid  
[0:16:15](https://youtu.be/aliu6yertgo?t=975) right yeah well if we were to apply this  
[0:16:18](https://youtu.be/aliu6yertgo?t=978) kind of  
[0:16:19](https://youtu.be/aliu6yertgo?t=979) thinking to profits right your business  
[0:16:21](https://youtu.be/aliu6yertgo?t=981) would never grow beyond 100 percent  
[0:16:24](https://youtu.be/aliu6yertgo?t=984) oh oh no no so we can't declare we can't  
[0:16:26](https://youtu.be/aliu6yertgo?t=986) make more profit than this because this  
[0:16:27](https://youtu.be/aliu6yertgo?t=987) is going into mathematical irregularity  
[0:16:29](https://youtu.be/aliu6yertgo?t=989) not impossibility  
[0:16:29](https://youtu.be/aliu6yertgo?t=989) you're making it seem like going over  
[0:16:31](https://youtu.be/aliu6yertgo?t=991) 100 is my favorite belief  
[0:16:34](https://youtu.be/aliu6yertgo?t=994) right i think yeah then you'd have to  
[0:16:37](https://youtu.be/aliu6yertgo?t=997) you have to ask the guy why is going  
[0:16:39](https://youtu.be/aliu6yertgo?t=999) over 100 a mathematical impossibility  
[0:16:41](https://youtu.be/aliu6yertgo?t=1001) that's like that is low iq thinking i'm  
[0:16:43](https://youtu.be/aliu6yertgo?t=1003) really so i'm not mathematician but i  
[0:16:45](https://youtu.be/aliu6yertgo?t=1005) know that  
[0:16:45](https://youtu.be/aliu6yertgo?t=1005) there is such a thing as 110 there's  
[0:16:47](https://youtu.be/aliu6yertgo?t=1007) such a thing as a thousand percent you  
[0:16:50](https://youtu.be/aliu6yertgo?t=1010) know it's just it's just an expression  
[0:16:52](https://youtu.be/aliu6yertgo?t=1012) of a hundred percent time sin i mean  
[0:16:55](https://youtu.be/aliu6yertgo?t=1015) these people  
[0:16:56](https://youtu.be/aliu6yertgo?t=1016) they have nothing to attack the quran  
[0:16:58](https://youtu.be/aliu6yertgo?t=1018) they have nothing  
[0:16:59](https://youtu.be/aliu6yertgo?t=1019) this shows you the shambolic state of  
[0:17:01](https://youtu.be/aliu6yertgo?t=1021) attacking the quran  
[0:17:02](https://youtu.be/aliu6yertgo?t=1022) right exactly i completely agree with  
[0:17:04](https://youtu.be/aliu6yertgo?t=1024) you and also can i ask just one last  
[0:17:06](https://youtu.be/aliu6yertgo?t=1026) one burning question that i've had on my  
[0:17:07](https://youtu.be/aliu6yertgo?t=1027) mind for such a long time  
[0:17:09](https://youtu.be/aliu6yertgo?t=1029) um sorry could we have one question per  
[0:17:12](https://youtu.be/aliu6yertgo?t=1032) person  
[0:17:13](https://youtu.be/aliu6yertgo?t=1033) cause it's burning come on  
[0:17:18](https://youtu.be/aliu6yertgo?t=1038) i'll try to make this very short in my  
[0:17:20](https://youtu.be/aliu6yertgo?t=1040) brief um compare like  
[0:17:22](https://youtu.be/aliu6yertgo?t=1042) after two months of fighting with this  
[0:17:24](https://youtu.be/aliu6yertgo?t=1044) guy uh i finally summed it down to  
[0:17:26](https://youtu.be/aliu6yertgo?t=1046) um i told him like referred the history  
[0:17:29](https://youtu.be/aliu6yertgo?t=1049) of how the bible was formed by paul  
[0:17:31](https://youtu.be/aliu6yertgo?t=1051) which was about two decades  
[0:17:32](https://youtu.be/aliu6yertgo?t=1052) after the ascension of jesus and so my  
[0:17:35](https://youtu.be/aliu6yertgo?t=1055) conclusion was it was  
[0:17:36](https://youtu.be/aliu6yertgo?t=1056) it was a man made by uh by paul whose  
[0:17:40](https://youtu.be/aliu6yertgo?t=1060) only claim to authority was he  
[0:17:41](https://youtu.be/aliu6yertgo?t=1061) supposedly saw jesus in a vision now  
[0:17:44](https://youtu.be/aliu6yertgo?t=1064) having said that uh  
[0:17:45](https://youtu.be/aliu6yertgo?t=1065) um he attacks the preservation of the  
[0:17:47](https://youtu.be/aliu6yertgo?t=1067) quran narrative saying that it was  
[0:17:49](https://youtu.be/aliu6yertgo?t=1069) compiled  
[0:17:49](https://youtu.be/aliu6yertgo?t=1069) one year after the prophet's death so i  
[0:17:52](https://youtu.be/aliu6yertgo?t=1072) said uh  
[0:17:52](https://youtu.be/aliu6yertgo?t=1072) and in addition to that he said um  
[0:17:55](https://youtu.be/aliu6yertgo?t=1075) because of that  
[0:17:56](https://youtu.be/aliu6yertgo?t=1076) it's not worthy so i said comparatively  
[0:17:59](https://youtu.be/aliu6yertgo?t=1079) speaking  
[0:18:00](https://youtu.be/aliu6yertgo?t=1080) two decades is far more inauthentic  
[0:18:02](https://youtu.be/aliu6yertgo?t=1082) compared to and on top of that  
[0:18:03](https://youtu.be/aliu6yertgo?t=1083) um it was written not just compiled it  
[0:18:05](https://youtu.be/aliu6yertgo?t=1085) was written by paul whereas at the time  
[0:18:07](https://youtu.be/aliu6yertgo?t=1087) of the prophet's death  
[0:18:08](https://youtu.be/aliu6yertgo?t=1088) uh the quran was already written it was  
[0:18:10](https://youtu.be/aliu6yertgo?t=1090) simply compiled by uh his sahaba who had  
[0:18:12](https://youtu.be/aliu6yertgo?t=1092) already memorized it on top of the fact  
[0:18:14](https://youtu.be/aliu6yertgo?t=1094) so then he finally concluded that fine  
[0:18:16](https://youtu.be/aliu6yertgo?t=1096) in that case since the hadiths were 250  
[0:18:18](https://youtu.be/aliu6yertgo?t=1098) years after the prophets  
[0:18:20](https://youtu.be/aliu6yertgo?t=1100) uh islam those must be man-made so then  
[0:18:22](https://youtu.be/aliu6yertgo?t=1102) i said okay fine let's agree to this  
[0:18:24](https://youtu.be/aliu6yertgo?t=1104) by your definition that means the bible  
[0:18:26](https://youtu.be/aliu6yertgo?t=1106) is inauthentic christianity is false and  
[0:18:28](https://youtu.be/aliu6yertgo?t=1108) we're left with islam that has no hadith  
[0:18:30](https://youtu.be/aliu6yertgo?t=1110) because they're a man made  
[0:18:31](https://youtu.be/aliu6yertgo?t=1111) that still doesn't deny the fact that we  
[0:18:33](https://youtu.be/aliu6yertgo?t=1113) have modern  
[0:18:34](https://youtu.be/aliu6yertgo?t=1114) uh prophecies that came true from the  
[0:18:36](https://youtu.be/aliu6yertgo?t=1116) hadiths not to mention the prophecy  
[0:18:38](https://youtu.be/aliu6yertgo?t=1118) in the persian romans you're giving him  
[0:18:40](https://youtu.be/aliu6yertgo?t=1120) too much uh the hadith were not  
[0:18:43](https://youtu.be/aliu6yertgo?t=1123) written 250 years after the prophet  
[0:18:45](https://youtu.be/aliu6yertgo?t=1125) that's categorically false  
[0:18:47](https://youtu.be/aliu6yertgo?t=1127) okay this is the compilation of  
[0:18:51](https://youtu.be/aliu6yertgo?t=1131) big macha like al-bukhari that they're  
[0:18:53](https://youtu.be/aliu6yertgo?t=1133) talking about  
[0:19:01](https://youtu.be/aliu6yertgo?t=1141) you know he had his own written hadith  
[0:19:04](https://youtu.be/aliu6yertgo?t=1144) collection  
[0:19:07](https://youtu.be/aliu6yertgo?t=1147) had his own sahih basically a big  
[0:19:11](https://youtu.be/aliu6yertgo?t=1151) number of sahaba had their own  
[0:19:14](https://youtu.be/aliu6yertgo?t=1154) had their own written  
[0:19:17](https://youtu.be/aliu6yertgo?t=1157) hadith records the prophet muhammed in  
[0:19:20](https://youtu.be/aliu6yertgo?t=1160) his own  
[0:19:20](https://youtu.be/aliu6yertgo?t=1160) life he said he said  
[0:19:25](https://youtu.be/aliu6yertgo?t=1165) uh he said rightfully  
[0:19:29](https://youtu.be/aliu6yertgo?t=1169) you know write for them what and then i  
[0:19:32](https://youtu.be/aliu6yertgo?t=1172) think it was  
[0:19:35](https://youtu.be/aliu6yertgo?t=1175) him but the hadith of could be last but  
[0:19:38](https://youtu.be/aliu6yertgo?t=1178) i have to double check  
[0:19:39](https://youtu.be/aliu6yertgo?t=1179) where he was asking him what shall i  
[0:19:41](https://youtu.be/aliu6yertgo?t=1181) write he said write anything that comes  
[0:19:43](https://youtu.be/aliu6yertgo?t=1183) out of these two  
[0:19:44](https://youtu.be/aliu6yertgo?t=1184) subhanallah this is such a powerful  
[0:19:46](https://youtu.be/aliu6yertgo?t=1186) hadith he said anything that i say  
[0:19:49](https://youtu.be/aliu6yertgo?t=1189) anything that comes out of these two  
[0:19:50](https://youtu.be/aliu6yertgo?t=1190) lips he said  
[0:19:53](https://youtu.be/aliu6yertgo?t=1193) even in the situation when you're angry  
[0:19:55](https://youtu.be/aliu6yertgo?t=1195) in this he said everything that comes  
[0:19:56](https://youtu.be/aliu6yertgo?t=1196) out of these lips write it down  
[0:19:58](https://youtu.be/aliu6yertgo?t=1198) so we have hadith the prophet telling us  
[0:20:00](https://youtu.be/aliu6yertgo?t=1200) to write everything down  
[0:20:01](https://youtu.be/aliu6yertgo?t=1201) telling the sahabah to write everything  
[0:20:03](https://youtu.be/aliu6yertgo?t=1203) down telling the sahaba to write for  
[0:20:05](https://youtu.be/aliu6yertgo?t=1205) other people  
[0:20:06](https://youtu.be/aliu6yertgo?t=1206) and then you have the compilations of  
[0:20:07](https://youtu.be/aliu6yertgo?t=1207) the sahaba like  
[0:20:10](https://youtu.be/aliu6yertgo?t=1210) you have the compilations of abu bakr  
[0:20:12](https://youtu.be/aliu6yertgo?t=1212) and these became  
[0:20:14](https://youtu.be/aliu6yertgo?t=1214) part of and then you had maybe in like  
[0:20:16](https://youtu.be/aliu6yertgo?t=1216) 110 ah  
[0:20:18](https://youtu.be/aliu6yertgo?t=1218) then you had an actual governmental  
[0:20:19](https://youtu.be/aliu6yertgo?t=1219) attempt to  
[0:20:21](https://youtu.be/aliu6yertgo?t=1221) um to do tattooing of the sunnah to  
[0:20:24](https://youtu.be/aliu6yertgo?t=1224) write down the sunnah that i wasn't  
[0:20:25](https://youtu.be/aliu6yertgo?t=1225) around but just to write it down  
[0:20:27](https://youtu.be/aliu6yertgo?t=1227) to classify it and that was spearheaded  
[0:20:30](https://youtu.be/aliu6yertgo?t=1230) by abu shayhab azhari which was way  
[0:20:32](https://youtu.be/aliu6yertgo?t=1232) before uh  
[0:20:34](https://youtu.be/aliu6yertgo?t=1234) which was way way before what you call  
[0:20:37](https://youtu.be/aliu6yertgo?t=1237) it  
[0:20:38](https://youtu.be/aliu6yertgo?t=1238) so this was like a hundred years before  
[0:20:41](https://youtu.be/aliu6yertgo?t=1241) and this was a governmental  
[0:20:43](https://youtu.be/aliu6yertgo?t=1243) thing and as still exists to this day  
[0:20:47](https://youtu.be/aliu6yertgo?t=1247) then you had imam malik and bukhari and  
[0:20:49](https://youtu.be/aliu6yertgo?t=1249) these kind of things  
[0:20:50](https://youtu.be/aliu6yertgo?t=1250) to say that you didn't have any hadith  
[0:20:52](https://youtu.be/aliu6yertgo?t=1252) written down  
[0:20:54](https://youtu.be/aliu6yertgo?t=1254) before al-bukhari and it's just  
[0:20:55](https://youtu.be/aliu6yertgo?t=1255) illiteracy it's  
[0:20:57](https://youtu.be/aliu6yertgo?t=1257) jahil and we cannot allow them to impose  
[0:20:59](https://youtu.be/aliu6yertgo?t=1259) the ignorance on us  
[0:21:01](https://youtu.be/aliu6yertgo?t=1261) it's as simple as that ahadis were they  
[0:21:04](https://youtu.be/aliu6yertgo?t=1264) were  
[0:21:05](https://youtu.be/aliu6yertgo?t=1265) actually i i say today with all  
[0:21:08](https://youtu.be/aliu6yertgo?t=1268) uh with all confidence that there is no  
[0:21:12](https://youtu.be/aliu6yertgo?t=1272) system in the world  
[0:21:13](https://youtu.be/aliu6yertgo?t=1273) historical system that even comes close  
[0:21:16](https://youtu.be/aliu6yertgo?t=1276) to the method of the hadith nothing  
[0:21:19](https://youtu.be/aliu6yertgo?t=1279) you have to have five conditions for  
[0:21:21](https://youtu.be/aliu6yertgo?t=1281) hadith  
[0:21:23](https://youtu.be/aliu6yertgo?t=1283) five conditions that it cannot have  
[0:21:25](https://youtu.be/aliu6yertgo?t=1285) defects it cannot be anomalous  
[0:21:28](https://youtu.be/aliu6yertgo?t=1288) it cannot be in con anomalous meaning it  
[0:21:30](https://youtu.be/aliu6yertgo?t=1290) cannot be  
[0:21:32](https://youtu.be/aliu6yertgo?t=1292) in a contradiction to something which  
[0:21:35](https://youtu.be/aliu6yertgo?t=1295) someone who is more historically  
[0:21:36](https://youtu.be/aliu6yertgo?t=1296) qualified  
[0:21:37](https://youtu.be/aliu6yertgo?t=1297) said it has to be  
[0:21:41](https://youtu.be/aliu6yertgo?t=1301) senate it has to be completely in line  
[0:21:44](https://youtu.be/aliu6yertgo?t=1304) in terms of  
[0:21:45](https://youtu.be/aliu6yertgo?t=1305) the chain of narration the person has to  
[0:21:47](https://youtu.be/aliu6yertgo?t=1307) have good writing skills  
[0:21:49](https://youtu.be/aliu6yertgo?t=1309) can't be just anybody in a rating or  
[0:21:51](https://youtu.be/aliu6yertgo?t=1311) good heads  
[0:21:52](https://youtu.be/aliu6yertgo?t=1312) and it has to be which means  
[0:21:53](https://youtu.be/aliu6yertgo?t=1313) memorization and the person has to have  
[0:21:55](https://youtu.be/aliu6yertgo?t=1315) a good  
[0:21:55](https://youtu.be/aliu6yertgo?t=1315) track record meaning have adela these  
[0:21:58](https://youtu.be/aliu6yertgo?t=1318) are the five  
[0:21:59](https://youtu.be/aliu6yertgo?t=1319) conditions and under each of these  
[0:22:01](https://youtu.be/aliu6yertgo?t=1321) conditions there are sub-conditions and  
[0:22:02](https://youtu.be/aliu6yertgo?t=1322) more sub-conditions  
[0:22:04](https://youtu.be/aliu6yertgo?t=1324) we are talking about a situation there's  
[0:22:06](https://youtu.be/aliu6yertgo?t=1326) no historical method known to man that  
[0:22:09](https://youtu.be/aliu6yertgo?t=1329) has this kind of detail  
[0:22:10](https://youtu.be/aliu6yertgo?t=1330) how can this people be talking to us  
[0:22:12](https://youtu.be/aliu6yertgo?t=1332) about history  
[0:22:13](https://youtu.be/aliu6yertgo?t=1333) honestly how can he how dare he talk  
[0:22:15](https://youtu.be/aliu6yertgo?t=1335) about pork  
[0:22:16](https://youtu.be/aliu6yertgo?t=1336) paul davis saw jesus he wrote 13 books  
[0:22:19](https://youtu.be/aliu6yertgo?t=1339) according to the majority opinion of the  
[0:22:20](https://youtu.be/aliu6yertgo?t=1340) new testament  
[0:22:22](https://youtu.be/aliu6yertgo?t=1342) none of them are eyewitness testimonies  
[0:22:23](https://youtu.be/aliu6yertgo?t=1343) why are his books even in the new  
[0:22:25](https://youtu.be/aliu6yertgo?t=1345) testament  
[0:22:26](https://youtu.be/aliu6yertgo?t=1346) he never saw them again his dreams and  
[0:22:28](https://youtu.be/aliu6yertgo?t=1348) stuff like that how dare you bring that  
[0:22:30](https://youtu.be/aliu6yertgo?t=1350) and compare it to how these eyewitness  
[0:22:31](https://youtu.be/aliu6yertgo?t=1351) testimonies  
[0:22:32](https://youtu.be/aliu6yertgo?t=1352) you know how many ideas you ever have  
[0:22:33](https://youtu.be/aliu6yertgo?t=1353) tens of thousands of hadith  
[0:22:36](https://youtu.be/aliu6yertgo?t=1356) you know we even you can even say we  
[0:22:37](https://youtu.be/aliu6yertgo?t=1357) have hundreds of thousands of hadith  
[0:22:39](https://youtu.be/aliu6yertgo?t=1359) you know and some say even millions but  
[0:22:41](https://youtu.be/aliu6yertgo?t=1361) you know how many made the final cut of  
[0:22:43](https://youtu.be/aliu6yertgo?t=1363) sahih hadith authentically  
[0:22:45](https://youtu.be/aliu6yertgo?t=1365) maximum ten thousand so of hundreds of  
[0:22:48](https://youtu.be/aliu6yertgo?t=1368) thousands hadith  
[0:22:49](https://youtu.be/aliu6yertgo?t=1369) the ones that according to no we made it  
[0:22:51](https://youtu.be/aliu6yertgo?t=1371) through the final cut is like ten  
[0:22:52](https://youtu.be/aliu6yertgo?t=1372) thousand hadith which means we actually  
[0:22:54](https://youtu.be/aliu6yertgo?t=1374) are the biggest hadith rejecters we  
[0:22:56](https://youtu.be/aliu6yertgo?t=1376) reject the majority of hadith  
[0:22:58](https://youtu.be/aliu6yertgo?t=1378) but we accept the hadith which fulfill  
[0:22:59](https://youtu.be/aliu6yertgo?t=1379) the criterion of rigorousness and  
[0:23:01](https://youtu.be/aliu6yertgo?t=1381) authenticity  
[0:23:03](https://youtu.be/aliu6yertgo?t=1383) and this is a that's like what we're  
[0:23:04](https://youtu.be/aliu6yertgo?t=1384) talking about one percent or like two  
[0:23:06](https://youtu.be/aliu6yertgo?t=1386) percent of the hadith  
[0:23:07](https://youtu.be/aliu6yertgo?t=1387) we and those hadith basically give us  
[0:23:09](https://youtu.be/aliu6yertgo?t=1389) all the information we need to live our  
[0:23:11](https://youtu.be/aliu6yertgo?t=1391) lives you know these  
[0:23:12](https://youtu.be/aliu6yertgo?t=1392) these christians uh when they come up  
[0:23:14](https://youtu.be/aliu6yertgo?t=1394) with these types of arguments  
[0:23:16](https://youtu.be/aliu6yertgo?t=1396) i honestly just envisioned someone with  
[0:23:19](https://youtu.be/aliu6yertgo?t=1399) a butter knife trying to cut a diamond  
[0:23:23](https://youtu.be/aliu6yertgo?t=1403) well where'd you get this metaphors from  
[0:23:25](https://youtu.be/aliu6yertgo?t=1405) this guy is like a metaphor machine man  
[0:23:27](https://youtu.be/aliu6yertgo?t=1407) so he is because ultimately he'll just  
[0:23:31](https://youtu.be/aliu6yertgo?t=1411) bend the knife because  
[0:23:32](https://youtu.be/aliu6yertgo?t=1412) honestly if we look at the islamic  
[0:23:36](https://youtu.be/aliu6yertgo?t=1416) um uh way of compiling these narrations  
[0:23:40](https://youtu.be/aliu6yertgo?t=1420) the prophet  
[0:23:40](https://youtu.be/aliu6yertgo?t=1420) peace be upon him we even saved the ones  
[0:23:43](https://youtu.be/aliu6yertgo?t=1423) which we know are forgeries  
[0:23:45](https://youtu.be/aliu6yertgo?t=1425) so that if they reappear we know  
[0:23:47](https://youtu.be/aliu6yertgo?t=1427) actually here is this forgery and here's  
[0:23:49](https://youtu.be/aliu6yertgo?t=1429) when it was forged  
[0:23:50](https://youtu.be/aliu6yertgo?t=1430) which is which is allah we've got to  
[0:23:52](https://youtu.be/aliu6yertgo?t=1432) classify different types of forgery  
[0:23:54](https://youtu.be/aliu6yertgo?t=1434) hadith  
[0:23:55](https://youtu.be/aliu6yertgo?t=1435) is different which is different to  
[0:23:58](https://youtu.be/aliu6yertgo?t=1438) hadith  
[0:23:58](https://youtu.be/aliu6yertgo?t=1438) people think they're all the same thing  
[0:24:00](https://youtu.be/aliu6yertgo?t=1440) no we can't is not just one category  
[0:24:02](https://youtu.be/aliu6yertgo?t=1442) like a  
[0:24:02](https://youtu.be/aliu6yertgo?t=1442) ba someone who's a liar right this this  
[0:24:05](https://youtu.be/aliu6yertgo?t=1445) hadith is not only rejected but it's  
[0:24:07](https://youtu.be/aliu6yertgo?t=1447) like you said it's saved in the books of  
[0:24:08](https://youtu.be/aliu6yertgo?t=1448) whatever and so on so if we  
[0:24:10](https://youtu.be/aliu6yertgo?t=1450) see this guy again reject him like come  
[0:24:13](https://youtu.be/aliu6yertgo?t=1453) on man  
[0:24:13](https://youtu.be/aliu6yertgo?t=1453) they're coming everything you know if we  
[0:24:15](https://youtu.be/aliu6yertgo?t=1455) had the bible in our hands and we  
[0:24:16](https://youtu.be/aliu6yertgo?t=1456) applied the same  
[0:24:17](https://youtu.be/aliu6yertgo?t=1457) rigorous thing do you know what would be  
[0:24:18](https://youtu.be/aliu6yertgo?t=1458) left of it nothing nothing  
[0:24:20](https://youtu.be/aliu6yertgo?t=1460) nothing nothing and that yeah that was  
[0:24:23](https://youtu.be/aliu6yertgo?t=1463) the standard if the bible was it was if  
[0:24:24](https://youtu.be/aliu6yertgo?t=1464) the bible was left in the hands of the  
[0:24:26](https://youtu.be/aliu6yertgo?t=1466) muhammad  
[0:24:27](https://youtu.be/aliu6yertgo?t=1467) [Laughter]  
[0:24:28](https://youtu.be/aliu6yertgo?t=1468) right and that was kind  
[0:24:31](https://youtu.be/aliu6yertgo?t=1471) know what the bible would we would have  
[0:24:34](https://youtu.be/aliu6yertgo?t=1474) the bible and every single fabrication  
[0:24:37](https://youtu.be/aliu6yertgo?t=1477) would be allocated to the same period  
[0:24:39](https://youtu.be/aliu6yertgo?t=1479) you'd actually have a genealogy of all  
[0:24:40](https://youtu.be/aliu6yertgo?t=1480) of the fabrications  
[0:24:42](https://youtu.be/aliu6yertgo?t=1482) basically the bible is the of our books  
[0:24:44](https://youtu.be/aliu6yertgo?t=1484) of fabrication  
[0:24:46](https://youtu.be/aliu6yertgo?t=1486) and weak hadith that's what it is  
[0:24:49](https://youtu.be/aliu6yertgo?t=1489) that's all it is man they can't come to  
[0:24:50](https://youtu.be/aliu6yertgo?t=1490) us and tell us anything  
[0:24:52](https://youtu.be/aliu6yertgo?t=1492) symbolize that really honestly at the  
[0:24:54](https://youtu.be/aliu6yertgo?t=1494) end of the art day my biggest question  
[0:24:56](https://youtu.be/aliu6yertgo?t=1496) was does this make islam false or does  
[0:24:58](https://youtu.be/aliu6yertgo?t=1498) this make christianity fall so those  
[0:24:59](https://youtu.be/aliu6yertgo?t=1499) were the questions those the big  
[0:25:00](https://youtu.be/aliu6yertgo?t=1500) questions i was asking so at the end of  
[0:25:02](https://youtu.be/aliu6yertgo?t=1502) the day  
[0:25:02](https://youtu.be/aliu6yertgo?t=1502) we have proof right islam has proved  
[0:25:04](https://youtu.be/aliu6yertgo?t=1504) christianity has no proof i think wish  
[0:25:06](https://youtu.be/aliu6yertgo?t=1506) dates  
[0:25:07](https://youtu.be/aliu6yertgo?t=1507) okay so brother you said some say what's  
[0:25:09](https://youtu.be/aliu6yertgo?t=1509) your name again  
[0:25:12](https://youtu.be/aliu6yertgo?t=1512) what's your actual name uh bilal  
[0:25:16](https://youtu.be/aliu6yertgo?t=1516) bilal right you know you said something  
[0:25:19](https://youtu.be/aliu6yertgo?t=1519) so intelligent and i just want to really  
[0:25:21](https://youtu.be/aliu6yertgo?t=1521) commend you for it  
[0:25:23](https://youtu.be/aliu6yertgo?t=1523) we have to ask this question all right  
[0:25:26](https://youtu.be/aliu6yertgo?t=1526) is this something which means islam is  
[0:25:29](https://youtu.be/aliu6yertgo?t=1529) false and your worldview is correct  
[0:25:30](https://youtu.be/aliu6yertgo?t=1530) because this way of thinking wallahi if  
[0:25:33](https://youtu.be/aliu6yertgo?t=1533) we apply this to the vast majority of  
[0:25:35](https://youtu.be/aliu6yertgo?t=1535) the issues which  
[0:25:36](https://youtu.be/aliu6yertgo?t=1536) are being challenged which are being  
[0:25:38](https://youtu.be/aliu6yertgo?t=1538) against islam  
[0:25:40](https://youtu.be/aliu6yertgo?t=1540) we will find that actually the answer is  
[0:25:43](https://youtu.be/aliu6yertgo?t=1543) no too much race  
[0:25:44](https://youtu.be/aliu6yertgo?t=1544) right you know i often get asked  
[0:25:46](https://youtu.be/aliu6yertgo?t=1546) questions of  
[0:25:47](https://youtu.be/aliu6yertgo?t=1547) you know oh there's this new fossil that  
[0:25:49](https://youtu.be/aliu6yertgo?t=1549) we've discovered  
[0:25:50](https://youtu.be/aliu6yertgo?t=1550) dennis ovens and they had this burial  
[0:25:52](https://youtu.be/aliu6yertgo?t=1552) ritual i mean i i made a mockery of this  
[0:25:55](https://youtu.be/aliu6yertgo?t=1555) i actually made a video  
[0:25:56](https://youtu.be/aliu6yertgo?t=1556) called was homo erectus hanafi  
[0:26:00](https://youtu.be/aliu6yertgo?t=1560) these questions are irrelevant it's  
[0:26:02](https://youtu.be/aliu6yertgo?t=1562) totally irrelevant does this mean islam  
[0:26:04](https://youtu.be/aliu6yertgo?t=1564) is false no  
[0:26:05](https://youtu.be/aliu6yertgo?t=1565) does this mean your worldview is correct  
[0:26:07](https://youtu.be/aliu6yertgo?t=1567) no then why are you asking me  
[0:26:10](https://youtu.be/aliu6yertgo?t=1570) another way like we've got to look at  
[0:26:12](https://youtu.be/aliu6yertgo?t=1572) that which has religion disproving  
[0:26:14](https://youtu.be/aliu6yertgo?t=1574) implications  
[0:26:15](https://youtu.be/aliu6yertgo?t=1575) yes yes exactly that's that was we don't

[0:26:27](https://youtu.be/aliu6yertgo?t=1587) to go further to be honest  
[0:26:28](https://youtu.be/aliu6yertgo?t=1588) and just keep it as simple as that yeah  
[0:26:30](https://youtu.be/aliu6yertgo?t=1590) can i yeah

[0:26:40](https://youtu.be/aliu6yertgo?t=1600) the prophecies christianity  
[0:26:42](https://youtu.be/aliu6yertgo?t=1602) it's like we don't need to do anything  
[0:26:44](https://youtu.be/aliu6yertgo?t=1604) because they can't get past the trinity  
[0:26:46](https://youtu.be/aliu6yertgo?t=1606) thing  
[0:26:46](https://youtu.be/aliu6yertgo?t=1606) they can't get incarnation they can't  
[0:26:48](https://youtu.be/aliu6yertgo?t=1608) get past it it's just it's impossible to  
[0:26:50](https://youtu.be/aliu6yertgo?t=1610) get past it  
[0:26:51](https://youtu.be/aliu6yertgo?t=1611) it's impossible to get past it you get  
[0:26:53](https://youtu.be/aliu6yertgo?t=1613) the best logician in the whole wide  
[0:26:55](https://youtu.be/aliu6yertgo?t=1615) world  
[0:26:56](https://youtu.be/aliu6yertgo?t=1616) and the best um thinker and philosopher  
[0:26:58](https://youtu.be/aliu6yertgo?t=1618) no one's going apart  
[0:26:59](https://youtu.be/aliu6yertgo?t=1619) and no one's gonna get past incarnation  
[0:27:01](https://youtu.be/aliu6yertgo?t=1621) yep many prophets one message actually  
[0:27:04](https://youtu.be/aliu6yertgo?t=1624) posted a video about two weeks ago  
[0:27:05](https://youtu.be/aliu6yertgo?t=1625) talking about the  
[0:27:06](https://youtu.be/aliu6yertgo?t=1626) history of paul and the origins of the  
[0:27:08](https://youtu.be/aliu6yertgo?t=1628) bible yeah  
[0:27:11](https://youtu.be/aliu6yertgo?t=1631) i'm not sure i i should do it yeah it  
[0:27:13](https://youtu.be/aliu6yertgo?t=1633) was like a 15 minute video but  
[0:27:14](https://youtu.be/aliu6yertgo?t=1634) alhamdulillah  
[0:27:15](https://youtu.be/aliu6yertgo?t=1635) it was so informative it completely  
[0:27:18](https://youtu.be/aliu6yertgo?t=1638) destroyed christianity i took notes on  
[0:27:20](https://youtu.be/aliu6yertgo?t=1640) it like crazy  
[0:27:22](https://youtu.be/aliu6yertgo?t=1642) the guy who authors that stuff is like  
[0:27:24](https://youtu.be/aliu6yertgo?t=1644) you know one of the main researchers  
[0:27:26](https://youtu.be/aliu6yertgo?t=1646) right now yeah yeah  
[0:27:30](https://youtu.be/aliu6yertgo?t=1650) he's he's he genuinely i think he's a

[0:27:34](https://youtu.be/aliu6yertgo?t=1654) probably the most  
[0:27:36](https://youtu.be/aliu6yertgo?t=1656) uh in the debate with david wood a lot i  
[0:27:38](https://youtu.be/aliu6yertgo?t=1658) use a lot of his research material and  
[0:27:41](https://youtu.be/aliu6yertgo?t=1661) he he produced a lot of stuff ira as you  
[0:27:43](https://youtu.be/aliu6yertgo?t=1663) know he wrote the book for women  
[0:27:44](https://youtu.be/aliu6yertgo?t=1664) prophecies  
[0:27:45](https://youtu.be/aliu6yertgo?t=1665) yeah yeah yeah that was the book  
[0:27:51](https://youtu.be/aliu6yertgo?t=1671) this book also other materials he  
[0:27:53](https://youtu.be/aliu6yertgo?t=1673) proofreads them  
[0:27:54](https://youtu.be/aliu6yertgo?t=1674) um i'm actually talking to him right now  
[0:27:58](https://youtu.be/aliu6yertgo?t=1678) he's always doing stuff right now  
[0:28:04](https://youtu.be/aliu6yertgo?t=1684) not only this you know this brother he  
[0:28:07](https://youtu.be/aliu6yertgo?t=1687) is actually in full-time work  
[0:28:08](https://youtu.be/aliu6yertgo?t=1688) and he's doing all of this stuff says oh  
[0:28:11](https://youtu.be/aliu6yertgo?t=1691) i i need um  
[0:28:13](https://youtu.be/aliu6yertgo?t=1693) you know i need time the fact is you  
[0:28:16](https://youtu.be/aliu6yertgo?t=1696) have time for things which are important  
[0:28:17](https://youtu.be/aliu6yertgo?t=1697) you have a  
[0:28:18](https://youtu.be/aliu6yertgo?t=1698) you know what you have what is this guy  
[0:28:20](https://youtu.be/aliu6yertgo?t=1700) yeah yeah definitely  
[0:28:22](https://youtu.be/aliu6yertgo?t=1702) did there's this idea me and hamza used  
[0:28:24](https://youtu.be/aliu6yertgo?t=1704) to discuss the collateral  
[0:28:26](https://youtu.be/aliu6yertgo?t=1706) damage theory of time yeah meaning you  
[0:28:29](https://youtu.be/aliu6yertgo?t=1709) chuck in  
[0:28:29](https://youtu.be/aliu6yertgo?t=1709) everything in your calendar and the most  
[0:28:31](https://youtu.be/aliu6yertgo?t=1711) important things get done  
[0:28:32](https://youtu.be/aliu6yertgo?t=1712) it's like this here it's like if you get  
[0:28:34](https://youtu.be/aliu6yertgo?t=1714) a jar and you put rocks in the jar then  
[0:28:36](https://youtu.be/aliu6yertgo?t=1716) you put sand  
[0:28:37](https://youtu.be/aliu6yertgo?t=1717) the sand of the small things they fill  
[0:28:39](https://youtu.be/aliu6yertgo?t=1719) in but if you put in sand first  
[0:28:41](https://youtu.be/aliu6yertgo?t=1721) then you try and put in rocks the rocks  
[0:28:43](https://youtu.be/aliu6yertgo?t=1723) don't fit so in your life you do the  
[0:28:45](https://youtu.be/aliu6yertgo?t=1725) biggest most important things first  
[0:28:46](https://youtu.be/aliu6yertgo?t=1726) everything else fits  
[0:28:48](https://youtu.be/aliu6yertgo?t=1728) so people who love allah people who love  
[0:28:49](https://youtu.be/aliu6yertgo?t=1729) the dawah they will always find times  
[0:28:52](https://youtu.be/aliu6yertgo?t=1732) for these things  
[0:28:57](https://youtu.be/aliu6yertgo?t=1737) definitely definitely you know and um uh  
[0:29:00](https://youtu.be/aliu6yertgo?t=1740) allah is time you have if there if you  
[0:29:03](https://youtu.be/aliu6yertgo?t=1743) have a will to give allah you know he's  
[0:29:06](https://youtu.be/aliu6yertgo?t=1746) right in terms of  
[0:29:07](https://youtu.be/aliu6yertgo?t=1747) all this kind of stuff allah will give  
[0:29:08](https://youtu.be/aliu6yertgo?t=1748) you barack on your time  
[0:29:11](https://youtu.be/aliu6yertgo?t=1751) you know whatever the tao is the thing  
[0:29:12](https://youtu.be/aliu6yertgo?t=1752) like people don't realize how important  
[0:29:14](https://youtu.be/aliu6yertgo?t=1754) that  
[0:29:14](https://youtu.be/aliu6yertgo?t=1754) is if you read the quran and you don't  
[0:29:17](https://youtu.be/aliu6yertgo?t=1757) conclude  
[0:29:17](https://youtu.be/aliu6yertgo?t=1757) from it then you haven't read the quran  
[0:29:19](https://youtu.be/aliu6yertgo?t=1759) either you're ignorant or you may be  
[0:29:20](https://youtu.be/aliu6yertgo?t=1760) drunk  
[0:29:21](https://youtu.be/aliu6yertgo?t=1761) you know you know you know adnan said  
[0:29:23](https://youtu.be/aliu6yertgo?t=1763) this the other day adnan said we can  
[0:29:26](https://youtu.be/aliu6yertgo?t=1766) describe the quran  
[0:29:28](https://youtu.be/aliu6yertgo?t=1768) or part of the quran as a dawah diary  
[0:29:30](https://youtu.be/aliu6yertgo?t=1770) because it is the experiences of the  
[0:29:32](https://youtu.be/aliu6yertgo?t=1772) prophets with their nations  
[0:29:34](https://youtu.be/aliu6yertgo?t=1774) absolutely and you know it's amazing  
[0:29:35](https://youtu.be/aliu6yertgo?t=1775) it's like all the prophets were engaged  
[0:29:37](https://youtu.be/aliu6yertgo?t=1777) in every single one of them was engaged  
[0:29:39](https://youtu.be/aliu6yertgo?t=1779) in that  
[0:29:39](https://youtu.be/aliu6yertgo?t=1779) not every single one of them the quran  
[0:29:40](https://youtu.be/aliu6yertgo?t=1780) tells us how they engage in war not  
[0:29:42](https://youtu.be/aliu6yertgo?t=1782) everyone's seeing one of them is engaged  
[0:29:43](https://youtu.be/aliu6yertgo?t=1783) in like  
[0:29:44](https://youtu.be/aliu6yertgo?t=1784) he doesn't allow us to mention that his  
[0:29:45](https://youtu.be/aliu6yertgo?t=1785) death hits him to us but every single  
[0:29:47](https://youtu.be/aliu6yertgo?t=1787) prophet in the quran  
[0:29:49](https://youtu.be/aliu6yertgo?t=1789) every single every single one has been  
[0:29:51](https://youtu.be/aliu6yertgo?t=1791) described in the context of doubt  
[0:30:17](https://youtu.be/aliu6yertgo?t=1817) we're gonna move on because there's  
[0:30:18](https://youtu.be/aliu6yertgo?t=1818) quite a few people waiting jazakallah  
[0:30:32](https://youtu.be/aliu6yertgo?t=1832) yes we can okay so here's my question  
[0:30:35](https://youtu.be/aliu6yertgo?t=1835) shall we  
[0:30:36](https://youtu.be/aliu6yertgo?t=1836) my question is it has a bit of context  
[0:30:38](https://youtu.be/aliu6yertgo?t=1838) to it my question is that  
[0:30:39](https://youtu.be/aliu6yertgo?t=1839) essentially i was having a conversation  
[0:30:41](https://youtu.be/aliu6yertgo?t=1841) with an atheist  
[0:30:43](https://youtu.be/aliu6yertgo?t=1843) and they were attempting to disprove the  
[0:30:45](https://youtu.be/aliu6yertgo?t=1845) quran  
[0:30:46](https://youtu.be/aliu6yertgo?t=1846) using science right and i was explaining  
[0:30:48](https://youtu.be/aliu6yertgo?t=1848) how this doesn't really make sense  
[0:30:50](https://youtu.be/aliu6yertgo?t=1850) because you can't use the  
[0:30:51](https://youtu.be/aliu6yertgo?t=1851) size to disprove the quran because if  
[0:30:54](https://youtu.be/aliu6yertgo?t=1854) the quran says something  
[0:30:56](https://youtu.be/aliu6yertgo?t=1856) and it conflicts with the most prevalent  
[0:30:58](https://youtu.be/aliu6yertgo?t=1858) scientific theory  
[0:30:59](https://youtu.be/aliu6yertgo?t=1859) it's based on induction right and it  
[0:31:02](https://youtu.be/aliu6yertgo?t=1862) could be  
[0:31:02](https://youtu.be/aliu6yertgo?t=1862) overturned in a few years or something  
[0:31:04](https://youtu.be/aliu6yertgo?t=1864) and you guys know this better than i do  
[0:31:06](https://youtu.be/aliu6yertgo?t=1866) right  
[0:31:06](https://youtu.be/aliu6yertgo?t=1866) so then he said to me do you use history  
[0:31:10](https://youtu.be/aliu6yertgo?t=1870) to prove the quran right and i said yes  
[0:31:12](https://youtu.be/aliu6yertgo?t=1872) he said history is based on induction  
[0:31:15](https://youtu.be/aliu6yertgo?t=1875) right for example um if there was a  
[0:31:18](https://youtu.be/aliu6yertgo?t=1878) bunch of  
[0:31:18](https://youtu.be/aliu6yertgo?t=1878) historians they came together and said  
[0:31:20](https://youtu.be/aliu6yertgo?t=1880) we believe that at the time of  
[0:31:22](https://youtu.be/aliu6yertgo?t=1882) yusuf alayhi salaam they were called um  
[0:31:26](https://youtu.be/aliu6yertgo?t=1886) the king the pharaoh was actually called  
[0:31:28](https://youtu.be/aliu6yertgo?t=1888) the pharaoh it was used as the house and  
[0:31:30](https://youtu.be/aliu6yertgo?t=1890) this is something which is used this is  
[0:31:32](https://youtu.be/aliu6yertgo?t=1892) has  
[0:31:32](https://youtu.be/aliu6yertgo?t=1892) evidence to it right but maybe  
[0:31:35](https://youtu.be/aliu6yertgo?t=1895) miraculously it can be turned on its  
[0:31:37](https://youtu.be/aliu6yertgo?t=1897) head in a few years and they'll say oh  
[0:31:38](https://youtu.be/aliu6yertgo?t=1898) we messed up and  
[0:31:39](https://youtu.be/aliu6yertgo?t=1899) changed their whole prevalent theory  
[0:31:41](https://youtu.be/aliu6yertgo?t=1901) yeah so if  
[0:31:42](https://youtu.be/aliu6yertgo?t=1902) we can't use the crime  
[0:31:45](https://youtu.be/aliu6yertgo?t=1905) with science to prove it's true because  
[0:31:47](https://youtu.be/aliu6yertgo?t=1907) it's not absolutely true is it not  
[0:31:49](https://youtu.be/aliu6yertgo?t=1909) inconsistent that our muslims  
[0:31:51](https://youtu.be/aliu6yertgo?t=1911) use history that's true because it's a  
[0:31:53](https://youtu.be/aliu6yertgo?t=1913) good point you're making and it's a good  
[0:31:54](https://youtu.be/aliu6yertgo?t=1914) point it's true that  
[0:31:56](https://youtu.be/aliu6yertgo?t=1916) the historical enterprise does does  
[0:31:58](https://youtu.be/aliu6yertgo?t=1918) depend on some kind of induction  
[0:32:00](https://youtu.be/aliu6yertgo?t=1920) one we've never made the argument that  
[0:32:02](https://youtu.be/aliu6yertgo?t=1922) we can't use science  
[0:32:04](https://youtu.be/aliu6yertgo?t=1924) uh to talk about the quran or that some  
[0:32:07](https://youtu.be/aliu6yertgo?t=1927) scientific things are not understood  
[0:32:08](https://youtu.be/aliu6yertgo?t=1928) like for example  
[0:32:09](https://youtu.be/aliu6yertgo?t=1929) human being is x the man is xy  
[0:32:11](https://youtu.be/aliu6yertgo?t=1931) chromosome the woman's x  
[0:32:15](https://youtu.be/aliu6yertgo?t=1935) if we didn't believe that was qatari and  
[0:32:17](https://youtu.be/aliu6yertgo?t=1937) that there was there was which means  
[0:32:18](https://youtu.be/aliu6yertgo?t=1938) certain which means  
[0:32:19](https://youtu.be/aliu6yertgo?t=1939) the some possibility that a man can have  
[0:32:21](https://youtu.be/aliu6yertgo?t=1941) bxx and that they're going to overturn  
[0:32:23](https://youtu.be/aliu6yertgo?t=1943) that  
[0:32:23](https://youtu.be/aliu6yertgo?t=1943) or that they're going to overturn the  
[0:32:25](https://youtu.be/aliu6yertgo?t=1945) fact that man has hormones in his body  
[0:32:27](https://youtu.be/aliu6yertgo?t=1947) or that he's differentiated from the  
[0:32:28](https://youtu.be/aliu6yertgo?t=1948) woman  
[0:32:29](https://youtu.be/aliu6yertgo?t=1949) then really we could overturn so many  
[0:32:31](https://youtu.be/aliu6yertgo?t=1951) things that can we're going to lead to  
[0:32:32](https://youtu.be/aliu6yertgo?t=1952) post-modernist ridiculousness  
[0:32:34](https://youtu.be/aliu6yertgo?t=1954) now it would lead to a kind of  
[0:32:35](https://youtu.be/aliu6yertgo?t=1955) post-modernist absurdity  
[0:32:37](https://youtu.be/aliu6yertgo?t=1957) so we are not proposing that because  
[0:32:40](https://youtu.be/aliu6yertgo?t=1960) science is filled with induction  
[0:32:42](https://youtu.be/aliu6yertgo?t=1962) therefore  
[0:32:42](https://youtu.be/aliu6yertgo?t=1962) science is not something we use we're  
[0:32:44](https://youtu.be/aliu6yertgo?t=1964) saying that  
[0:32:45](https://youtu.be/aliu6yertgo?t=1965) a lot of the time when people do the  
[0:32:47](https://youtu.be/aliu6yertgo?t=1967) scientific miracle stuff they make the  
[0:32:48](https://youtu.be/aliu6yertgo?t=1968) wrong argument  
[0:32:49](https://youtu.be/aliu6yertgo?t=1969) the arguments that has been historically  
[0:32:51](https://youtu.be/aliu6yertgo?t=1971) made about the scientific  
[0:32:53](https://youtu.be/aliu6yertgo?t=1973) miracle thing is this couldn't have been  
[0:32:55](https://youtu.be/aliu6yertgo?t=1975) known at the time we're saying that  
[0:32:56](https://youtu.be/aliu6yertgo?t=1976) argument is not a good argument because  
[0:32:58](https://youtu.be/aliu6yertgo?t=1978) most of the things  
[0:32:58](https://youtu.be/aliu6yertgo?t=1978) talked about in the quran about science  
[0:33:01](https://youtu.be/aliu6yertgo?t=1981) there have been something  
[0:33:02](https://youtu.be/aliu6yertgo?t=1982) said somewhere by some civilization in  
[0:33:05](https://youtu.be/aliu6yertgo?t=1985) the past  
[0:33:06](https://youtu.be/aliu6yertgo?t=1986) and so that part of it's not good idea  
[0:33:08](https://youtu.be/aliu6yertgo?t=1988) well if you mention some of the theories  
[0:33:09](https://youtu.be/aliu6yertgo?t=1989) like the big bang theory  
[0:33:11](https://youtu.be/aliu6yertgo?t=1991) um the problem with that is number one  
[0:33:13](https://youtu.be/aliu6yertgo?t=1993) the ayat a bit ambiguous  
[0:33:15](https://youtu.be/aliu6yertgo?t=1995) number two is that there are other  
[0:33:16](https://youtu.be/aliu6yertgo?t=1996) theories which you reject  
[0:33:19](https://youtu.be/aliu6yertgo?t=1999) like for example darwinism and stuff  
[0:33:20](https://youtu.be/aliu6yertgo?t=2000) like that even though the evidence  
[0:33:22](https://youtu.be/aliu6yertgo?t=2002) could potentially you know  
[0:33:25](https://youtu.be/aliu6yertgo?t=2005) be be said to be or seen to be at least  
[0:33:28](https://youtu.be/aliu6yertgo?t=2008) the same level as big bang theory  
[0:33:30](https://youtu.be/aliu6yertgo?t=2010) we're saying that the methodology  
[0:33:31](https://youtu.be/aliu6yertgo?t=2011) reviews of science therefore is not the  
[0:33:33](https://youtu.be/aliu6yertgo?t=2013) best  
[0:33:33](https://youtu.be/aliu6yertgo?t=2013) but there are some things which i  
[0:33:34](https://youtu.be/aliu6yertgo?t=2014) personally believe fit  
[0:33:36](https://youtu.be/aliu6yertgo?t=2016) they they passed a threshold of  
[0:33:39](https://youtu.be/aliu6yertgo?t=2019) acceptability in my eyes  
[0:33:40](https://youtu.be/aliu6yertgo?t=2020) like for example like we said what  
[0:33:43](https://youtu.be/aliu6yertgo?t=2023) constitutes a man what constitutes a  
[0:33:44](https://youtu.be/aliu6yertgo?t=2024) woman  
[0:33:45](https://youtu.be/aliu6yertgo?t=2025) the uh pregnancy period for a woman  
[0:33:47](https://youtu.be/aliu6yertgo?t=2027) these are all scientific things by the  
[0:33:48](https://youtu.be/aliu6yertgo?t=2028) way  
[0:33:49](https://youtu.be/aliu6yertgo?t=2029) but we don't think they're going to be  
[0:33:50](https://youtu.be/aliu6yertgo?t=2030) overturned we don't think that a woman's  
[0:33:53](https://youtu.be/aliu6yertgo?t=2033) pregnancy they're going to discover  
[0:33:54](https://youtu.be/aliu6yertgo?t=2034) something about that we don't think that  
[0:33:56](https://youtu.be/aliu6yertgo?t=2036) about the form of the man  
[0:34:00](https://youtu.be/aliu6yertgo?t=2040) we don't think that's going to happen we  
[0:34:01](https://youtu.be/aliu6yertgo?t=2041) don't think xyz so  
[0:34:03](https://youtu.be/aliu6yertgo?t=2043) we say yes you're right on the on on the  
[0:34:07](https://youtu.be/aliu6yertgo?t=2047) basis of probability so it's always  
[0:34:08](https://youtu.be/aliu6yertgo?t=2048) going to be probabilistic reasoning  
[0:34:10](https://youtu.be/aliu6yertgo?t=2050) that both of them use induction however  
[0:34:12](https://youtu.be/aliu6yertgo?t=2052) history has an added advantage  
[0:34:14](https://youtu.be/aliu6yertgo?t=2054) which is that it has a retrospective  
[0:34:16](https://youtu.be/aliu6yertgo?t=2056) perspective  
[0:34:18](https://youtu.be/aliu6yertgo?t=2058) now let me tell you why this is  
[0:34:19](https://youtu.be/aliu6yertgo?t=2059) important that which has happened in the  
[0:34:20](https://youtu.be/aliu6yertgo?t=2060) past  
[0:34:21](https://youtu.be/aliu6yertgo?t=2061) is unlikely to change whereas that which  
[0:34:24](https://youtu.be/aliu6yertgo?t=2064) is  
[0:34:25](https://youtu.be/aliu6yertgo?t=2065) based on a falsification of the future  
[0:34:27](https://youtu.be/aliu6yertgo?t=2067) has more probability to change  
[0:34:29](https://youtu.be/aliu6yertgo?t=2069) for example string theory for example  
[0:34:31](https://youtu.be/aliu6yertgo?t=2071) quantum mechanics for example the big  
[0:34:33](https://youtu.be/aliu6yertgo?t=2073) bang theory for example the expanding  
[0:34:34](https://youtu.be/aliu6yertgo?t=2074) universe  
[0:34:35](https://youtu.be/aliu6yertgo?t=2075) look at what roger penrose was writing  
[0:34:37](https://youtu.be/aliu6yertgo?t=2077) 10 years ago about the  
[0:34:39](https://youtu.be/aliu6yertgo?t=2079) expanding universe and what he is  
[0:34:40](https://youtu.be/aliu6yertgo?t=2080) writing today there have been changes  
[0:34:42](https://youtu.be/aliu6yertgo?t=2082) because the data this is called theory  
[0:34:44](https://youtu.be/aliu6yertgo?t=2084) it's called undeterminism  
[0:34:46](https://youtu.be/aliu6yertgo?t=2086) ethio-relatedness where you describe the  
[0:34:49](https://youtu.be/aliu6yertgo?t=2089) data in different way you can interpret  
[0:34:50](https://youtu.be/aliu6yertgo?t=2090) in different ways  
[0:34:51](https://youtu.be/aliu6yertgo?t=2091) now we're saying when it comes to  
[0:34:53](https://youtu.be/aliu6yertgo?t=2093) historical fact  
[0:34:54](https://youtu.be/aliu6yertgo?t=2094) that the threshold of that being the  
[0:34:56](https://youtu.be/aliu6yertgo?t=2096) case is less because these are things  
[0:34:58](https://youtu.be/aliu6yertgo?t=2098) that have no  
[0:34:59](https://youtu.be/aliu6yertgo?t=2099) uh propensity to change so there is a  
[0:35:02](https://youtu.be/aliu6yertgo?t=2102) retrospective perspective which is  
[0:35:04](https://youtu.be/aliu6yertgo?t=2104) afforded to history or historical  
[0:35:05](https://youtu.be/aliu6yertgo?t=2105) enterprise  
[0:35:06](https://youtu.be/aliu6yertgo?t=2106) which unfortunately is not afforded to  
[0:35:09](https://youtu.be/aliu6yertgo?t=2109) the scientific enterprise  
[0:35:10](https://youtu.be/aliu6yertgo?t=2110) to give you to give you a very simple  
[0:35:12](https://youtu.be/aliu6yertgo?t=2112) example on that point well look 50 years  
[0:35:14](https://youtu.be/aliu6yertgo?t=2114) ago  
[0:35:15](https://youtu.be/aliu6yertgo?t=2115) 50 years ago is that history yes it's  
[0:35:16](https://youtu.be/aliu6yertgo?t=2116) history some historians would say 50  
[0:35:18](https://youtu.be/aliu6yertgo?t=2118) years ago is history  
[0:35:19](https://youtu.be/aliu6yertgo?t=2119) right so the holocaust i was sure okay  
[0:35:22](https://youtu.be/aliu6yertgo?t=2122) well there's some  
[0:35:23](https://youtu.be/aliu6yertgo?t=2123) speculation in the holocaust lies no  
[0:35:24](https://youtu.be/aliu6yertgo?t=2124) problem but some people are alive  
[0:35:27](https://youtu.be/aliu6yertgo?t=2127) and they have witnessed the second world  
[0:35:29](https://youtu.be/aliu6yertgo?t=2129) war they are still alive and they have  
[0:35:30](https://youtu.be/aliu6yertgo?t=2130) witnessed it  
[0:35:31](https://youtu.be/aliu6yertgo?t=2131) now the the basic question of how did  
[0:35:34](https://youtu.be/aliu6yertgo?t=2134) the second  
[0:35:34](https://youtu.be/aliu6yertgo?t=2134) world war happen that's a basic question  
[0:35:38](https://youtu.be/aliu6yertgo?t=2138) is that the answer to that question is  
[0:35:40](https://youtu.be/aliu6yertgo?t=2140) it and did it happen from the years 1939  
[0:35:42](https://youtu.be/aliu6yertgo?t=2142) to 1945  
[0:35:43](https://youtu.be/aliu6yertgo?t=2143) is the answer to that question more or  
[0:35:45](https://youtu.be/aliu6yertgo?t=2145) less likely to be falsified  
[0:35:46](https://youtu.be/aliu6yertgo?t=2146) than the question of is quantum  
[0:35:48](https://youtu.be/aliu6yertgo?t=2148) mechanics the copenhagen model  
[0:35:50](https://youtu.be/aliu6yertgo?t=2150) more likely or less likely to be  
[0:35:52](https://youtu.be/aliu6yertgo?t=2152) disproved in the future i think you know  
[0:35:53](https://youtu.be/aliu6yertgo?t=2153) the antenna  
[0:35:54](https://youtu.be/aliu6yertgo?t=2154) as well so in other words the  
[0:35:56](https://youtu.be/aliu6yertgo?t=2156) retrospective and the hindsight  
[0:35:57](https://youtu.be/aliu6yertgo?t=2157) perspective  
[0:35:58](https://youtu.be/aliu6yertgo?t=2158) gives more epistemic weight to the  
[0:36:01](https://youtu.be/aliu6yertgo?t=2161) historical enterprise  
[0:36:02](https://youtu.be/aliu6yertgo?t=2162) than it does to the scientific  
[0:36:04](https://youtu.be/aliu6yertgo?t=2164) enterprise and  
[0:36:05](https://youtu.be/aliu6yertgo?t=2165) because the scientific enterprise  
[0:36:06](https://youtu.be/aliu6yertgo?t=2166) according to clark popper and the most  
[0:36:08](https://youtu.be/aliu6yertgo?t=2168) recent  
[0:36:09](https://youtu.be/aliu6yertgo?t=2169) foster science discussions is based on  
[0:36:11](https://youtu.be/aliu6yertgo?t=2171) falsification  
[0:36:12](https://youtu.be/aliu6yertgo?t=2172) which is always going to be mean that is  
[0:36:14](https://youtu.be/aliu6yertgo?t=2174) that  
[0:36:15](https://youtu.be/aliu6yertgo?t=2175) it's incorrigible and there's some  
[0:36:16](https://youtu.be/aliu6yertgo?t=2176) susceptibility to change  
[0:36:18](https://youtu.be/aliu6yertgo?t=2178) whereas history though yes it's true  
[0:36:20](https://youtu.be/aliu6yertgo?t=2180) there's revisionist history  
[0:36:21](https://youtu.be/aliu6yertgo?t=2181) it's less likely and i'm using the word  
[0:36:23](https://youtu.be/aliu6yertgo?t=2183) carefully to do that especially on basic  
[0:36:25](https://youtu.be/aliu6yertgo?t=2185) matters  
[0:36:26](https://youtu.be/aliu6yertgo?t=2186) to do with events that took place the  
[0:36:28](https://youtu.be/aliu6yertgo?t=2188) more further back you go in history  
[0:36:29](https://youtu.be/aliu6yertgo?t=2189) the more vague it gets of course but we  
[0:36:31](https://youtu.be/aliu6yertgo?t=2191) have to now apply the critical methods  
[0:36:34](https://youtu.be/aliu6yertgo?t=2194) which historians use anyway and and  
[0:36:36](https://youtu.be/aliu6yertgo?t=2196) argue on the basis of probability  
[0:36:38](https://youtu.be/aliu6yertgo?t=2198) so it's never been about well this  
[0:36:41](https://youtu.be/aliu6yertgo?t=2201) we're not using induction at all because  
[0:36:42](https://youtu.be/aliu6yertgo?t=2202) we think induction is not certain  
[0:36:45](https://youtu.be/aliu6yertgo?t=2205) we don't say that we use induction but  
[0:36:47](https://youtu.be/aliu6yertgo?t=2207) we use it  
[0:36:48](https://youtu.be/aliu6yertgo?t=2208) uh as a matter of uh to to to assert a  
[0:36:52](https://youtu.be/aliu6yertgo?t=2212) probabilistic reasoning  
[0:36:53](https://youtu.be/aliu6yertgo?t=2213) and the higher the probability when it  
[0:36:55](https://youtu.be/aliu6yertgo?t=2215) goes over a certain number then quite  
[0:36:57](https://youtu.be/aliu6yertgo?t=2217) frankly we're not going to reject it we  
[0:36:58](https://youtu.be/aliu6yertgo?t=2218) say that  
[0:36:58](https://youtu.be/aliu6yertgo?t=2218) and that's why by the way and the  
[0:37:00](https://youtu.be/aliu6yertgo?t=2220) evidence of the quran is allah says  
[0:37:05](https://youtu.be/aliu6yertgo?t=2225) you will see it with the eye of yakim  
[0:37:09](https://youtu.be/aliu6yertgo?t=2229) so how if if seeing is empiricism and  
[0:37:12](https://youtu.be/aliu6yertgo?t=2232) empiricism is always going to be  
[0:37:13](https://youtu.be/aliu6yertgo?t=2233) somewhat inductive  
[0:37:14](https://youtu.be/aliu6yertgo?t=2234) because you're not going to see  
[0:37:15](https://youtu.be/aliu6yertgo?t=2235) everything then allah is basically  
[0:37:17](https://youtu.be/aliu6yertgo?t=2237) telling us  
[0:37:18](https://youtu.be/aliu6yertgo?t=2238) the reality of this human condition is  
[0:37:20](https://youtu.be/aliu6yertgo?t=2240) that if you see something  
[0:37:22](https://youtu.be/aliu6yertgo?t=2242) visually and you experience something  
[0:37:24](https://youtu.be/aliu6yertgo?t=2244) then really  
[0:37:26](https://youtu.be/aliu6yertgo?t=2246) the psychological human being you will  
[0:37:27](https://youtu.be/aliu6yertgo?t=2247) believe in it and so therefore  
[0:37:29](https://youtu.be/aliu6yertgo?t=2249) we don't reject them through our  
[0:37:31](https://youtu.be/aliu6yertgo?t=2251) induction no we just say that we  
[0:37:33](https://youtu.be/aliu6yertgo?t=2253) there's a certain threshold that  
[0:37:34](https://youtu.be/aliu6yertgo?t=2254) unfortunately a lot of science does not  
[0:37:36](https://youtu.be/aliu6yertgo?t=2256) know  
[0:37:36](https://youtu.be/aliu6yertgo?t=2256) and history can do really brilliant  
[0:37:39](https://youtu.be/aliu6yertgo?t=2259) brilliant answer and  
[0:37:40](https://youtu.be/aliu6yertgo?t=2260) i really like the way that uh hijab  
[0:37:43](https://youtu.be/aliu6yertgo?t=2263) first explained about  
[0:37:46](https://youtu.be/aliu6yertgo?t=2266) when people make this straw man argument  
[0:37:49](https://youtu.be/aliu6yertgo?t=2269) and some atheists do this that we don't  
[0:37:51](https://youtu.be/aliu6yertgo?t=2271) use science at all to verify the quran  
[0:37:54](https://youtu.be/aliu6yertgo?t=2274) actually no the whole argument is that  
[0:37:57](https://youtu.be/aliu6yertgo?t=2277) the way it was done previously is false  
[0:37:59](https://youtu.be/aliu6yertgo?t=2279) if they are for example intermittent  
[0:38:01](https://youtu.be/aliu6yertgo?t=2281) fasting right  
[0:38:03](https://youtu.be/aliu6yertgo?t=2283) why shouldn't we talk about the fact  
[0:38:05](https://youtu.be/aliu6yertgo?t=2285) that you know this type of fasting  
[0:38:07](https://youtu.be/aliu6yertgo?t=2287) is now being recommended by doctors  
[0:38:09](https://youtu.be/aliu6yertgo?t=2289) twice a week interestingly enough right  
[0:38:12](https://youtu.be/aliu6yertgo?t=2292) and you know the whole um  
[0:38:15](https://youtu.be/aliu6yertgo?t=2295) uh prophetic way of eating when you're  
[0:38:17](https://youtu.be/aliu6yertgo?t=2297) hungry as opposed to just  
[0:38:19](https://youtu.be/aliu6yertgo?t=2299) eating in a uh so whenever you you feel  
[0:38:22](https://youtu.be/aliu6yertgo?t=2302) like  
[0:38:23](https://youtu.be/aliu6yertgo?t=2303) even you know the ambrosia thing like  
[0:38:24](https://youtu.be/aliu6yertgo?t=2304) you know one hadith which sticks out  
[0:38:26](https://youtu.be/aliu6yertgo?t=2306) which has not been used that much in  
[0:38:27](https://youtu.be/aliu6yertgo?t=2307) science i don't even know why not  
[0:38:28](https://youtu.be/aliu6yertgo?t=2308) less that  
[0:38:32](https://youtu.be/aliu6yertgo?t=2312) the born child is not from the entirety  
[0:38:34](https://youtu.be/aliu6yertgo?t=2314) of the the into the the the fluid  
[0:38:37](https://youtu.be/aliu6yertgo?t=2317) what what a simple thing we know it's  
[0:38:41](https://youtu.be/aliu6yertgo?t=2321) not  
[0:38:42](https://youtu.be/aliu6yertgo?t=2322) which means there is genetic  
[0:38:45](https://youtu.be/aliu6yertgo?t=2325) contribution for the man and the woman  
[0:38:46](https://youtu.be/aliu6yertgo?t=2326) yeah  
[0:38:47](https://youtu.be/aliu6yertgo?t=2327) so we know already that it's not farming  
[0:38:49](https://youtu.be/aliu6yertgo?t=2329) and then we know now it's not from the  
[0:38:50](https://youtu.be/aliu6yertgo?t=2330) whole thing is  
[0:38:51](https://youtu.be/aliu6yertgo?t=2331) it's part of that yeah so these are very  
[0:38:54](https://youtu.be/aliu6yertgo?t=2334) very important things i think that  
[0:38:56](https://youtu.be/aliu6yertgo?t=2336) i think that hadith and that thing is a  
[0:38:58](https://youtu.be/aliu6yertgo?t=2338) very powerful argument for islam being  
[0:39:00](https://youtu.be/aliu6yertgo?t=2340) true absolutely honestly absolutely and  
[0:39:01](https://youtu.be/aliu6yertgo?t=2341) another point i think which is worth  
[0:39:03](https://youtu.be/aliu6yertgo?t=2343) uh repeating is  
[0:39:06](https://youtu.be/aliu6yertgo?t=2346) that we don't make a hasty  
[0:39:10](https://youtu.be/aliu6yertgo?t=2350) generalization of the epistemic way of  
[0:39:12](https://youtu.be/aliu6yertgo?t=2352) all of science so we don't say  
[0:39:15](https://youtu.be/aliu6yertgo?t=2355) um water being h2o is as  
[0:39:19](https://youtu.be/aliu6yertgo?t=2359) uh in flux as string theory that's again  
[0:39:21](https://youtu.be/aliu6yertgo?t=2361) another straw man because  
[0:39:23](https://youtu.be/aliu6yertgo?t=2363) what it is is what the the issues which  
[0:39:26](https://youtu.be/aliu6yertgo?t=2366) contradict the quran the scientific  
[0:39:29](https://youtu.be/aliu6yertgo?t=2369) theory which contradict the quran  
[0:39:31](https://youtu.be/aliu6yertgo?t=2371) you will find that they'll always be  
[0:39:33](https://youtu.be/aliu6yertgo?t=2373) about these grand paradigm  
[0:39:35](https://youtu.be/aliu6yertgo?t=2375) ideas which are susceptible to as as  
[0:39:40](https://youtu.be/aliu6yertgo?t=2380) muhammad said theory-ladenness  
[0:39:43](https://youtu.be/aliu6yertgo?t=2383) under-determination problem of  
[0:39:44](https://youtu.be/aliu6yertgo?t=2384) unconceived  
[0:39:45](https://youtu.be/aliu6yertgo?t=2385) alternatives um you know problem  
[0:39:48](https://youtu.be/aliu6yertgo?t=2388) induction  
[0:39:48](https://youtu.be/aliu6yertgo?t=2388) uh methodological naturalism restriction  
[0:39:51](https://youtu.be/aliu6yertgo?t=2391) restricting the answers which are  
[0:39:52](https://youtu.be/aliu6yertgo?t=2392) possible but when it comes to  
[0:39:54](https://youtu.be/aliu6yertgo?t=2394) the everyday practical science and i  
[0:39:56](https://youtu.be/aliu6yertgo?t=2396) think this is super important  
[0:39:58](https://youtu.be/aliu6yertgo?t=2398) you will not really find something in  
[0:39:59](https://youtu.be/aliu6yertgo?t=2399) the quranic discourse which goes against  
[0:40:02](https://youtu.be/aliu6yertgo?t=2402) that  
[0:40:02](https://youtu.be/aliu6yertgo?t=2402) and another thing to keep in mind is  
[0:40:05](https://youtu.be/aliu6yertgo?t=2405) that  
[0:40:06](https://youtu.be/aliu6yertgo?t=2406) when it comes down to these type of  
[0:40:08](https://youtu.be/aliu6yertgo?t=2408) ideas they say something like in quantum  
[0:40:10](https://youtu.be/aliu6yertgo?t=2410) mechanics you have the copernican  
[0:40:11](https://youtu.be/aliu6yertgo?t=2411) interpretation or many worlds  
[0:40:12](https://youtu.be/aliu6yertgo?t=2412) interpretation of these types of  
[0:40:14](https://youtu.be/aliu6yertgo?t=2414) interpretations  
[0:40:15](https://youtu.be/aliu6yertgo?t=2415) those things you'll never find something  
[0:40:18](https://youtu.be/aliu6yertgo?t=2418) solid there  
[0:40:19](https://youtu.be/aliu6yertgo?t=2419) that they can use to try and challenge  
[0:40:22](https://youtu.be/aliu6yertgo?t=2422) the quran  
[0:40:22](https://youtu.be/aliu6yertgo?t=2422) because you know those things are in  
[0:40:24](https://youtu.be/aliu6yertgo?t=2424) flux the other thing  
[0:40:26](https://youtu.be/aliu6yertgo?t=2426) uh distinction which was being made  
[0:40:28](https://youtu.be/aliu6yertgo?t=2428) about history  
[0:40:29](https://youtu.be/aliu6yertgo?t=2429) and um about science i i think is very  
[0:40:33](https://youtu.be/aliu6yertgo?t=2433) important which is that  
[0:40:34](https://youtu.be/aliu6yertgo?t=2434) the types of science which  
[0:40:38](https://youtu.be/aliu6yertgo?t=2438) are retrospective are more likely  
[0:40:42](https://youtu.be/aliu6yertgo?t=2442) to use history in their results and the  
[0:40:44](https://youtu.be/aliu6yertgo?t=2444) reason why is because  
[0:40:46](https://youtu.be/aliu6yertgo?t=2446) obviously it's a past event we're not  
[0:40:48](https://youtu.be/aliu6yertgo?t=2448) talking about future events  
[0:40:50](https://youtu.be/aliu6yertgo?t=2450) future events are much more likely to be  
[0:40:52](https://youtu.be/aliu6yertgo?t=2452) susceptible to  
[0:40:53](https://youtu.be/aliu6yertgo?t=2453) the problem of induction in terms of  
[0:40:54](https://youtu.be/aliu6yertgo?t=2454) your data collection however  
[0:40:57](https://youtu.be/aliu6yertgo?t=2457) what this uh atheist was referring to  
[0:40:59](https://youtu.be/aliu6yertgo?t=2459) when they were  
[0:41:00](https://youtu.be/aliu6yertgo?t=2460) challenging you in this was not to do  
[0:41:02](https://youtu.be/aliu6yertgo?t=2462) with problem  
[0:41:03](https://youtu.be/aliu6yertgo?t=2463) induction being applied to observations  
[0:41:05](https://youtu.be/aliu6yertgo?t=2465) the problem of induction being applied  
[0:41:07](https://youtu.be/aliu6yertgo?t=2467) to interpretations  
[0:41:09](https://youtu.be/aliu6yertgo?t=2469) okay now this is a very important  
[0:41:11](https://youtu.be/aliu6yertgo?t=2471) distinction one's observations one's  
[0:41:13](https://youtu.be/aliu6yertgo?t=2473) interpretations however  
[0:41:15](https://youtu.be/aliu6yertgo?t=2475) his here's a very subtle important point  
[0:41:18](https://youtu.be/aliu6yertgo?t=2478) the interpretation has a particular  
[0:41:21](https://youtu.be/aliu6yertgo?t=2481) paradigm  
[0:41:22](https://youtu.be/aliu6yertgo?t=2482) within which you have um a different  
[0:41:25](https://youtu.be/aliu6yertgo?t=2485) range of results so for example  
[0:41:28](https://youtu.be/aliu6yertgo?t=2488) historically  
[0:41:29](https://youtu.be/aliu6yertgo?t=2489) we know napoleon fought in waterloo we  
[0:41:33](https://youtu.be/aliu6yertgo?t=2493) know that  
[0:41:33](https://youtu.be/aliu6yertgo?t=2493) now historians can revise  
[0:41:36](https://youtu.be/aliu6yertgo?t=2496) okay did you use this strategy okay this  
[0:41:38](https://youtu.be/aliu6yertgo?t=2498) guy's personal account we found out as a  
[0:41:40](https://youtu.be/aliu6yertgo?t=2500) forgery  
[0:41:41](https://youtu.be/aliu6yertgo?t=2501) but you won't actually change the  
[0:41:42](https://youtu.be/aliu6yertgo?t=2502) fundamentals because that's a historical  
[0:41:45](https://youtu.be/aliu6yertgo?t=2505) fact  
[0:41:45](https://youtu.be/aliu6yertgo?t=2505) which you know certain things are  
[0:41:47](https://youtu.be/aliu6yertgo?t=2507) immutable like the the battle itself and  
[0:41:49](https://youtu.be/aliu6yertgo?t=2509) you know who won and who didn't but the  
[0:41:51](https://youtu.be/aliu6yertgo?t=2511) interpretations can change  
[0:41:53](https://youtu.be/aliu6yertgo?t=2513) but with science those things are much  
[0:41:56](https://youtu.be/aliu6yertgo?t=2516) um  
[0:41:57](https://youtu.be/aliu6yertgo?t=2517) much more broader so malleable exactly  
[0:42:01](https://youtu.be/aliu6yertgo?t=2521) so whenever people try and use this um  
[0:42:03](https://youtu.be/aliu6yertgo?t=2523) argument  
[0:42:04](https://youtu.be/aliu6yertgo?t=2524) to uh challenge uh you know our approach  
[0:42:09](https://youtu.be/aliu6yertgo?t=2529) they are basically misusing  
[0:42:12](https://youtu.be/aliu6yertgo?t=2532) the fact that most people don't think  
[0:42:14](https://youtu.be/aliu6yertgo?t=2534) about these things in a deep  
[0:42:16](https://youtu.be/aliu6yertgo?t=2536) way and initially it sounds quite  
[0:42:17](https://youtu.be/aliu6yertgo?t=2537) plausible oh but history's like this  
[0:42:19](https://youtu.be/aliu6yertgo?t=2539) history is his induction science is  
[0:42:21](https://youtu.be/aliu6yertgo?t=2541) induction  
[0:42:22](https://youtu.be/aliu6yertgo?t=2542) therefore you know this and that's the  
[0:42:24](https://youtu.be/aliu6yertgo?t=2544) danger of having a little bit of  
[0:42:25](https://youtu.be/aliu6yertgo?t=2545) knowledge  
[0:42:26](https://youtu.be/aliu6yertgo?t=2546) that's right that that's uh because  
[0:42:27](https://youtu.be/aliu6yertgo?t=2547) they're unable to they're unable to like  
[0:42:29](https://youtu.be/aliu6yertgo?t=2549) they've got these  
[0:42:30](https://youtu.be/aliu6yertgo?t=2550) uh ideas but they're unable to  
[0:42:32](https://youtu.be/aliu6yertgo?t=2552) critically kind of delineate  
[0:42:34](https://youtu.be/aliu6yertgo?t=2554) like for instance you were just saying  
[0:42:35](https://youtu.be/aliu6yertgo?t=2555) something interesting because i reminded  
[0:42:37](https://youtu.be/aliu6yertgo?t=2557) me actually of what richard dawkins  
[0:42:38](https://youtu.be/aliu6yertgo?t=2558) himself said  
[0:42:39](https://youtu.be/aliu6yertgo?t=2559) he was talking about the theory of  
[0:42:40](https://youtu.be/aliu6yertgo?t=2560) evolution and i don't know if that was  
[0:42:42](https://youtu.be/aliu6yertgo?t=2562) in his discussion with him  
[0:42:43](https://youtu.be/aliu6yertgo?t=2563) actually in the streets when when he  
[0:42:45](https://youtu.be/aliu6yertgo?t=2565) results was  
[0:42:47](https://youtu.be/aliu6yertgo?t=2567) was dominating him but was was before  
[0:42:49](https://youtu.be/aliu6yertgo?t=2569) that when he said like well actually  
[0:42:51](https://youtu.be/aliu6yertgo?t=2571) um some of the effect of um  
[0:42:55](https://youtu.be/aliu6yertgo?t=2575) theory evolution is like a murder case  
[0:42:58](https://youtu.be/aliu6yertgo?t=2578) yes  
[0:42:58](https://youtu.be/aliu6yertgo?t=2578) yes and he said that we have to look at  
[0:43:00](https://youtu.be/aliu6yertgo?t=2580) the clues and we have to look at and we  
[0:43:01](https://youtu.be/aliu6yertgo?t=2581) have to make our decision as to what  
[0:43:03](https://youtu.be/aliu6yertgo?t=2583) happened right  
[0:43:04](https://youtu.be/aliu6yertgo?t=2584) and i think he said it perfectly  
[0:43:05](https://youtu.be/aliu6yertgo?t=2585) actually and that in that analogy  
[0:43:07](https://youtu.be/aliu6yertgo?t=2587) is like a murder case but as we know  
[0:43:10](https://youtu.be/aliu6yertgo?t=2590) from  
[0:43:10](https://youtu.be/aliu6yertgo?t=2590) miscarriages of justice cold cases all  
[0:43:13](https://youtu.be/aliu6yertgo?t=2593) these kind of things which  
[0:43:14](https://youtu.be/aliu6yertgo?t=2594) revived we know that actually  
[0:43:17](https://youtu.be/aliu6yertgo?t=2597) you can get it fundamentally wrong when  
[0:43:19](https://youtu.be/aliu6yertgo?t=2599) you're trying to interpret the data  
[0:43:21](https://youtu.be/aliu6yertgo?t=2601) and what we're saying is we know that  
[0:43:22](https://youtu.be/aliu6yertgo?t=2602) there are fossils we know that there are  
[0:43:24](https://youtu.be/aliu6yertgo?t=2604) similarities between creatures  
[0:43:26](https://youtu.be/aliu6yertgo?t=2606) anatomically we know those things how do  
[0:43:28](https://youtu.be/aliu6yertgo?t=2608) you interpret them how do you interpret  
[0:43:30](https://youtu.be/aliu6yertgo?t=2610) what happened here  
[0:43:31](https://youtu.be/aliu6yertgo?t=2611) so then your lamar king will say  
[0:43:32](https://youtu.be/aliu6yertgo?t=2612) something the genetic bias  
[0:43:34](https://youtu.be/aliu6yertgo?t=2614) mutationism yeah mutationism what's the  
[0:43:36](https://youtu.be/aliu6yertgo?t=2616) other one genetic engineering  
[0:43:38](https://youtu.be/aliu6yertgo?t=2618) yeah natural genetic engineering natural  
[0:43:40](https://youtu.be/aliu6yertgo?t=2620) genetic engineering all of them will  
[0:43:41](https://youtu.be/aliu6yertgo?t=2621) have their spin on it  
[0:43:42](https://youtu.be/aliu6yertgo?t=2622) like okay and the new darwinian will say  
[0:43:44](https://youtu.be/aliu6yertgo?t=2624) whatever you they all have their own  
[0:43:46](https://youtu.be/aliu6yertgo?t=2626) interpretation so they're making their  
[0:43:47](https://youtu.be/aliu6yertgo?t=2627) own narrative they're making their own  
[0:43:48](https://youtu.be/aliu6yertgo?t=2628) stories bro  
[0:43:49](https://youtu.be/aliu6yertgo?t=2629) like you told me something really  
[0:43:50](https://youtu.be/aliu6yertgo?t=2630) interesting one time before you were  
[0:43:52](https://youtu.be/aliu6yertgo?t=2632) telling me  
[0:43:52](https://youtu.be/aliu6yertgo?t=2632) what's referred to as just sort of  
[0:43:53](https://youtu.be/aliu6yertgo?t=2633) stories you know yeah yeah and that  
[0:43:55](https://youtu.be/aliu6yertgo?t=2635) stuck in my mind it really it was a good  
[0:43:56](https://youtu.be/aliu6yertgo?t=2636) thing maybe i want to explain to the  
[0:43:58](https://youtu.be/aliu6yertgo?t=2638) people so  
[0:43:58](https://youtu.be/aliu6yertgo?t=2638) you know just those stories is obviously  
[0:44:01](https://youtu.be/aliu6yertgo?t=2641) rudyard kipling's book  
[0:44:03](https://youtu.be/aliu6yertgo?t=2643) in which you know how did the zebra get  
[0:44:05](https://youtu.be/aliu6yertgo?t=2645) its  
[0:44:06](https://youtu.be/aliu6yertgo?t=2646) stripes how did the elephant get a long  
[0:44:08](https://youtu.be/aliu6yertgo?t=2648) trunk and they have all these stories  
[0:44:09](https://youtu.be/aliu6yertgo?t=2649) that the crocodile was dragging the  
[0:44:11](https://youtu.be/aliu6yertgo?t=2651) uh elephant and you know it kept getting  
[0:44:13](https://youtu.be/aliu6yertgo?t=2653) a long snout so this was actually a term  
[0:44:17](https://youtu.be/aliu6yertgo?t=2657) used to describe the stories that  
[0:44:20](https://youtu.be/aliu6yertgo?t=2660) biologists were using to describe traits  
[0:44:23](https://youtu.be/aliu6yertgo?t=2663) that we have genetic anatomical traits  
[0:44:25](https://youtu.be/aliu6yertgo?t=2665) and how they actually evolved  
[0:44:26](https://youtu.be/aliu6yertgo?t=2666) because these were stories which i think  
[0:44:29](https://youtu.be/aliu6yertgo?t=2669) very important to understand  
[0:44:30](https://youtu.be/aliu6yertgo?t=2670) are coherent with natural selection  
[0:44:33](https://youtu.be/aliu6yertgo?t=2673) however they don't have any evidence  
[0:44:35](https://youtu.be/aliu6yertgo?t=2675) so is it like for example you were  
[0:44:36](https://youtu.be/aliu6yertgo?t=2676) giving an example before like why women  
[0:44:38](https://youtu.be/aliu6yertgo?t=2678) like pink might because they're cutting  
[0:44:39](https://youtu.be/aliu6yertgo?t=2679) the meat and they see the rest yeah yeah  
[0:44:40](https://youtu.be/aliu6yertgo?t=2680) yeah exactly so the steven j gould and  
[0:44:44](https://youtu.be/aliu6yertgo?t=2684) men love blue because they look in the  
[0:44:45](https://youtu.be/aliu6yertgo?t=2685) sky when they're hunting  
[0:44:46](https://youtu.be/aliu6yertgo?t=2686) um can you get me that book that really  
[0:44:49](https://youtu.be/aliu6yertgo?t=2689) big one over there please  
[0:44:51](https://youtu.be/aliu6yertgo?t=2691) so um stephen j gould and richard  
[0:44:54](https://youtu.be/aliu6yertgo?t=2694) lewinton they were both  
[0:44:56](https://youtu.be/aliu6yertgo?t=2696) uh biologists from um harvard  
[0:45:00](https://youtu.be/aliu6yertgo?t=2700) they basically um came up with this term  
[0:45:03](https://youtu.be/aliu6yertgo?t=2703) just so stories  
[0:45:04](https://youtu.be/aliu6yertgo?t=2704) because what they found was that there's  
[0:45:06](https://youtu.be/aliu6yertgo?t=2706) lots of stories being given  
[0:45:08](https://youtu.be/aliu6yertgo?t=2708) but they didn't have any evidence but  
[0:45:10](https://youtu.be/aliu6yertgo?t=2710) they were plausible stories so for  
[0:45:11](https://youtu.be/aliu6yertgo?t=2711) example  
[0:45:13](https://youtu.be/aliu6yertgo?t=2713) you come home one day and you find a  
[0:45:15](https://youtu.be/aliu6yertgo?t=2715) letter you find a letter  
[0:45:17](https://youtu.be/aliu6yertgo?t=2717) uh which has your name on it and you can  
[0:45:20](https://youtu.be/aliu6yertgo?t=2720) see that  
[0:45:21](https://youtu.be/aliu6yertgo?t=2721) you know it's come from the gas bill or  
[0:45:22](https://youtu.be/aliu6yertgo?t=2722) whatever now one  
[0:45:24](https://youtu.be/aliu6yertgo?t=2724) proposition is that the postman came and  
[0:45:26](https://youtu.be/aliu6yertgo?t=2726) they actually put the letter in  
[0:45:29](https://youtu.be/aliu6yertgo?t=2729) another proposition is that the postman  
[0:45:31](https://youtu.be/aliu6yertgo?t=2731) came  
[0:45:32](https://youtu.be/aliu6yertgo?t=2732) and they delivered it to somebody at the  
[0:45:34](https://youtu.be/aliu6yertgo?t=2734) top of the street and that person picked  
[0:45:36](https://youtu.be/aliu6yertgo?t=2736) it up  
[0:45:36](https://youtu.be/aliu6yertgo?t=2736) and then they went all the way down to  
[0:45:38](https://youtu.be/aliu6yertgo?t=2738) your house and they put it in and you  
[0:45:39](https://youtu.be/aliu6yertgo?t=2739) thought it was the postman when it was  
[0:45:41](https://youtu.be/aliu6yertgo?t=2741) actually  
[0:45:42](https://youtu.be/aliu6yertgo?t=2742) this another possibility is the postman  
[0:45:45](https://youtu.be/aliu6yertgo?t=2745) delivered it to house number two  
[0:45:46](https://youtu.be/aliu6yertgo?t=2746) but then that person came to you so now  
[0:45:48](https://youtu.be/aliu6yertgo?t=2748) you've got an infinite number the fact  
[0:45:49](https://youtu.be/aliu6yertgo?t=2749) is  
[0:45:50](https://youtu.be/aliu6yertgo?t=2750) each one of these stories is coherent  
[0:45:53](https://youtu.be/aliu6yertgo?t=2753) doesn't mean there's any evidence for it  
[0:45:56](https://youtu.be/aliu6yertgo?t=2756) so  
[0:45:56](https://youtu.be/aliu6yertgo?t=2756) what these guys were saying was that  
[0:45:58](https://youtu.be/aliu6yertgo?t=2758) there are a lot of stories being given  
[0:46:00](https://youtu.be/aliu6yertgo?t=2760) which are coherent but the stories don't  
[0:46:02](https://youtu.be/aliu6yertgo?t=2762) have any evidence now  
[0:46:04](https://youtu.be/aliu6yertgo?t=2764) when you look at something like this  
[0:46:05](https://youtu.be/aliu6yertgo?t=2765) like evolution the first uh  
[0:46:08](https://youtu.be/aliu6yertgo?t=2768) four billion years this is uh mike uh  
[0:46:10](https://youtu.be/aliu6yertgo?t=2770) sorry michael roos and  
[0:46:11](https://youtu.be/aliu6yertgo?t=2771) uh eo wilson and all the rest you'll  
[0:46:14](https://youtu.be/aliu6yertgo?t=2774) find actually  
[0:46:15](https://youtu.be/aliu6yertgo?t=2775) any any particular thing how do how is  
[0:46:18](https://youtu.be/aliu6yertgo?t=2778) it that human beings  
[0:46:19](https://youtu.be/aliu6yertgo?t=2779) like uh uh have a certain  
[0:46:23](https://youtu.be/aliu6yertgo?t=2783) preference for colors so they'll say  
[0:46:25](https://youtu.be/aliu6yertgo?t=2785) okay we'll have this certain preference  
[0:46:27](https://youtu.be/aliu6yertgo?t=2787) for colors because  
[0:46:28](https://youtu.be/aliu6yertgo?t=2788) back in the time when we were  
[0:46:28](https://youtu.be/aliu6yertgo?t=2788) hunter-gatherers men  
[0:46:31](https://youtu.be/aliu6yertgo?t=2791) who were more predisposed to like the  
[0:46:32](https://youtu.be/aliu6yertgo?t=2792) color blue because the sky is blue  
[0:46:34](https://youtu.be/aliu6yertgo?t=2794) because the watering hole is blue are  
[0:46:36](https://youtu.be/aliu6yertgo?t=2796) more likely to survive  
[0:46:37](https://youtu.be/aliu6yertgo?t=2797) and you know you you'll get literally  
[0:46:39](https://youtu.be/aliu6yertgo?t=2799) volumes of these types of stories which  
[0:46:41](https://youtu.be/aliu6yertgo?t=2801) you'll find in all types of evolutionary  
[0:46:42](https://youtu.be/aliu6yertgo?t=2802) books  
[0:46:43](https://youtu.be/aliu6yertgo?t=2803) however the problem is they are equally  
[0:46:46](https://youtu.be/aliu6yertgo?t=2806) plausible  
[0:46:47](https://youtu.be/aliu6yertgo?t=2807) alternatives just like the postman n  
[0:46:50](https://youtu.be/aliu6yertgo?t=2810) plus one  
[0:46:51](https://youtu.be/aliu6yertgo?t=2811) yeah but none of them can be adjudicated  
[0:46:54](https://youtu.be/aliu6yertgo?t=2814) hence why they are pure just soul  
[0:46:56](https://youtu.be/aliu6yertgo?t=2816) stories now  
[0:46:57](https://youtu.be/aliu6yertgo?t=2817) this doesn't mean that one of them is  
[0:47:00](https://youtu.be/aliu6yertgo?t=2820) not true  
[0:47:01](https://youtu.be/aliu6yertgo?t=2821) because you know the idea that the  
[0:47:02](https://youtu.be/aliu6yertgo?t=2822) postman delivered to your door  
[0:47:05](https://youtu.be/aliu6yertgo?t=2825) is way more likely than somebody  
[0:47:08](https://youtu.be/aliu6yertgo?t=2828) accidentally gave it to the top of the  
[0:47:10](https://youtu.be/aliu6yertgo?t=2830) street and then  
[0:47:10](https://youtu.be/aliu6yertgo?t=2830) it came to you however so there is one  
[0:47:14](https://youtu.be/aliu6yertgo?t=2834) right answer and there's possibly uh  
[0:47:16](https://youtu.be/aliu6yertgo?t=2836) you know many many wrong answers but  
[0:47:18](https://youtu.be/aliu6yertgo?t=2838) what's super important  
[0:47:19](https://youtu.be/aliu6yertgo?t=2839) is that for the vast majority of people  
[0:47:22](https://youtu.be/aliu6yertgo?t=2842) because they're very  
[0:47:23](https://youtu.be/aliu6yertgo?t=2843) simple a coherent story  
[0:47:26](https://youtu.be/aliu6yertgo?t=2846) they will interpret as evidence and  
[0:47:29](https://youtu.be/aliu6yertgo?t=2849) that's why the just so story  
[0:47:31](https://youtu.be/aliu6yertgo?t=2851) uh term was so popular that  
[0:47:34](https://youtu.be/aliu6yertgo?t=2854) now today is actually becoming into an  
[0:47:36](https://youtu.be/aliu6yertgo?t=2856) academic term yes  
[0:47:38](https://youtu.be/aliu6yertgo?t=2858) it's actually referred to in journals in  
[0:47:40](https://youtu.be/aliu6yertgo?t=2860) books and lectures  
[0:47:41](https://youtu.be/aliu6yertgo?t=2861) yeah just so stories is now an academic  
[0:47:44](https://youtu.be/aliu6yertgo?t=2864) term initially it was a  
[0:47:46](https://youtu.be/aliu6yertgo?t=2866) ridicule of the dominance position right  
[0:47:48](https://youtu.be/aliu6yertgo?t=2868) but now it's it's evolved  
[0:47:49](https://youtu.be/aliu6yertgo?t=2869) so you're well in summary therefore  
[0:47:50](https://youtu.be/aliu6yertgo?t=2870) you're saying is uh  
[0:47:52](https://youtu.be/aliu6yertgo?t=2872) actually you know it is a difference  
[0:47:55](https://youtu.be/aliu6yertgo?t=2875) between  
[0:47:55](https://youtu.be/aliu6yertgo?t=2875) the observable number one and that  
[0:47:58](https://youtu.be/aliu6yertgo?t=2878) and the interpretation of the observable  
[0:48:00](https://youtu.be/aliu6yertgo?t=2880) and the interpretation of the observable  
[0:48:02](https://youtu.be/aliu6yertgo?t=2882) is subject or susceptible to a variety  
[0:48:05](https://youtu.be/aliu6yertgo?t=2885) of different interpretations  
[0:48:06](https://youtu.be/aliu6yertgo?t=2886) and this is the problem of  
[0:48:07](https://youtu.be/aliu6yertgo?t=2887) undetermination yeah and  
[0:48:09](https://youtu.be/aliu6yertgo?t=2889) each interpretation would you say that  
[0:48:10](https://youtu.be/aliu6yertgo?t=2890) correct yeah yeah  
[0:48:12](https://youtu.be/aliu6yertgo?t=2892) yeah under determination except that  
[0:48:15](https://youtu.be/aliu6yertgo?t=2895) each particular story is  
[0:48:19](https://youtu.be/aliu6yertgo?t=2899) internally consistent yes and  
[0:48:22](https://youtu.be/aliu6yertgo?t=2902) people mistake internal consistency for  
[0:48:24](https://youtu.be/aliu6yertgo?t=2904) evidence  
[0:48:25](https://youtu.be/aliu6yertgo?t=2905) because let's say you go to a police  
[0:48:27](https://youtu.be/aliu6yertgo?t=2907) right uh  
[0:48:28](https://youtu.be/aliu6yertgo?t=2908) somebody robbed you or you're being  
[0:48:30](https://youtu.be/aliu6yertgo?t=2910) accused of murder the police will try  
[0:48:32](https://youtu.be/aliu6yertgo?t=2912) and find inconsistencies if they find  
[0:48:34](https://youtu.be/aliu6yertgo?t=2914) that you're consistent it seems your  
[0:48:36](https://youtu.be/aliu6yertgo?t=2916) testimony has weight  
[0:48:37](https://youtu.be/aliu6yertgo?t=2917) so human beings normally associate  
[0:48:40](https://youtu.be/aliu6yertgo?t=2920) consistency  
[0:48:41](https://youtu.be/aliu6yertgo?t=2921) with truth but consistency could be just  
[0:48:44](https://youtu.be/aliu6yertgo?t=2924) a very consistent story  
[0:48:46](https://youtu.be/aliu6yertgo?t=2926) it's not necessary that that story is  
[0:48:49](https://youtu.be/aliu6yertgo?t=2929) true so  
[0:48:50](https://youtu.be/aliu6yertgo?t=2930) truth um requires consistency  
[0:48:54](https://youtu.be/aliu6yertgo?t=2934) as a necessary condition but not  
[0:48:56](https://youtu.be/aliu6yertgo?t=2936) sufficient  
[0:48:57](https://youtu.be/aliu6yertgo?t=2937) so yeah that's why it's true  
[0:49:02](https://youtu.be/aliu6yertgo?t=2942) because you mentioned from everything  
[0:49:04](https://youtu.be/aliu6yertgo?t=2944) i've gathered and it was very very  
[0:49:06](https://youtu.be/aliu6yertgo?t=2946) beneficial like i've actually not heard  
[0:49:08](https://youtu.be/aliu6yertgo?t=2948) the answer to this before  
[0:49:10](https://youtu.be/aliu6yertgo?t=2950) that for science it's very true that you  
[0:49:12](https://youtu.be/aliu6yertgo?t=2952) can't compare string theory to the fact  
[0:49:14](https://youtu.be/aliu6yertgo?t=2954) that we are men  
[0:49:15](https://youtu.be/aliu6yertgo?t=2955) female and have different chromosomes  
[0:49:16](https://youtu.be/aliu6yertgo?t=2956) right so do you have a sort of criteria  
[0:49:19](https://youtu.be/aliu6yertgo?t=2959) or have you  
[0:49:20](https://youtu.be/aliu6yertgo?t=2960) come up with a structure how do you say  
[0:49:23](https://youtu.be/aliu6yertgo?t=2963) it there is hold  
[0:49:25](https://youtu.be/aliu6yertgo?t=2965) on threshold yeah now you're right  
[0:49:28](https://youtu.be/aliu6yertgo?t=2968) you're right to ask that question  
[0:49:29](https://youtu.be/aliu6yertgo?t=2969) okay what is the threshold here's what i  
[0:49:32](https://youtu.be/aliu6yertgo?t=2972) would think  
[0:49:32](https://youtu.be/aliu6yertgo?t=2972) is the reasonable psychological  
[0:49:34](https://youtu.be/aliu6yertgo?t=2974) threshold it comes back to what you were  
[0:49:35](https://youtu.be/aliu6yertgo?t=2975) saying someone before about what we  
[0:49:38](https://youtu.be/aliu6yertgo?t=2978) what we expect in everyday life the  
[0:49:41](https://youtu.be/aliu6yertgo?t=2981) threshold we want  
[0:49:42](https://youtu.be/aliu6yertgo?t=2982) the atheist interlocutor or the skeptic  
[0:49:44](https://youtu.be/aliu6yertgo?t=2984) interlocutor to use  
[0:49:45](https://youtu.be/aliu6yertgo?t=2985) is the same exact threshold he uses in  
[0:49:47](https://youtu.be/aliu6yertgo?t=2987) his everyday life in decision making  
[0:49:50](https://youtu.be/aliu6yertgo?t=2990) we we are calling them out for having a  
[0:49:52](https://youtu.be/aliu6yertgo?t=2992) psychological double standard  
[0:49:54](https://youtu.be/aliu6yertgo?t=2994) we're exposing that double sign actually  
[0:49:56](https://youtu.be/aliu6yertgo?t=2996) epistemic justification comes very  
[0:49:58](https://youtu.be/aliu6yertgo?t=2998) naturally all right  
[0:50:00](https://youtu.be/aliu6yertgo?t=3000) you know you exist right now because  
[0:50:01](https://youtu.be/aliu6yertgo?t=3001) you're talking to me you know you you  
[0:50:03](https://youtu.be/aliu6yertgo?t=3003) might  
[0:50:04](https://youtu.be/aliu6yertgo?t=3004) have money in your pocket you might not  
[0:50:05](https://youtu.be/aliu6yertgo?t=3005) see it but you might feel it and that  
[0:50:07](https://youtu.be/aliu6yertgo?t=3007) for you is enough to determine that the  
[0:50:08](https://youtu.be/aliu6yertgo?t=3008) money is in your pocket  
[0:50:10](https://youtu.be/aliu6yertgo?t=3010) you you might have books in your shelf  
[0:50:12](https://youtu.be/aliu6yertgo?t=3012) you've  
[0:50:13](https://youtu.be/aliu6yertgo?t=3013) you know the last time you saw them they  
[0:50:14](https://youtu.be/aliu6yertgo?t=3014) were there you might not have them there  
[0:50:16](https://youtu.be/aliu6yertgo?t=3016) anymore  
[0:50:17](https://youtu.be/aliu6yertgo?t=3017) but you're assuming that they are there  
[0:50:19](https://youtu.be/aliu6yertgo?t=3019) and that's an inference  
[0:50:20](https://youtu.be/aliu6yertgo?t=3020) these assumptions that we are making are  
[0:50:23](https://youtu.be/aliu6yertgo?t=3023) natural  
[0:50:23](https://youtu.be/aliu6yertgo?t=3023) and we don't even think twice about them  
[0:50:25](https://youtu.be/aliu6yertgo?t=3025) otherwise we would actually literally go  
[0:50:26](https://youtu.be/aliu6yertgo?t=3026) mad  
[0:50:27](https://youtu.be/aliu6yertgo?t=3027) a true skeptic is somebody who belongs  
[0:50:31](https://youtu.be/aliu6yertgo?t=3031) in the  
[0:50:31](https://youtu.be/aliu6yertgo?t=3031) in the mental institute by the way  
[0:50:33](https://youtu.be/aliu6yertgo?t=3033) someone who is skeptical about  
[0:50:35](https://youtu.be/aliu6yertgo?t=3035) everything that happens in their life  
[0:50:36](https://youtu.be/aliu6yertgo?t=3036) and they're not unsure  
[0:50:37](https://youtu.be/aliu6yertgo?t=3037) someone who lives that life is  
[0:50:39](https://youtu.be/aliu6yertgo?t=3039) psychologically unstable person  
[0:50:41](https://youtu.be/aliu6yertgo?t=3041) do you know that like a true skeptic on  
[0:50:44](https://youtu.be/aliu6yertgo?t=3044) every life decision would be  
[0:50:45](https://youtu.be/aliu6yertgo?t=3045) psychologically troubled  
[0:50:46](https://youtu.be/aliu6yertgo?t=3046) and you know what's very interesting  
[0:50:47](https://youtu.be/aliu6yertgo?t=3047) about this um when i was  
[0:50:50](https://youtu.be/aliu6yertgo?t=3050) at university and we were doing uh moral  
[0:50:53](https://youtu.be/aliu6yertgo?t=3053) philosophy  
[0:50:55](https://youtu.be/aliu6yertgo?t=3055) the professor mentions a point which  
[0:50:57](https://youtu.be/aliu6yertgo?t=3057) sounded  
[0:50:58](https://youtu.be/aliu6yertgo?t=3058) which was actually very profound but he  
[0:51:00](https://youtu.be/aliu6yertgo?t=3060) did it in a very mundane way right  
[0:51:02](https://youtu.be/aliu6yertgo?t=3062) what he basically said is the arguments  
[0:51:05](https://youtu.be/aliu6yertgo?t=3065) for moral skepticism  
[0:51:07](https://youtu.be/aliu6yertgo?t=3067) are the strongest in philosophy yet they  
[0:51:10](https://youtu.be/aliu6yertgo?t=3070) are rejected by the majority of  
[0:51:12](https://youtu.be/aliu6yertgo?t=3072) philosophers  
[0:51:13](https://youtu.be/aliu6yertgo?t=3073) even though their arguments haven't been  
[0:51:15](https://youtu.be/aliu6yertgo?t=3075) addressed  
[0:51:16](https://youtu.be/aliu6yertgo?t=3076) which shows that the philosophers  
[0:51:18](https://youtu.be/aliu6yertgo?t=3078) themselves are not really following  
[0:51:20](https://youtu.be/aliu6yertgo?t=3080) that philosophical skepticism they're  
[0:51:22](https://youtu.be/aliu6yertgo?t=3082) rather bophitri  
[0:51:23](https://youtu.be/aliu6yertgo?t=3083) they rather believe in some form of uh  
[0:51:26](https://youtu.be/aliu6yertgo?t=3086) moral objectivity  
[0:51:28](https://youtu.be/aliu6yertgo?t=3088) you'll talk about moral skepticism we  
[0:51:29](https://youtu.be/aliu6yertgo?t=3089) were talking about epistemic steps yeah  
[0:51:30](https://youtu.be/aliu6yertgo?t=3090) the reason why i was saying that is  
[0:51:32](https://youtu.be/aliu6yertgo?t=3092) because  
[0:51:33](https://youtu.be/aliu6yertgo?t=3093) uh skeptic skepticism whether it's moral  
[0:51:36](https://youtu.be/aliu6yertgo?t=3096) existential or whatever  
[0:51:38](https://youtu.be/aliu6yertgo?t=3098) it's always going to be an impractical  
[0:51:40](https://youtu.be/aliu6yertgo?t=3100) philosophy  
[0:51:41](https://youtu.be/aliu6yertgo?t=3101) so even with this case when they're  
[0:51:42](https://youtu.be/aliu6yertgo?t=3102) using this type of  
[0:51:44](https://youtu.be/aliu6yertgo?t=3104) skepticism and epistemology they will  
[0:51:47](https://youtu.be/aliu6yertgo?t=3107) not be able to be consistent with this  
[0:51:48](https://youtu.be/aliu6yertgo?t=3108) just like the  
[0:51:49](https://youtu.be/aliu6yertgo?t=3109) moral philosophers won't be able to be  
[0:51:51](https://youtu.be/aliu6yertgo?t=3111) consistent  
[0:51:52](https://youtu.be/aliu6yertgo?t=3112) in this regard because we always have to  
[0:51:55](https://youtu.be/aliu6yertgo?t=3115) ask this question  
[0:51:57](https://youtu.be/aliu6yertgo?t=3117) is this argument that the person is  
[0:51:59](https://youtu.be/aliu6yertgo?t=3119) using a double-edged sword  
[0:52:01](https://youtu.be/aliu6yertgo?t=3121) and if it's a double-edged sword just  
[0:52:03](https://youtu.be/aliu6yertgo?t=3123) show them is cutting you as well yes i  
[0:52:05](https://youtu.be/aliu6yertgo?t=3125) think that's the same thing with  
[0:52:06](https://youtu.be/aliu6yertgo?t=3126) post-modernism to be honest with you  
[0:52:07](https://youtu.be/aliu6yertgo?t=3127) because  
[0:52:07](https://youtu.be/aliu6yertgo?t=3127) it's the whole thing of how i understand  
[0:52:09](https://youtu.be/aliu6yertgo?t=3129) possible this is  
[0:52:11](https://youtu.be/aliu6yertgo?t=3131) deconstructing meta narratives gonna put  
[0:52:13](https://youtu.be/aliu6yertgo?t=3133) it in this yeah yeah yeah yeah good  
[0:52:14](https://youtu.be/aliu6yertgo?t=3134) that's our understanding you know so i  
[0:52:16](https://youtu.be/aliu6yertgo?t=3136) don't think many people understand what  
[0:52:17](https://youtu.be/aliu6yertgo?t=3137) postmodernism is  
[0:52:19](https://youtu.be/aliu6yertgo?t=3139) you know some people think it's marxism  
[0:52:20](https://youtu.be/aliu6yertgo?t=3140) it's not it's completely different  
[0:52:21](https://youtu.be/aliu6yertgo?t=3141) ideology right  
[0:52:23](https://youtu.be/aliu6yertgo?t=3143) and um anyway it's the same problem  
[0:52:25](https://youtu.be/aliu6yertgo?t=3145) because like  
[0:52:26](https://youtu.be/aliu6yertgo?t=3146) one of my refutations which has not been  
[0:52:28](https://youtu.be/aliu6yertgo?t=3148) given as much uh  
[0:52:30](https://youtu.be/aliu6yertgo?t=3150) exposure perhaps you know is uh when i  
[0:52:32](https://youtu.be/aliu6yertgo?t=3152) was refuting the third wave feminist and  
[0:52:34](https://youtu.be/aliu6yertgo?t=3154) judith butler in particular  
[0:52:35](https://youtu.be/aliu6yertgo?t=3155) and i found it and this actually started  
[0:52:37](https://youtu.be/aliu6yertgo?t=3157) off as an essay it got really high  
[0:52:38](https://youtu.be/aliu6yertgo?t=3158) grades  
[0:52:39](https://youtu.be/aliu6yertgo?t=3159) the woman was a transgender herself you  
[0:52:41](https://youtu.be/aliu6yertgo?t=3161) know  
[0:52:42](https://youtu.be/aliu6yertgo?t=3162) the cheering they were whatever you know  
[0:52:44](https://youtu.be/aliu6yertgo?t=3164) how she wants to  
[0:52:45](https://youtu.be/aliu6yertgo?t=3165) was the transgender what she recognized  
[0:52:47](https://youtu.be/aliu6yertgo?t=3167) the force of the argument i put it into  
[0:52:48](https://youtu.be/aliu6yertgo?t=3168) the book the fifth word feminist book  
[0:52:50](https://youtu.be/aliu6yertgo?t=3170) that i wrote  
[0:52:50](https://youtu.be/aliu6yertgo?t=3170) which is basically this it's like i was  
[0:52:53](https://youtu.be/aliu6yertgo?t=3173) reading what jesus butler was saying  
[0:52:54](https://youtu.be/aliu6yertgo?t=3174) saying that everything was a social  
[0:52:55](https://youtu.be/aliu6yertgo?t=3175) construct here  
[0:52:56](https://youtu.be/aliu6yertgo?t=3176) like race is a social consonant like she  
[0:52:58](https://youtu.be/aliu6yertgo?t=3178) doesn't say what but  
[0:53:00](https://youtu.be/aliu6yertgo?t=3180) biology things like biological [ __ ] i in  
[0:53:02](https://youtu.be/aliu6yertgo?t=3182) my reading she's saying that sex is a  
[0:53:04](https://youtu.be/aliu6yertgo?t=3184) social construct right and then what  
[0:53:06](https://youtu.be/aliu6yertgo?t=3186) this might sound like completely  
[0:53:08](https://youtu.be/aliu6yertgo?t=3188) peripheral or  
[0:53:09](https://youtu.be/aliu6yertgo?t=3189) a tangential potentially even not  
[0:53:11](https://youtu.be/aliu6yertgo?t=3191) related  
[0:53:12](https://youtu.be/aliu6yertgo?t=3192) but that's why i read in what she was  
[0:53:13](https://youtu.be/aliu6yertgo?t=3193) talking about the palestine israel  
[0:53:14](https://youtu.be/aliu6yertgo?t=3194) conflict and she was referring to those  
[0:53:16](https://youtu.be/aliu6yertgo?t=3196) palestinians  
[0:53:17](https://youtu.be/aliu6yertgo?t=3197) she's on our side let's say for that i  
[0:53:19](https://youtu.be/aliu6yertgo?t=3199) was happy with that obviously but then  
[0:53:20](https://youtu.be/aliu6yertgo?t=3200) on the other hand i was thinking why is  
[0:53:22](https://youtu.be/aliu6yertgo?t=3202) she mentioning palestinians  
[0:53:24](https://youtu.be/aliu6yertgo?t=3204) and israelis in that language because  
[0:53:26](https://youtu.be/aliu6yertgo?t=3206) that is to categorize them  
[0:53:28](https://youtu.be/aliu6yertgo?t=3208) according to a transcendental or some  
[0:53:30](https://youtu.be/aliu6yertgo?t=3210) kind of yeah  
[0:53:31](https://youtu.be/aliu6yertgo?t=3211) right right you know it's some kind of  
[0:53:32](https://youtu.be/aliu6yertgo?t=3212) genus yeah some sort ontrological  
[0:53:34](https://youtu.be/aliu6yertgo?t=3214) category yeah  
[0:53:34](https://youtu.be/aliu6yertgo?t=3214) so so what i'm saying here is that so  
[0:53:37](https://youtu.be/aliu6yertgo?t=3217) you in  
[0:53:38](https://youtu.be/aliu6yertgo?t=3218) everyday life you're compelled to think  
[0:53:40](https://youtu.be/aliu6yertgo?t=3220) that there is some demarcating factor  
[0:53:42](https://youtu.be/aliu6yertgo?t=3222) between person or people x and people y  
[0:53:45](https://youtu.be/aliu6yertgo?t=3225) but in your skeptical post-modern  
[0:53:48](https://youtu.be/aliu6yertgo?t=3228) um quantification you're you're very  
[0:53:51](https://youtu.be/aliu6yertgo?t=3231) strong you know very very delicate when  
[0:53:53](https://youtu.be/aliu6yertgo?t=3233) it comes to the material right  
[0:53:54](https://youtu.be/aliu6yertgo?t=3234) so a matter of you know differentiation  
[0:53:56](https://youtu.be/aliu6yertgo?t=3236) when it comes to sex  
[0:53:58](https://youtu.be/aliu6yertgo?t=3238) sex and gender so you want to have your  
[0:54:00](https://youtu.be/aliu6yertgo?t=3240) taken in your book the truth of the  
[0:54:01](https://youtu.be/aliu6yertgo?t=3241) matter is you can't really speak about  
[0:54:02](https://youtu.be/aliu6yertgo?t=3242) racism  
[0:54:03](https://youtu.be/aliu6yertgo?t=3243) unless we speak about race and we can't  
[0:54:04](https://youtu.be/aliu6yertgo?t=3244) speak about race until we talk about  
[0:54:06](https://youtu.be/aliu6yertgo?t=3246) biology and we can't talk about biology  
[0:54:08](https://youtu.be/aliu6yertgo?t=3248) if you're a postmodernist and you deny  
[0:54:10](https://youtu.be/aliu6yertgo?t=3250) it  
[0:54:10](https://youtu.be/aliu6yertgo?t=3250) but if the same thing applies now with  
[0:54:12](https://youtu.be/aliu6yertgo?t=3252) um  
[0:54:14](https://youtu.be/aliu6yertgo?t=3254) with sex and gender i remember being in  
[0:54:16](https://youtu.be/aliu6yertgo?t=3256) the i don't know if i told you a story  
[0:54:18](https://youtu.be/aliu6yertgo?t=3258) before i was in the  
[0:54:19](https://youtu.be/aliu6yertgo?t=3259) elevator one time and there was a woman  
[0:54:22](https://youtu.be/aliu6yertgo?t=3262) who was part of the course as well doing  
[0:54:23](https://youtu.be/aliu6yertgo?t=3263) gender society stuff  
[0:54:25](https://youtu.be/aliu6yertgo?t=3265) and she's just for some reason she  
[0:54:26](https://youtu.be/aliu6yertgo?t=3266) blurted something out she said i believe  
[0:54:28](https://youtu.be/aliu6yertgo?t=3268) that sex  
[0:54:30](https://youtu.be/aliu6yertgo?t=3270) like actually have penetrative sex like  
[0:54:31](https://youtu.be/aliu6yertgo?t=3271) intimacy right  
[0:54:33](https://youtu.be/aliu6yertgo?t=3273) intercourse she says i believe that sex  
[0:54:35](https://youtu.be/aliu6yertgo?t=3275) is a social construct  
[0:54:37](https://youtu.be/aliu6yertgo?t=3277) so it was only like 10 seconds left  
[0:54:38](https://youtu.be/aliu6yertgo?t=3278) before i got out the lift i thought  
[0:54:40](https://youtu.be/aliu6yertgo?t=3280) she's saying something ridiculous let me  
[0:54:41](https://youtu.be/aliu6yertgo?t=3281) say something ridiculous too  
[0:54:43](https://youtu.be/aliu6yertgo?t=3283) i said i said in that case then rape is  
[0:54:45](https://youtu.be/aliu6yertgo?t=3285) a social construct  
[0:54:46](https://youtu.be/aliu6yertgo?t=3286) oh you know because they don't write  
[0:54:48](https://youtu.be/aliu6yertgo?t=3288) they don't realize  
[0:54:49](https://youtu.be/aliu6yertgo?t=3289) the ramifications of what they're saying  
[0:54:51](https://youtu.be/aliu6yertgo?t=3291) if you say that sex is a social  
[0:54:53](https://youtu.be/aliu6yertgo?t=3293) construct now a rape of a conversation  
[0:54:54](https://youtu.be/aliu6yertgo?t=3294) if you say that racist social a racism  
[0:54:56](https://youtu.be/aliu6yertgo?t=3296) becomes a social construct if you say  
[0:54:58](https://youtu.be/aliu6yertgo?t=3298) that  
[0:54:58](https://youtu.be/aliu6yertgo?t=3298) gender is a social construct then  
[0:55:00](https://youtu.be/aliu6yertgo?t=3300) patriarchy in the words  
[0:55:02](https://youtu.be/aliu6yertgo?t=3302) in in the words which capture this  
[0:55:04](https://youtu.be/aliu6yertgo?t=3304) really well  
[0:55:05](https://youtu.be/aliu6yertgo?t=3305) if you make an uncomfortable bed you  
[0:55:07](https://youtu.be/aliu6yertgo?t=3307) have to lie in it wow man  
[0:55:08](https://youtu.be/aliu6yertgo?t=3308) you don't even know these words you're  
[0:55:10](https://youtu.be/aliu6yertgo?t=3310) writing them down no these these these  
[0:55:12](https://youtu.be/aliu6yertgo?t=3312) are just  
[0:55:13](https://youtu.be/aliu6yertgo?t=3313) things you pick up when you read and  
[0:55:14](https://youtu.be/aliu6yertgo?t=3314) stuff somebody

[0:56:08](https://youtu.be/aliu6yertgo?t=3368) uh regarding geodesy i was  
[0:56:12](https://youtu.be/aliu6yertgo?t=3372) today i was studying about the christian  
[0:56:14](https://youtu.be/aliu6yertgo?t=3374) narrative regarding theodicy  
[0:56:16](https://youtu.be/aliu6yertgo?t=3376) i studied the augustine theodicy and  
[0:56:19](https://youtu.be/aliu6yertgo?t=3379) iranian theodicy i found iranian  
[0:56:23](https://youtu.be/aliu6yertgo?t=3383) theodicy  
[0:56:24](https://youtu.be/aliu6yertgo?t=3384) uh something closer to the islamic  
[0:56:26](https://youtu.be/aliu6yertgo?t=3386) understanding i  
[0:56:27](https://youtu.be/aliu6yertgo?t=3387) i want to know your opinion upon that  
[0:56:30](https://youtu.be/aliu6yertgo?t=3390) what is the iron in philosophy  
[0:56:33](https://youtu.be/aliu6yertgo?t=3393) yeah well well um islamic understanding  
[0:56:36](https://youtu.be/aliu6yertgo?t=3396) is one thing  
[0:56:37](https://youtu.be/aliu6yertgo?t=3397) theodicy in islam and theology and  
[0:56:39](https://youtu.be/aliu6yertgo?t=3399) christianity are  
[0:56:41](https://youtu.be/aliu6yertgo?t=3401) not monolithic things the schools of  
[0:56:44](https://youtu.be/aliu6yertgo?t=3404) thought  
[0:56:44](https://youtu.be/aliu6yertgo?t=3404) and christianity are different to the  
[0:56:46](https://youtu.be/aliu6yertgo?t=3406) schools of thought in islam  
[0:56:48](https://youtu.be/aliu6yertgo?t=3408) augustine you talked about augustine i'm  
[0:56:50](https://youtu.be/aliu6yertgo?t=3410) not sure which book he wrote this in but  
[0:56:51](https://youtu.be/aliu6yertgo?t=3411) he  
[0:56:52](https://youtu.be/aliu6yertgo?t=3412) had very very troubling opinions i'm not  
[0:56:54](https://youtu.be/aliu6yertgo?t=3414) sure if you know this right augustine  
[0:56:56](https://youtu.be/aliu6yertgo?t=3416) obviously is the same for the catholic  
[0:56:58](https://youtu.be/aliu6yertgo?t=3418) church and he believed that if an infant  
[0:57:00](https://youtu.be/aliu6yertgo?t=3420) does not get baptized it will go to hell  
[0:57:03](https://youtu.be/aliu6yertgo?t=3423) yeah i'm not have you have you read that  
[0:57:05](https://youtu.be/aliu6yertgo?t=3425) that's part of his odyssey and part of  
[0:57:07](https://youtu.be/aliu6yertgo?t=3427) his writing theological writings on the  
[0:57:09](https://youtu.be/aliu6yertgo?t=3429) matter  
[0:57:10](https://youtu.be/aliu6yertgo?t=3430) so he believed that if this is very  
[0:57:12](https://youtu.be/aliu6yertgo?t=3432) categorical in his speech i only  
[0:57:14](https://youtu.be/aliu6yertgo?t=3434) recently i think it was rat single one  
[0:57:15](https://youtu.be/aliu6yertgo?t=3435) of the  
[0:57:16](https://youtu.be/aliu6yertgo?t=3436) popes he made um  
[0:57:19](https://youtu.be/aliu6yertgo?t=3439) he made a kind of uh declaration that  
[0:57:21](https://youtu.be/aliu6yertgo?t=3441) this is  
[0:57:22](https://youtu.be/aliu6yertgo?t=3442) you kind of moved away from that but for  
[0:57:24](https://youtu.be/aliu6yertgo?t=3444) the fourth thousands of years now you  
[0:57:26](https://youtu.be/aliu6yertgo?t=3446) know the catholics have been upon this  
[0:57:27](https://youtu.be/aliu6yertgo?t=3447) and they believe that  
[0:57:28](https://youtu.be/aliu6yertgo?t=3448) now the theology of islam  
[0:57:32](https://youtu.be/aliu6yertgo?t=3452) first of all we have to define what is  
[0:57:33](https://youtu.be/aliu6yertgo?t=3453) evil  
[0:57:35](https://youtu.be/aliu6yertgo?t=3455) uh and this is a subject of contention  
[0:57:38](https://youtu.be/aliu6yertgo?t=3458) for islamic scholars okay  
[0:57:40](https://youtu.be/aliu6yertgo?t=3460) now um does evil exist in the real world  
[0:57:44](https://youtu.be/aliu6yertgo?t=3464) as in the platonic realism or as in  
[0:57:46](https://youtu.be/aliu6yertgo?t=3466) conceptualism or as  
[0:57:48](https://youtu.be/aliu6yertgo?t=3468) in does actually even exist now there's  
[0:57:50](https://youtu.be/aliu6yertgo?t=3470) a question which is there's there's  
[0:57:52](https://youtu.be/aliu6yertgo?t=3472) difference of opinion on so the ash  
[0:57:53](https://youtu.be/aliu6yertgo?t=3473) haris and the maturities and the matases  
[0:57:55](https://youtu.be/aliu6yertgo?t=3475) would say yeah  
[0:57:55](https://youtu.be/aliu6yertgo?t=3475) evil exists in that sense and the evil  
[0:57:58](https://youtu.be/aliu6yertgo?t=3478) is  
[0:57:58](https://youtu.be/aliu6yertgo?t=3478) to go to the euro throws dilemma is  
[0:58:01](https://youtu.be/aliu6yertgo?t=3481) dependent or contingent on  
[0:58:03](https://youtu.be/aliu6yertgo?t=3483) the divine command theory so whatever  
[0:58:04](https://youtu.be/aliu6yertgo?t=3484) god makes whatever god  
[0:58:06](https://youtu.be/aliu6yertgo?t=3486) says is wrong is wrong because of his  
[0:58:08](https://youtu.be/aliu6yertgo?t=3488) very saying  
[0:58:10](https://youtu.be/aliu6yertgo?t=3490) but even tamiya doesn't believe in that  
[0:58:11](https://youtu.be/aliu6yertgo?t=3491) and neither does  
[0:58:13](https://youtu.be/aliu6yertgo?t=3493) jose who wrote a book on this called  
[0:58:16](https://youtu.be/aliu6yertgo?t=3496) they believe that they believe that evil  
[0:58:19](https://youtu.be/aliu6yertgo?t=3499) is adam  
[0:58:20](https://youtu.be/aliu6yertgo?t=3500) evil is privation okay so they believe  
[0:58:22](https://youtu.be/aliu6yertgo?t=3502) that evil is  
[0:58:23](https://youtu.be/aliu6yertgo?t=3503) when something lacks to call a  
[0:58:25](https://youtu.be/aliu6yertgo?t=3505) particular quality  
[0:58:26](https://youtu.be/aliu6yertgo?t=3506) uh why do they say that because they  
[0:58:29](https://youtu.be/aliu6yertgo?t=3509) have different  
[0:58:29](https://youtu.be/aliu6yertgo?t=3509) approaches to the attributes of god than  
[0:58:32](https://youtu.be/aliu6yertgo?t=3512) ashari's do  
[0:58:33](https://youtu.be/aliu6yertgo?t=3513) say god is good okay god is good and  
[0:58:36](https://youtu.be/aliu6yertgo?t=3516) this is not something which we take as  
[0:58:38](https://youtu.be/aliu6yertgo?t=3518) metaphoric  
[0:58:39](https://youtu.be/aliu6yertgo?t=3519) and maturities and more attendees take  
[0:58:41](https://youtu.be/aliu6yertgo?t=3521) that as metaphoric okay  
[0:58:43](https://youtu.be/aliu6yertgo?t=3523) you have to understand that so if asha  
[0:58:45](https://youtu.be/aliu6yertgo?t=3525) is saying  
[0:58:46](https://youtu.be/aliu6yertgo?t=3526) that he's not actually good in the sense  
[0:58:49](https://youtu.be/aliu6yertgo?t=3529) like  
[0:58:50](https://youtu.be/aliu6yertgo?t=3530) they do take a wheel of that right so  
[0:58:52](https://youtu.be/aliu6yertgo?t=3532) the uh event  
[0:58:53](https://youtu.be/aliu6yertgo?t=3533) he says no god is good and any anything  
[0:58:56](https://youtu.be/aliu6yertgo?t=3536) good  
[0:58:57](https://youtu.be/aliu6yertgo?t=3537) is a manifestation of the goodness of  
[0:58:58](https://youtu.be/aliu6yertgo?t=3538) god and so therefore anything  
[0:59:01](https://youtu.be/aliu6yertgo?t=3541) other than anything bad is defined as  
[0:59:04](https://youtu.be/aliu6yertgo?t=3544) the  
[0:59:04](https://youtu.be/aliu6yertgo?t=3544) privation or the deprivation or the  
[0:59:07](https://youtu.be/aliu6yertgo?t=3547) elimination  
[0:59:08](https://youtu.be/aliu6yertgo?t=3548) of that goodly quality of god  
[0:59:11](https://youtu.be/aliu6yertgo?t=3551) in the thing from that then they move on  
[0:59:14](https://youtu.be/aliu6yertgo?t=3554) to  
[0:59:15](https://youtu.be/aliu6yertgo?t=3555) well what so therefore a shovel as he  
[0:59:18](https://youtu.be/aliu6yertgo?t=3558) referred to as  
[0:59:19](https://youtu.be/aliu6yertgo?t=3559) both which is pure evil doesn't exist in  
[0:59:22](https://youtu.be/aliu6yertgo?t=3562) real world according to them  
[0:59:23](https://youtu.be/aliu6yertgo?t=3563) and pure evil is something which is  
[0:59:25](https://youtu.be/aliu6yertgo?t=3565) relative to the situation  
[0:59:28](https://youtu.be/aliu6yertgo?t=3568) uh and and so on so first of all  
[0:59:30](https://youtu.be/aliu6yertgo?t=3570) defining what is evil is something which  
[0:59:32](https://youtu.be/aliu6yertgo?t=3572) this like islamist cause is diffident  
[0:59:34](https://youtu.be/aliu6yertgo?t=3574) uh we need to understand that and so  
[0:59:37](https://youtu.be/aliu6yertgo?t=3577) have christian scholars if different on  
[0:59:39](https://youtu.be/aliu6yertgo?t=3579) what is evil in the first place  
[0:59:41](https://youtu.be/aliu6yertgo?t=3581) now the questions then then that we then  
[0:59:44](https://youtu.be/aliu6yertgo?t=3584) ask about  
[0:59:45](https://youtu.be/aliu6yertgo?t=3585) why is there even and suffering in the  
[0:59:46](https://youtu.be/aliu6yertgo?t=3586) world and all these kinds of questions  
[0:59:48](https://youtu.be/aliu6yertgo?t=3588) which relate to theodicy and so on  
[0:59:50](https://youtu.be/aliu6yertgo?t=3590) they are really highly dependent on this  
[0:59:52](https://youtu.be/aliu6yertgo?t=3592) on this  
[0:59:53](https://youtu.be/aliu6yertgo?t=3593) starting point so we have to understand  
[0:59:55](https://youtu.be/aliu6yertgo?t=3595) that islam has different opinions on  
[0:59:56](https://youtu.be/aliu6yertgo?t=3596) what evil is  
[0:59:57](https://youtu.be/aliu6yertgo?t=3597) i personally i'm more inclined to even  
[0:59:59](https://youtu.be/aliu6yertgo?t=3599) tell me an explanation  
[1:00:00](https://youtu.be/aliu6yertgo?t=3600) because then if you if someone was to  
[1:00:02](https://youtu.be/aliu6yertgo?t=3602) say well um divine command theory right  
[1:00:05](https://youtu.be/aliu6yertgo?t=3605) which is what shall we say if someone  
[1:00:07](https://youtu.be/aliu6yertgo?t=3607) says divine command theory  
[1:00:09](https://youtu.be/aliu6yertgo?t=3609) well then if allah subhanahu wa in the  
[1:00:11](https://youtu.be/aliu6yertgo?t=3611) quran because when i read this verse i  
[1:00:12](https://youtu.be/aliu6yertgo?t=3612) kind of was more persuaded to his  
[1:00:14](https://youtu.be/aliu6yertgo?t=3614) perspective  
[1:00:17](https://youtu.be/aliu6yertgo?t=3617) allah does not command to evil  
[1:00:20](https://youtu.be/aliu6yertgo?t=3620) which suggests to us that it may suggest  
[1:00:23](https://youtu.be/aliu6yertgo?t=3623) okay that evil exists  
[1:00:24](https://youtu.be/aliu6yertgo?t=3624) as an ontological entity right which  
[1:00:26](https://youtu.be/aliu6yertgo?t=3626) will be against whatever tommy has said  
[1:00:28](https://youtu.be/aliu6yertgo?t=3628) but on the other hand  
[1:00:29](https://youtu.be/aliu6yertgo?t=3629) if the just that people has been who was  
[1:00:32](https://youtu.be/aliu6yertgo?t=3632) there before the command was there  
[1:00:33](https://youtu.be/aliu6yertgo?t=3633) does that make sense so if because they  
[1:00:35](https://youtu.be/aliu6yertgo?t=3635) are saying the evil is because allah  
[1:00:37](https://youtu.be/aliu6yertgo?t=3637) made  
[1:00:37](https://youtu.be/aliu6yertgo?t=3637) he said it because he says evil becomes  
[1:00:40](https://youtu.be/aliu6yertgo?t=3640) evil  
[1:00:40](https://youtu.be/aliu6yertgo?t=3640) now we're saying that if allah says  
[1:00:44](https://youtu.be/aliu6yertgo?t=3644) that would be a meaningless thing right  
[1:00:47](https://youtu.be/aliu6yertgo?t=3647) which is actually they believe that you  
[1:00:50](https://youtu.be/aliu6yertgo?t=3650) can  
[1:00:51](https://youtu.be/aliu6yertgo?t=3651) stumble or you can extrapolate evilness  
[1:00:53](https://youtu.be/aliu6yertgo?t=3653) from the real world  
[1:00:55](https://youtu.be/aliu6yertgo?t=3655) without an us without some kind of thing  
[1:00:57](https://youtu.be/aliu6yertgo?t=3657) so in many ways  
[1:00:58](https://youtu.be/aliu6yertgo?t=3658) the martessilis and the intamia school  
[1:01:00](https://youtu.be/aliu6yertgo?t=3660) or the athletes actually  
[1:01:02](https://youtu.be/aliu6yertgo?t=3662) uh coalesce at this point the point  
[1:01:04](https://youtu.be/aliu6yertgo?t=3664) being here i don't want to go into too  
[1:01:05](https://youtu.be/aliu6yertgo?t=3665) much  
[1:01:05](https://youtu.be/aliu6yertgo?t=3665) details you know depending on how you  
[1:01:08](https://youtu.be/aliu6yertgo?t=3668) define evil  
[1:01:09](https://youtu.be/aliu6yertgo?t=3669) then we'll have different answers to the  
[1:01:11](https://youtu.be/aliu6yertgo?t=3671) european dilemma which is a very  
[1:01:12](https://youtu.be/aliu6yertgo?t=3672) important dilemma  
[1:01:13](https://youtu.be/aliu6yertgo?t=3673) so islam does not have one singular  
[1:01:15](https://youtu.be/aliu6yertgo?t=3675) answer here through a divine level we'll  
[1:01:16](https://youtu.be/aliu6yertgo?t=3676) have different answers  
[1:01:17](https://youtu.be/aliu6yertgo?t=3677) uh the problem with if you take a divine  
[1:01:19](https://youtu.be/aliu6yertgo?t=3679) command theory is what europe  
[1:01:21](https://youtu.be/aliu6yertgo?t=3681) talked about is it only good because  
[1:01:23](https://youtu.be/aliu6yertgo?t=3683) allah said it's good that's one problem  
[1:01:25](https://youtu.be/aliu6yertgo?t=3685) but a secondary problem is  
[1:01:26](https://youtu.be/aliu6yertgo?t=3686) then you have certain questions which  
[1:01:27](https://youtu.be/aliu6yertgo?t=3687) you'll have to answer in the positive  
[1:01:29](https://youtu.be/aliu6yertgo?t=3689) which may  
[1:01:30](https://youtu.be/aliu6yertgo?t=3690) be very uncomfortable for you to do so  
[1:01:31](https://youtu.be/aliu6yertgo?t=3691) if you take this view which is if allah  
[1:01:33](https://youtu.be/aliu6yertgo?t=3693) said it was  
[1:01:34](https://youtu.be/aliu6yertgo?t=3694) it was okay to rape a two-year-old child  
[1:01:36](https://youtu.be/aliu6yertgo?t=3696) does it become okay just because he said  
[1:01:38](https://youtu.be/aliu6yertgo?t=3698) it  
[1:01:38](https://youtu.be/aliu6yertgo?t=3698) and on that view you'd have to say yes  
[1:01:40](https://youtu.be/aliu6yertgo?t=3700) on the view  
[1:01:42](https://youtu.be/aliu6yertgo?t=3702) that uh they've been telling me if you  
[1:01:44](https://youtu.be/aliu6yertgo?t=3704) would say no  
[1:01:45](https://youtu.be/aliu6yertgo?t=3705) uh that allah would not command that  
[1:01:46](https://youtu.be/aliu6yertgo?t=3706) because in allah almighty  
[1:01:49](https://youtu.be/aliu6yertgo?t=3709) and that is for in and of itself which  
[1:01:51](https://youtu.be/aliu6yertgo?t=3711) means it's something which is lewd and  
[1:01:53](https://youtu.be/aliu6yertgo?t=3713) unacceptable so you have to think about  
[1:01:55](https://youtu.be/aliu6yertgo?t=3715) where you lie on the spectrum of belief  
[1:01:57](https://youtu.be/aliu6yertgo?t=3717) here  
[1:01:57](https://youtu.be/aliu6yertgo?t=3717) uh i think i've indicated where i think  
[1:01:59](https://youtu.be/aliu6yertgo?t=3719) i'm more comfortable i'm a bit  
[1:02:00](https://youtu.be/aliu6yertgo?t=3720) less comfortable with even tamiya's  
[1:02:03](https://youtu.be/aliu6yertgo?t=3723) clear  
[1:02:04](https://youtu.be/aliu6yertgo?t=3724) nominalism on these points but i'm more  
[1:02:06](https://youtu.be/aliu6yertgo?t=3726) comfortable with his uh  
[1:02:07](https://youtu.be/aliu6yertgo?t=3727) explanation of allah's attribute being  
[1:02:10](https://youtu.be/aliu6yertgo?t=3730) and uh him being the goodness and that  
[1:02:12](https://youtu.be/aliu6yertgo?t=3732) pride the evil is  
[1:02:14](https://youtu.be/aliu6yertgo?t=3734) privation of that goodness in a  
[1:02:15](https://youtu.be/aliu6yertgo?t=3735) particular thing so i'm not too  
[1:02:17](https://youtu.be/aliu6yertgo?t=3737) like the the way that you explained it  
[1:02:20](https://youtu.be/aliu6yertgo?t=3740) there i'm aware of this  
[1:02:22](https://youtu.be/aliu6yertgo?t=3742) but in terms of you're saying the other  
[1:02:25](https://youtu.be/aliu6yertgo?t=3745) uh schools hold the view that objective  
[1:02:28](https://youtu.be/aliu6yertgo?t=3748) morality doesn't exist  
[1:02:30](https://youtu.be/aliu6yertgo?t=3750) uh they do i don't think another  
[1:02:34](https://youtu.be/aliu6yertgo?t=3754) objective morality everyone says  
[1:02:35](https://youtu.be/aliu6yertgo?t=3755) objective money exists right everyone  
[1:02:37](https://youtu.be/aliu6yertgo?t=3757) says that  
[1:02:38](https://youtu.be/aliu6yertgo?t=3758) but the only thing is a lot of people  
[1:02:40](https://youtu.be/aliu6yertgo?t=3760) make a difference like and  
[1:02:41](https://youtu.be/aliu6yertgo?t=3761) hamsa's also talks about this quite well  
[1:02:43](https://youtu.be/aliu6yertgo?t=3763) there's a difference between objection  
[1:02:44](https://youtu.be/aliu6yertgo?t=3764) absolutely right no i get that you know  
[1:02:46](https://youtu.be/aliu6yertgo?t=3766) you for example a god commanding what is  
[1:02:50](https://youtu.be/aliu6yertgo?t=3770) evil um i'm assuming that even  
[1:02:54](https://youtu.be/aliu6yertgo?t=3774) within the other schools the it's a lot  
[1:02:56](https://youtu.be/aliu6yertgo?t=3776) more nuanced than that  
[1:02:57](https://youtu.be/aliu6yertgo?t=3777) that they probably have sub types for  
[1:03:00](https://youtu.be/aliu6yertgo?t=3780) example the maturities  
[1:03:10](https://youtu.be/aliu6yertgo?t=3790) like uh that's a question so they might  
[1:03:12](https://youtu.be/aliu6yertgo?t=3792) really just say no it's not possible so  
[1:03:14](https://youtu.be/aliu6yertgo?t=3794) i'm not  
[1:03:14](https://youtu.be/aliu6yertgo?t=3794) the kind of pelvis whatever and then the  
[1:03:16](https://youtu.be/aliu6yertgo?t=3796) video going to say yes because why can't  
[1:03:18](https://youtu.be/aliu6yertgo?t=3798) he not you can do  
[1:03:19](https://youtu.be/aliu6yertgo?t=3799) everything that he wants so the bundys  
[1:03:21](https://youtu.be/aliu6yertgo?t=3801) are very broad though so it's just a  
[1:03:23](https://youtu.be/aliu6yertgo?t=3803) well i think it looks like that's what  
[1:03:25](https://youtu.be/aliu6yertgo?t=3805) the debate is between those two schools  
[1:03:26](https://youtu.be/aliu6yertgo?t=3806) but  
[1:03:27](https://youtu.be/aliu6yertgo?t=3807) i don't know if everyone would say that  
[1:03:28](https://youtu.be/aliu6yertgo?t=3808) but the idea is really if you take the  
[1:03:30](https://youtu.be/aliu6yertgo?t=3810) position allah  
[1:03:31](https://youtu.be/aliu6yertgo?t=3811) like what we say because well the  
[1:03:33](https://youtu.be/aliu6yertgo?t=3813) athletic school would say  
[1:03:35](https://youtu.be/aliu6yertgo?t=3815) if allah subhanahu wa is good then he  
[1:03:37](https://youtu.be/aliu6yertgo?t=3817) can't really do  
[1:03:38](https://youtu.be/aliu6yertgo?t=3818) is against his majesty to do things  
[1:03:40](https://youtu.be/aliu6yertgo?t=3820) which are against his intrinsic  
[1:03:41](https://youtu.be/aliu6yertgo?t=3821) characteristic  
[1:03:42](https://youtu.be/aliu6yertgo?t=3822) so truth it's against the attribute of  
[1:03:45](https://youtu.be/aliu6yertgo?t=3825) haqq to lie so it becomes almost as  
[1:03:48](https://youtu.be/aliu6yertgo?t=3828) impossible as  
[1:03:49](https://youtu.be/aliu6yertgo?t=3829) uh it's as meaningless as allah creating  
[1:03:52](https://youtu.be/aliu6yertgo?t=3832) a squared circle  
[1:03:53](https://youtu.be/aliu6yertgo?t=3833) but for that high school is that  
[1:03:56](https://youtu.be/aliu6yertgo?t=3836) attribute is is  
[1:03:59](https://youtu.be/aliu6yertgo?t=3839) you're making tawi love in the first  
[1:04:01](https://youtu.be/aliu6yertgo?t=3841) place so you can't really say that it's  
[1:04:03](https://youtu.be/aliu6yertgo?t=3843) impossible in that sense yeah so  
[1:04:05](https://youtu.be/aliu6yertgo?t=3845) based on where you start from really it  
[1:04:06](https://youtu.be/aliu6yertgo?t=3846) does it depends if you're sometimes  
[1:04:08](https://youtu.be/aliu6yertgo?t=3848) making that wheel of the sifat of allah  
[1:04:10](https://youtu.be/aliu6yertgo?t=3850) has implications far beyond the prima  
[1:04:13](https://youtu.be/aliu6yertgo?t=3853) facie  
[1:04:14](https://youtu.be/aliu6yertgo?t=3854) examination sometimes it has it has  
[1:04:16](https://youtu.be/aliu6yertgo?t=3856) implications on the theology as well  
[1:04:18](https://youtu.be/aliu6yertgo?t=3858) okay for your question brother hazek  
[1:04:22](https://youtu.be/aliu6yertgo?t=3862) we're going to go now to arshan  
[1:04:34](https://youtu.be/aliu6yertgo?t=3874) [Music]  
[1:04:38](https://youtu.be/aliu6yertgo?t=3878) um  
[1:04:52](https://youtu.be/aliu6yertgo?t=3892) you can go uh so basically my question  
[1:04:55](https://youtu.be/aliu6yertgo?t=3895) was about  
[1:04:56](https://youtu.be/aliu6yertgo?t=3896) pantheism as i'm from india and i and  
[1:04:58](https://youtu.be/aliu6yertgo?t=3898) caught on many hindu friends  
[1:05:00](https://youtu.be/aliu6yertgo?t=3900) and we'll talk about this so how how do  
[1:05:03](https://youtu.be/aliu6yertgo?t=3903) we go with pantheism  
[1:05:04](https://youtu.be/aliu6yertgo?t=3904) according to the way i've um  
[1:05:07](https://youtu.be/aliu6yertgo?t=3907) the way i like to deal with that is very  
[1:05:09](https://youtu.be/aliu6yertgo?t=3909) simple which is that  
[1:05:11](https://youtu.be/aliu6yertgo?t=3911) anything that is made up of parts is  
[1:05:13](https://youtu.be/aliu6yertgo?t=3913) generated  
[1:05:15](https://youtu.be/aliu6yertgo?t=3915) the universe is made up of parts  
[1:05:17](https://youtu.be/aliu6yertgo?t=3917) therefore the universe is generated if  
[1:05:18](https://youtu.be/aliu6yertgo?t=3918) god is everywhere  
[1:05:20](https://youtu.be/aliu6yertgo?t=3920) with his essence which is in in the  
[1:05:22](https://youtu.be/aliu6yertgo?t=3922) arabic terms called  
[1:05:24](https://youtu.be/aliu6yertgo?t=3924) pantheism if god is everywhere in this  
[1:05:26](https://youtu.be/aliu6yertgo?t=3926) sense this would  
[1:05:28](https://youtu.be/aliu6yertgo?t=3928) uh entail but he can be divided into  
[1:05:30](https://youtu.be/aliu6yertgo?t=3930) pieces  
[1:05:32](https://youtu.be/aliu6yertgo?t=3932) because if he's everywhere in his  
[1:05:33](https://youtu.be/aliu6yertgo?t=3933) essence that means he in he in his  
[1:05:36](https://youtu.be/aliu6yertgo?t=3936) he inherits in every single aspect  
[1:05:40](https://youtu.be/aliu6yertgo?t=3940) of creation which includes parts and i  
[1:05:42](https://youtu.be/aliu6yertgo?t=3942) think that can be broken up  
[1:05:44](https://youtu.be/aliu6yertgo?t=3944) and that would entail if the car or the  
[1:05:46](https://youtu.be/aliu6yertgo?t=3946) idea of  
[1:05:48](https://youtu.be/aliu6yertgo?t=3948) dependence and that would entail being  
[1:05:49](https://youtu.be/aliu6yertgo?t=3949) generated and the evidence of that in  
[1:05:51](https://youtu.be/aliu6yertgo?t=3951) the quran is the last panel  
[1:05:52](https://youtu.be/aliu6yertgo?t=3952) mentions  
[1:05:59](https://youtu.be/aliu6yertgo?t=3959) that he is the one who  
[1:06:02](https://youtu.be/aliu6yertgo?t=3962) created  
[1:06:08](https://youtu.be/aliu6yertgo?t=3968) in any form that he wanted to he done  
[1:06:10](https://youtu.be/aliu6yertgo?t=3970) turkey of you he put you together  
[1:06:12](https://youtu.be/aliu6yertgo?t=3972) meaning what meaning really what we can  
[1:06:14](https://youtu.be/aliu6yertgo?t=3974) understand is that anything which is  
[1:06:16](https://youtu.be/aliu6yertgo?t=3976) moroccan or is made up of individual  
[1:06:18](https://youtu.be/aliu6yertgo?t=3978) parts which can be  
[1:06:20](https://youtu.be/aliu6yertgo?t=3980) divided divided really this requires an  
[1:06:23](https://youtu.be/aliu6yertgo?t=3983) external agency in order to put it  
[1:06:24](https://youtu.be/aliu6yertgo?t=3984) together  
[1:06:25](https://youtu.be/aliu6yertgo?t=3985) otherwise it wouldn't exist and so the  
[1:06:28](https://youtu.be/aliu6yertgo?t=3988) pantheistic model it puts  
[1:06:30](https://youtu.be/aliu6yertgo?t=3990) god's um power and it puts his  
[1:06:34](https://youtu.be/aliu6yertgo?t=3994) indivisibility into great distribute  
[1:06:37](https://youtu.be/aliu6yertgo?t=3997) um and therefore it's it's an absurd  
[1:06:40](https://youtu.be/aliu6yertgo?t=4000) concept  
[1:06:41](https://youtu.be/aliu6yertgo?t=4001) in contra in in contrasting with god i  
[1:06:43](https://youtu.be/aliu6yertgo?t=4003) think it's  
[1:06:44](https://youtu.be/aliu6yertgo?t=4004) it's impossible to believe in this  
[1:06:45](https://youtu.be/aliu6yertgo?t=4005) actually i'm believing god i think  
[1:06:47](https://youtu.be/aliu6yertgo?t=4007) that's a  
[1:06:47](https://youtu.be/aliu6yertgo?t=4007) that's actually talking about religious  
[1:06:49](https://youtu.be/aliu6yertgo?t=4009) implications i think if someone believes  
[1:06:50](https://youtu.be/aliu6yertgo?t=4010) in the pantheons to go like  
[1:06:52](https://youtu.be/aliu6yertgo?t=4012) i've heard some sikhs say that you know  
[1:06:55](https://youtu.be/aliu6yertgo?t=4015) a guru nanak  
[1:06:56](https://youtu.be/aliu6yertgo?t=4016) guru nanak to god  
[1:07:00](https://youtu.be/aliu6yertgo?t=4020) okay is like you know a drop of a drop  
[1:07:02](https://youtu.be/aliu6yertgo?t=4022) of water in the ocean  
[1:07:04](https://youtu.be/aliu6yertgo?t=4024) so in other words he's part of him right  
[1:07:06](https://youtu.be/aliu6yertgo?t=4026) we say okay in that case you can  
[1:07:07](https://youtu.be/aliu6yertgo?t=4027) so if god can be taken like water out of  
[1:07:10](https://youtu.be/aliu6yertgo?t=4030) an ocean that means god can be emptied  
[1:07:11](https://youtu.be/aliu6yertgo?t=4031) like an ocean  
[1:07:12](https://youtu.be/aliu6yertgo?t=4032) and you can put more water into the  
[1:07:13](https://youtu.be/aliu6yertgo?t=4033) ocean and that would suggest that god is  
[1:07:15](https://youtu.be/aliu6yertgo?t=4035) some kind of physical thing  
[1:07:17](https://youtu.be/aliu6yertgo?t=4037) this is a kind of anthropomorphism  
[1:07:18](https://youtu.be/aliu6yertgo?t=4038) because panthers  
[1:07:24](https://youtu.be/aliu6yertgo?t=4044) yeah and i think another point which is  
[1:07:26](https://youtu.be/aliu6yertgo?t=4046) ver very important  
[1:07:28](https://youtu.be/aliu6yertgo?t=4048) to understand from a from the  
[1:07:30](https://youtu.be/aliu6yertgo?t=4050) perspective of polytheism  
[1:07:32](https://youtu.be/aliu6yertgo?t=4052) and islamic monotheism  
[1:07:36](https://youtu.be/aliu6yertgo?t=4056) is rather than just talking about the  
[1:07:40](https://youtu.be/aliu6yertgo?t=4060) for example you know they they  
[1:07:44](https://youtu.be/aliu6yertgo?t=4064) the the hindus will say okay we've been  
[1:07:46](https://youtu.be/aliu6yertgo?t=4066) this  
[1:07:47](https://youtu.be/aliu6yertgo?t=4067) right and you believe in that i think  
[1:07:49](https://youtu.be/aliu6yertgo?t=4069) it's important as well  
[1:07:51](https://youtu.be/aliu6yertgo?t=4071) to actually show them that  
[1:07:55](https://youtu.be/aliu6yertgo?t=4075) if we look at the history of hinduism  
[1:07:58](https://youtu.be/aliu6yertgo?t=4078) and we look at the various different  
[1:08:00](https://youtu.be/aliu6yertgo?t=4080) types we can even argue  
[1:08:02](https://youtu.be/aliu6yertgo?t=4082) that there is no such thing as hinduism  
[1:08:05](https://youtu.be/aliu6yertgo?t=4085) right it's not actually  
[1:08:07](https://youtu.be/aliu6yertgo?t=4087) and this is very interesting and this is  
[1:08:08](https://youtu.be/aliu6yertgo?t=4088) one of the miracles of islam that  
[1:08:10](https://youtu.be/aliu6yertgo?t=4090) the center point of the hindu religion  
[1:08:14](https://youtu.be/aliu6yertgo?t=4094) is actually the modern state of pakistan  
[1:08:16](https://youtu.be/aliu6yertgo?t=4096) so the modern state of [ __ ] maybe  
[1:08:17](https://youtu.be/aliu6yertgo?t=4097) this is why  
[1:08:18](https://youtu.be/aliu6yertgo?t=4098) a lot of hindus hate pakistan right  
[1:08:20](https://youtu.be/aliu6yertgo?t=4100) because that's like the where it began  
[1:08:22](https://youtu.be/aliu6yertgo?t=4102) from and when it actually began  
[1:08:24](https://youtu.be/aliu6yertgo?t=4104) and and you start to see all these uh  
[1:08:26](https://youtu.be/aliu6yertgo?t=4106) branches and whatnot  
[1:08:28](https://youtu.be/aliu6yertgo?t=4108) it's not one religion the religion of  
[1:08:30](https://youtu.be/aliu6yertgo?t=4110) the people  
[1:08:31](https://youtu.be/aliu6yertgo?t=4111) of uh the the indus valley civilization  
[1:08:35](https://youtu.be/aliu6yertgo?t=4115) or from the hindu kush  
[1:08:36](https://youtu.be/aliu6yertgo?t=4116) they were called you know hindus  
[1:08:40](https://youtu.be/aliu6yertgo?t=4120) because they're from that geographic  
[1:08:41](https://youtu.be/aliu6yertgo?t=4121) region but it's not one religion  
[1:08:43](https://youtu.be/aliu6yertgo?t=4123) this is very interesting amongst them  
[1:08:47](https://youtu.be/aliu6yertgo?t=4127) we have historical accounts of hindus  
[1:08:50](https://youtu.be/aliu6yertgo?t=4130) right who are atheists who actually  
[1:08:52](https://youtu.be/aliu6yertgo?t=4132) don't believe in god  
[1:08:54](https://youtu.be/aliu6yertgo?t=4134) then you get hindus who actually have  
[1:08:57](https://youtu.be/aliu6yertgo?t=4137) beliefs  
[1:08:57](https://youtu.be/aliu6yertgo?t=4137) in a god or multiple gods and this type  
[1:09:01](https://youtu.be/aliu6yertgo?t=4141) of thing  
[1:09:01](https://youtu.be/aliu6yertgo?t=4141) then you have others who actually  
[1:09:03](https://youtu.be/aliu6yertgo?t=4143) believe in one god so you have all of  
[1:09:04](https://youtu.be/aliu6yertgo?t=4144) these people and they've all been  
[1:09:06](https://youtu.be/aliu6yertgo?t=4146) categorized  
[1:09:07](https://youtu.be/aliu6yertgo?t=4147) as hindus and i think what's important  
[1:09:09](https://youtu.be/aliu6yertgo?t=4149) is like hijab mentioned we can show them  
[1:09:11](https://youtu.be/aliu6yertgo?t=4151) logically  
[1:09:12](https://youtu.be/aliu6yertgo?t=4152) and using the quran that actually  
[1:09:14](https://youtu.be/aliu6yertgo?t=4154) polytheism makes no sense  
[1:09:16](https://youtu.be/aliu6yertgo?t=4156) however we can also say to them look you  
[1:09:19](https://youtu.be/aliu6yertgo?t=4159) also have to understand that there is no  
[1:09:21](https://youtu.be/aliu6yertgo?t=4161) such thing as  
[1:09:21](https://youtu.be/aliu6yertgo?t=4161) islam versus hinduism because hinduism  
[1:09:24](https://youtu.be/aliu6yertgo?t=4164) is many  
[1:09:25](https://youtu.be/aliu6yertgo?t=4165) it's not monolithic and additionally  
[1:09:28](https://youtu.be/aliu6yertgo?t=4168) what's very interesting  
[1:09:30](https://youtu.be/aliu6yertgo?t=4170) is that i had  
[1:09:33](https://youtu.be/aliu6yertgo?t=4173) obviously people remember things when  
[1:09:34](https://youtu.be/aliu6yertgo?t=4174) it's mentioned  
[1:09:36](https://youtu.be/aliu6yertgo?t=4176) in the form of a conversational story i  
[1:09:38](https://youtu.be/aliu6yertgo?t=4178) was having this conversation with this  
[1:09:40](https://youtu.be/aliu6yertgo?t=4180) hindu guy when i was at university and  
[1:09:42](https://youtu.be/aliu6yertgo?t=4182) he literally shocked me  
[1:09:43](https://youtu.be/aliu6yertgo?t=4183) because i said to him why do you believe  
[1:09:45](https://youtu.be/aliu6yertgo?t=4185) in so many different gods and he's  
[1:09:46](https://youtu.be/aliu6yertgo?t=4186) actually quite learned in hinduism he  
[1:09:48](https://youtu.be/aliu6yertgo?t=4188) takes it very seriously  
[1:09:49](https://youtu.be/aliu6yertgo?t=4189) he said we don't we actually believe  
[1:09:51](https://youtu.be/aliu6yertgo?t=4191) there's one god which this is brahman  
[1:09:53](https://youtu.be/aliu6yertgo?t=4193) right it's a good  
[1:09:54](https://youtu.be/aliu6yertgo?t=4194) brahman some say shiva  
[1:09:58](https://youtu.be/aliu6yertgo?t=4198) some others have this type of trinity of  
[1:10:00](https://youtu.be/aliu6yertgo?t=4200) hinduism  
[1:10:01](https://youtu.be/aliu6yertgo?t=4201) but ultimately they believe that all  
[1:10:04](https://youtu.be/aliu6yertgo?t=4204) of their demigods right go back to one  
[1:10:06](https://youtu.be/aliu6yertgo?t=4206) supreme  
[1:10:07](https://youtu.be/aliu6yertgo?t=4207) yeah which is how different is that to  
[1:10:09](https://youtu.be/aliu6yertgo?t=4209) the quraish not that different  
[1:10:11](https://youtu.be/aliu6yertgo?t=4211) exactly all it is all it is is that  
[1:10:14](https://youtu.be/aliu6yertgo?t=4214) polytheism look the fact is there's  
[1:10:16](https://youtu.be/aliu6yertgo?t=4216) nothing new under the sun  
[1:10:17](https://youtu.be/aliu6yertgo?t=4217) whether the quraish were worshiping  
[1:10:21](https://youtu.be/aliu6yertgo?t=4221) or shiva brahman or whatever ultimately  
[1:10:23](https://youtu.be/aliu6yertgo?t=4223) they have the same philosophy right  
[1:10:25](https://youtu.be/aliu6yertgo?t=4225) yeah so very similar to the pantheon of  
[1:10:28](https://youtu.be/aliu6yertgo?t=4228) the greeks as well  
[1:10:28](https://youtu.be/aliu6yertgo?t=4228) exactly exactly all of them actually  
[1:10:30](https://youtu.be/aliu6yertgo?t=4230) have the same i want to share something  
[1:10:33](https://youtu.be/aliu6yertgo?t=4233) which is phenomenal it's actually really  
[1:10:36](https://youtu.be/aliu6yertgo?t=4236) uh  
[1:10:36](https://youtu.be/aliu6yertgo?t=4236) something which is going to stay with me  
[1:10:38](https://youtu.be/aliu6yertgo?t=4238) till today i probably know  
[1:10:40](https://youtu.be/aliu6yertgo?t=4240) yeah so we got a phone call in the  
[1:10:43](https://youtu.be/aliu6yertgo?t=4243) office next door the ira office  
[1:10:45](https://youtu.be/aliu6yertgo?t=4245) there's a guy who wanted to  
[1:10:48](https://youtu.be/aliu6yertgo?t=4248) leave islam he's a new kong don't want  
[1:10:50](https://youtu.be/aliu6yertgo?t=4250) to leave islam you know  
[1:10:52](https://youtu.be/aliu6yertgo?t=4252) the the camera brother so  
[1:10:56](https://youtu.be/aliu6yertgo?t=4256) he said to me look there's this guy he  
[1:10:58](https://youtu.be/aliu6yertgo?t=4258) he wants to leave islam he converted to  
[1:11:00](https://youtu.be/aliu6yertgo?t=4260) islam  
[1:11:01](https://youtu.be/aliu6yertgo?t=4261) can you talk to him i said sure so i  
[1:11:03](https://youtu.be/aliu6yertgo?t=4263) rang it  
[1:11:05](https://youtu.be/aliu6yertgo?t=4265) and i said to him why do you want to  
[1:11:08](https://youtu.be/aliu6yertgo?t=4268) leave islam  
[1:11:09](https://youtu.be/aliu6yertgo?t=4269) he said i converted to islam because of  
[1:11:12](https://youtu.be/aliu6yertgo?t=4272) monotheism  
[1:11:13](https://youtu.be/aliu6yertgo?t=4273) however i went to the mosque and in the  
[1:11:16](https://youtu.be/aliu6yertgo?t=4276) mosque they had and he's up nor  
[1:11:17](https://youtu.be/aliu6yertgo?t=4277) somewhere  
[1:11:18](https://youtu.be/aliu6yertgo?t=4278) they have a picture of one of their  
[1:11:20](https://youtu.be/aliu6yertgo?t=4280) sheikhs and they told me to worship god  
[1:11:23](https://youtu.be/aliu6yertgo?t=4283) through him to actually use him as an  
[1:11:26](https://youtu.be/aliu6yertgo?t=4286) intercessor and he said  
[1:11:27](https://youtu.be/aliu6yertgo?t=4287) i only converted to islam because of  
[1:11:29](https://youtu.be/aliu6yertgo?t=4289) monotheism but if this is what islam  
[1:11:31](https://youtu.be/aliu6yertgo?t=4291) teaches then i don't want to be muslim  
[1:11:33](https://youtu.be/aliu6yertgo?t=4293) so i said to him my brother do you know  
[1:11:34](https://youtu.be/aliu6yertgo?t=4294) what your understanding of islam is that  
[1:11:37](https://youtu.be/aliu6yertgo?t=4297) islam doesn't allow this and you're  
[1:11:38](https://youtu.be/aliu6yertgo?t=4298) absolutely correct  
[1:11:39](https://youtu.be/aliu6yertgo?t=4299) islam doesn't allow to go through an  
[1:11:41](https://youtu.be/aliu6yertgo?t=4301) intercessor there must be some sect  
[1:11:43](https://youtu.be/aliu6yertgo?t=4303) that some extreme sex that he was living  
[1:11:46](https://youtu.be/aliu6yertgo?t=4306) around where they had this  
[1:11:47](https://youtu.be/aliu6yertgo?t=4307) he said that they actually had the  
[1:11:48](https://youtu.be/aliu6yertgo?t=4308) picture of the sheikh in the mosque  
[1:11:51](https://youtu.be/aliu6yertgo?t=4311) anyway so i just happened to ask him i  
[1:11:53](https://youtu.be/aliu6yertgo?t=4313) mean and the quran  
[1:11:54](https://youtu.be/aliu6yertgo?t=4314) is very clear about justice  
[1:12:00](https://youtu.be/aliu6yertgo?t=4320) and the messages are for god so don't  
[1:12:02](https://youtu.be/aliu6yertgo?t=4322) don't fall  
[1:12:03](https://youtu.be/aliu6yertgo?t=4323) any other than him in the message and  
[1:12:05](https://youtu.be/aliu6yertgo?t=4325) this is so powerful so a new muslim  
[1:12:08](https://youtu.be/aliu6yertgo?t=4328) is recognizing that when i read the  
[1:12:10](https://youtu.be/aliu6yertgo?t=4330) quran i understood that this is not  
[1:12:12](https://youtu.be/aliu6yertgo?t=4332) allowed  
[1:12:13](https://youtu.be/aliu6yertgo?t=4333) so then i asked him out of curiosity i  
[1:12:15](https://youtu.be/aliu6yertgo?t=4335) said to him why did you convert to islam  
[1:12:18](https://youtu.be/aliu6yertgo?t=4338) i expected him to say i was an atheist i  
[1:12:20](https://youtu.be/aliu6yertgo?t=4340) was a christian that's what you get  
[1:12:22](https://youtu.be/aliu6yertgo?t=4342) he gave me a radically different answer  
[1:12:24](https://youtu.be/aliu6yertgo?t=4344) he said i was a traditional  
[1:12:26](https://youtu.be/aliu6yertgo?t=4346) english pagan i believed in the nordic  
[1:12:29](https://youtu.be/aliu6yertgo?t=4349) gods  
[1:12:30](https://youtu.be/aliu6yertgo?t=4350) and we believed in idols and amongst our  
[1:12:33](https://youtu.be/aliu6yertgo?t=4353) idols  
[1:12:34](https://youtu.be/aliu6yertgo?t=4354) we used to pray to them one day when i  
[1:12:36](https://youtu.be/aliu6yertgo?t=4356) was in my worship  
[1:12:38](https://youtu.be/aliu6yertgo?t=4358) i decided to pray to the overall supreme  
[1:12:41](https://youtu.be/aliu6yertgo?t=4361) god that they believe in  
[1:12:42](https://youtu.be/aliu6yertgo?t=4362) just like the quraish and all of these  
[1:12:44](https://youtu.be/aliu6yertgo?t=4364) gods are gods that that supreme god gave  
[1:12:46](https://youtu.be/aliu6yertgo?t=4366) permission to  
[1:12:48](https://youtu.be/aliu6yertgo?t=4368) he said that day i asked the supreme god  
[1:12:51](https://youtu.be/aliu6yertgo?t=4371) for guidance and in my heart i lost  
[1:12:55](https://youtu.be/aliu6yertgo?t=4375) all interest in these idols and after  
[1:12:58](https://youtu.be/aliu6yertgo?t=4378) that supplication to god  
[1:13:00](https://youtu.be/aliu6yertgo?t=4380) i became a firm believer that there's  
[1:13:02](https://youtu.be/aliu6yertgo?t=4382) only one god  
[1:13:04](https://youtu.be/aliu6yertgo?t=4384) then when i looked into religion i  
[1:13:06](https://youtu.be/aliu6yertgo?t=4386) recognized islam must be the truth  
[1:13:08](https://youtu.be/aliu6yertgo?t=4388) because of his strict monotheism so his  
[1:13:11](https://youtu.be/aliu6yertgo?t=4391) reason for accepting islam was  
[1:13:12](https://youtu.be/aliu6yertgo?t=4392) monotheism his reason for rejecting  
[1:13:14](https://youtu.be/aliu6yertgo?t=4394) islam possibly  
[1:13:15](https://youtu.be/aliu6yertgo?t=4395) was because he thought islam doesn't  
[1:13:17](https://youtu.be/aliu6yertgo?t=4397) teach mundians however  
[1:13:19](https://youtu.be/aliu6yertgo?t=4399) even as a mushrik he made dua  
[1:13:22](https://youtu.be/aliu6yertgo?t=4402) to the supreme god so even when it comes  
[1:13:24](https://youtu.be/aliu6yertgo?t=4404) to hindus when it comes to  
[1:13:26](https://youtu.be/aliu6yertgo?t=4406) people they are sometimes scared of the  
[1:13:27](https://youtu.be/aliu6yertgo?t=4407) word allah or even the word god with  
[1:13:29](https://youtu.be/aliu6yertgo?t=4409) hindus right  
[1:13:30](https://youtu.be/aliu6yertgo?t=4410) if you say them look ultimately you  
[1:13:32](https://youtu.be/aliu6yertgo?t=4412) believe there's one supreme who's beyond  
[1:13:35](https://youtu.be/aliu6yertgo?t=4415) everything right doesn't it make sense  
[1:13:38](https://youtu.be/aliu6yertgo?t=4418) that there's one supreme above  
[1:13:39](https://youtu.be/aliu6yertgo?t=4419) everything and all of the rest of these  
[1:13:41](https://youtu.be/aliu6yertgo?t=4421) gods are powerless  
[1:13:42](https://youtu.be/aliu6yertgo?t=4422) and sometimes it's better to use  
[1:13:46](https://youtu.be/aliu6yertgo?t=4426) this type of argument even though  
[1:13:48](https://youtu.be/aliu6yertgo?t=4428) conceptually it's the same as  
[1:13:50](https://youtu.be/aliu6yertgo?t=4430) but they're less likely to put up their  
[1:13:51](https://youtu.be/aliu6yertgo?t=4431) barriers because as soon as you mention  
[1:13:53](https://youtu.be/aliu6yertgo?t=4433) allah as soon as you mention  
[1:13:55](https://youtu.be/aliu6yertgo?t=4435) you know these types of technologies  
[1:13:56](https://youtu.be/aliu6yertgo?t=4436) they get scared because what  
[1:13:58](https://youtu.be/aliu6yertgo?t=4438) one thing which is very hard to get  
[1:14:01](https://youtu.be/aliu6yertgo?t=4441) around  
[1:14:02](https://youtu.be/aliu6yertgo?t=4442) right is that all of these polytheistic  
[1:14:04](https://youtu.be/aliu6yertgo?t=4444) religions they're on an uphill battle  
[1:14:06](https://youtu.be/aliu6yertgo?t=4446) it is so fittery is so natural to  
[1:14:09](https://youtu.be/aliu6yertgo?t=4449) believe in one supreme being  
[1:14:11](https://youtu.be/aliu6yertgo?t=4451) you know this is this is something which  
[1:14:13](https://youtu.be/aliu6yertgo?t=4453) is so hard to get out of the human  
[1:14:15](https://youtu.be/aliu6yertgo?t=4455) psyche  
[1:14:15](https://youtu.be/aliu6yertgo?t=4455) i would put it this way in terms of  
[1:14:17](https://youtu.be/aliu6yertgo?t=4457) rationally there are two arguments that  
[1:14:19](https://youtu.be/aliu6yertgo?t=4459) completely defeat polytheism and you  
[1:14:20](https://youtu.be/aliu6yertgo?t=4460) don't need more than that  
[1:14:22](https://youtu.be/aliu6yertgo?t=4462) and that includes trinitarianism  
[1:14:23](https://youtu.be/aliu6yertgo?t=4463) hinduism and sikhism all of them  
[1:14:25](https://youtu.be/aliu6yertgo?t=4465) because as we said sikhism and hinduism  
[1:14:28](https://youtu.be/aliu6yertgo?t=4468) both rely  
[1:14:29](https://youtu.be/aliu6yertgo?t=4469) for the most part and obviously there  
[1:14:30](https://youtu.be/aliu6yertgo?t=4470) are some variations and i'm being very  
[1:14:32](https://youtu.be/aliu6yertgo?t=4472) clear  
[1:14:32](https://youtu.be/aliu6yertgo?t=4472) but for the most part on pantheistic  
[1:14:34](https://youtu.be/aliu6yertgo?t=4474) notions which is for us  
[1:14:35](https://youtu.be/aliu6yertgo?t=4475) a form of polytheism by the way so what  
[1:14:37](https://youtu.be/aliu6yertgo?t=4477) we'll say is  
[1:14:39](https://youtu.be/aliu6yertgo?t=4479) there's two dalils two evidences which  
[1:14:41](https://youtu.be/aliu6yertgo?t=4481) you should acquaint yourself with  
[1:14:42](https://youtu.be/aliu6yertgo?t=4482) one of them is called which is mentioned  
[1:14:46](https://youtu.be/aliu6yertgo?t=4486) in chapter number 23 verse number 19  
[1:14:48](https://youtu.be/aliu6yertgo?t=4488) one i believe it's night one anyway it  
[1:14:50](https://youtu.be/aliu6yertgo?t=4490) could be 93 but allah he mentions  
[1:15:03](https://youtu.be/aliu6yertgo?t=4503) and he has not taken with him any god  
[1:15:06](https://youtu.be/aliu6yertgo?t=4506) if that had been the case they would  
[1:15:08](https://youtu.be/aliu6yertgo?t=4508) every single one of them would have  
[1:15:10](https://youtu.be/aliu6yertgo?t=4510) taken away what they had created and  
[1:15:12](https://youtu.be/aliu6yertgo?t=4512) that they would have tried to outstrip  
[1:15:13](https://youtu.be/aliu6yertgo?t=4513) one another  
[1:15:14](https://youtu.be/aliu6yertgo?t=4514) it makes no rational sense for them to  
[1:15:17](https://youtu.be/aliu6yertgo?t=4517) be more than one all-powerful  
[1:15:19](https://youtu.be/aliu6yertgo?t=4519) entity because if you say there's more  
[1:15:21](https://youtu.be/aliu6yertgo?t=4521) than one more powerful  
[1:15:22](https://youtu.be/aliu6yertgo?t=4522) then your they can't potentially cannot  
[1:15:25](https://youtu.be/aliu6yertgo?t=4525) be all powerful if they're not powerful  
[1:15:27](https://youtu.be/aliu6yertgo?t=4527) over the other one  
[1:15:29](https://youtu.be/aliu6yertgo?t=4529) simple as that you can't have more than  
[1:15:30](https://youtu.be/aliu6yertgo?t=4530) one more powerful you can't have one  
[1:15:32](https://youtu.be/aliu6yertgo?t=4532) supreme creator  
[1:15:33](https://youtu.be/aliu6yertgo?t=4533) and you can't have one supreme will  
[1:15:35](https://youtu.be/aliu6yertgo?t=4535) that's why allah says  
[1:15:37](https://youtu.be/aliu6yertgo?t=4537) you know  
[1:15:41](https://youtu.be/aliu6yertgo?t=4541) that had there been any gods other than  
[1:15:43](https://youtu.be/aliu6yertgo?t=4543) allah the heavens and the earth have  
[1:15:45](https://youtu.be/aliu6yertgo?t=4545) been destroyed  
[1:15:47](https://youtu.be/aliu6yertgo?t=4547) and so because you can't have one more  
[1:15:48](https://youtu.be/aliu6yertgo?t=4548) than one supreme will it's like driving  
[1:15:50](https://youtu.be/aliu6yertgo?t=4550) a car and you have two people driving  
[1:15:52](https://youtu.be/aliu6yertgo?t=4552) like where's the car gonna go it's gonna  
[1:15:54](https://youtu.be/aliu6yertgo?t=4554) go in different directions it's not  
[1:15:55](https://youtu.be/aliu6yertgo?t=4555) gonna be  
[1:15:56](https://youtu.be/aliu6yertgo?t=4556) the the uniformity of nature brings us  
[1:15:58](https://youtu.be/aliu6yertgo?t=4558) to the conclusion that you have one  
[1:16:00](https://youtu.be/aliu6yertgo?t=4560) supreme will  
[1:16:01](https://youtu.be/aliu6yertgo?t=4561) that's organizing all the things having  
[1:16:03](https://youtu.be/aliu6yertgo?t=4563) said that two uh  
[1:16:04](https://youtu.be/aliu6yertgo?t=4564) one argument which is tamannaah which is  
[1:16:06](https://youtu.be/aliu6yertgo?t=4566) the idea that you can't have one supreme  
[1:16:08](https://youtu.be/aliu6yertgo?t=4568) will power and uh creative capacity  
[1:16:12](https://youtu.be/aliu6yertgo?t=4572) you can't have more than one of those  
[1:16:14](https://youtu.be/aliu6yertgo?t=4574) and you can't have more than one  
[1:16:15](https://youtu.be/aliu6yertgo?t=4575) necessary existence if you want to add  
[1:16:17](https://youtu.be/aliu6yertgo?t=4577) that to that as well  
[1:16:18](https://youtu.be/aliu6yertgo?t=4578) right the second thing is when it comes  
[1:16:20](https://youtu.be/aliu6yertgo?t=4580) to pantheism especially and  
[1:16:24](https://youtu.be/aliu6yertgo?t=4584) then what breaks that is the deleted  
[1:16:26](https://youtu.be/aliu6yertgo?t=4586) keep or the argument from division  
[1:16:28](https://youtu.be/aliu6yertgo?t=4588) the idea that you can't have a form  
[1:16:30](https://youtu.be/aliu6yertgo?t=4590) which is generated  
[1:16:32](https://youtu.be/aliu6yertgo?t=4592) so which is made out of divisible parts  
[1:16:34](https://youtu.be/aliu6yertgo?t=4594) which can somehow  
[1:16:36](https://youtu.be/aliu6yertgo?t=4596) uh not be generated anything that is  
[1:16:38](https://youtu.be/aliu6yertgo?t=4598) made out of parts  
[1:16:39](https://youtu.be/aliu6yertgo?t=4599) is generated the universe is made out of  
[1:16:41](https://youtu.be/aliu6yertgo?t=4601) parts therefore the universe is  
[1:16:43](https://youtu.be/aliu6yertgo?t=4603) generated if you say that god belongs  
[1:16:45](https://youtu.be/aliu6yertgo?t=4605) within the universe  
[1:16:46](https://youtu.be/aliu6yertgo?t=4606) with his essence and he is generated as  
[1:16:48](https://youtu.be/aliu6yertgo?t=4608) well and that's  
[1:16:49](https://youtu.be/aliu6yertgo?t=4609) uh that would disprove the uh the idea  
[1:16:51](https://youtu.be/aliu6yertgo?t=4611) that version of god cannot exist  
[1:16:53](https://youtu.be/aliu6yertgo?t=4613) simple as that yeah  
[1:16:57](https://youtu.be/aliu6yertgo?t=4617) for your questions uh we're going to go  
[1:17:00](https://youtu.be/aliu6yertgo?t=4620) to brother  
[1:17:01](https://youtu.be/aliu6yertgo?t=4621) send you if your mic is working if not  
[1:17:04](https://youtu.be/aliu6yertgo?t=4624) then we'll go to someone else  
[1:17:10](https://youtu.be/aliu6yertgo?t=4630) send you are you there  
[1:17:14](https://youtu.be/aliu6yertgo?t=4634) we will go to brother yusuf  
[1:17:20](https://youtu.be/aliu6yertgo?t=4640) brother yusuf are you there  
[1:17:22](https://youtu.be/aliu6yertgo?t=4642) [Music]  
[1:17:26](https://youtu.be/aliu6yertgo?t=4646) can you hear me properly yes we can  
[1:17:30](https://youtu.be/aliu6yertgo?t=4650) okay how are you guys doing  
[1:17:32](https://youtu.be/aliu6yertgo?t=4652) alhamdulillah  
[1:17:33](https://youtu.be/aliu6yertgo?t=4653) how are you doing alhamdulillah um  
[1:17:36](https://youtu.be/aliu6yertgo?t=4656) i was just i wasn't actually planning on  
[1:17:39](https://youtu.be/aliu6yertgo?t=4659) asking anything specific but i was  
[1:17:42](https://youtu.be/aliu6yertgo?t=4662) i heard muhammad hijab you were talking  
[1:17:43](https://youtu.be/aliu6yertgo?t=4663) about the  
[1:17:45](https://youtu.be/aliu6yertgo?t=4665) the evil thing existing or non-existing  
[1:17:48](https://youtu.be/aliu6yertgo?t=4668) and the difference in the schools  
[1:17:52](https://youtu.be/aliu6yertgo?t=4672) etc so i  
[1:17:55](https://youtu.be/aliu6yertgo?t=4675) and i note down the book that you  
[1:17:57](https://youtu.be/aliu6yertgo?t=4677) mentioned for abner  
[1:17:59](https://youtu.be/aliu6yertgo?t=4679) i was just hoping if you can give me a  
[1:18:01](https://youtu.be/aliu6yertgo?t=4681) book for the ones that are talking about  
[1:18:03](https://youtu.be/aliu6yertgo?t=4683) an ashara al metro  
[1:18:04](https://youtu.be/aliu6yertgo?t=4684) in that issue this is a very interesting  
[1:18:07](https://youtu.be/aliu6yertgo?t=4687) subject  
[1:18:07](https://youtu.be/aliu6yertgo?t=4687) that i want to know more about yeah so  
[1:18:28](https://youtu.be/aliu6yertgo?t=4708) i remember him saying that very vividly  
[1:18:29](https://youtu.be/aliu6yertgo?t=4709) that this is not even if you like  
[1:18:31](https://youtu.be/aliu6yertgo?t=4711) it actually i'll tell you where he makes  
[1:18:33](https://youtu.be/aliu6yertgo?t=4713) he mentions this  
[1:18:36](https://youtu.be/aliu6yertgo?t=4716) he wrote a commentary on ibn cena's work  
[1:18:40](https://youtu.be/aliu6yertgo?t=4720) okay and he was surprised that he'd been  
[1:18:43](https://youtu.be/aliu6yertgo?t=4723) seen that  
[1:18:44](https://youtu.be/aliu6yertgo?t=4724) dealt with the problem of evil because  
[1:18:46](https://youtu.be/aliu6yertgo?t=4726) he said like the philosopher  
[1:18:48](https://youtu.be/aliu6yertgo?t=4728) are well known to work from first  
[1:18:49](https://youtu.be/aliu6yertgo?t=4729) principles and so far  
[1:18:51](https://youtu.be/aliu6yertgo?t=4731) he said like this is not even an issue  
[1:18:53](https://youtu.be/aliu6yertgo?t=4733) because it's not something which we can  
[1:18:54](https://youtu.be/aliu6yertgo?t=4734) prove or disprove from first principles  
[1:18:56](https://youtu.be/aliu6yertgo?t=4736) but he he did it in one of the hats of  
[1:18:59](https://youtu.be/aliu6yertgo?t=4739) even seen as  
[1:19:00](https://youtu.be/aliu6yertgo?t=4740) i i don't think it's because that  
[1:19:03](https://youtu.be/aliu6yertgo?t=4743) particular kitab has  
[1:19:05](https://youtu.be/aliu6yertgo?t=4745) uh even though i think i don't think  
[1:19:08](https://youtu.be/aliu6yertgo?t=4748) that's  
[1:19:08](https://youtu.be/aliu6yertgo?t=4748) particularly the one but uh we'll have  
[1:19:12](https://youtu.be/aliu6yertgo?t=4752) to check  
[1:19:12](https://youtu.be/aliu6yertgo?t=4752) which book for the where dean in  
[1:19:15](https://youtu.be/aliu6yertgo?t=4755) particular  
[1:19:16](https://youtu.be/aliu6yertgo?t=4756) um talks about that now other scholars  
[1:19:20](https://youtu.be/aliu6yertgo?t=4760) like  
[1:19:25](https://youtu.be/aliu6yertgo?t=4765) i think the most well developed theodicy  
[1:19:27](https://youtu.be/aliu6yertgo?t=4767) from a national perspective  
[1:19:29](https://youtu.be/aliu6yertgo?t=4769) so definitely check him out in terms of  
[1:19:32](https://youtu.be/aliu6yertgo?t=4772) uh  
[1:19:32](https://youtu.be/aliu6yertgo?t=4772) al-qaeda from the matasil school  
[1:19:36](https://youtu.be/aliu6yertgo?t=4776) he mentions this in his hamsa he  
[1:19:39](https://youtu.be/aliu6yertgo?t=4779) mentions this in his  
[1:19:40](https://youtu.be/aliu6yertgo?t=4780) hamsa uh he mentions this in his book  
[1:19:43](https://youtu.be/aliu6yertgo?t=4783) where he talks about the adal because  
[1:19:45](https://youtu.be/aliu6yertgo?t=4785) remember they believe in five things  
[1:19:46](https://youtu.be/aliu6yertgo?t=4786) there's five  
[1:19:48](https://youtu.be/aliu6yertgo?t=4788) like us all of them tesla uh school of  
[1:19:50](https://youtu.be/aliu6yertgo?t=4790) thought  
[1:19:51](https://youtu.be/aliu6yertgo?t=4791) and one of them is adil and obviously  
[1:19:52](https://youtu.be/aliu6yertgo?t=4792) that connects to  
[1:19:54](https://youtu.be/aliu6yertgo?t=4794) and he's also got another book which i  
[1:19:56](https://youtu.be/aliu6yertgo?t=4796) forget what the name of it is but it's  
[1:19:57](https://youtu.be/aliu6yertgo?t=4797) also mentioned  
[1:19:58](https://youtu.be/aliu6yertgo?t=4798) i can't remember but um it's another  
[1:20:01](https://youtu.be/aliu6yertgo?t=4801) book  
[1:20:01](https://youtu.be/aliu6yertgo?t=4801) which is also been published is one of  
[1:20:04](https://youtu.be/aliu6yertgo?t=4804) those things but  
[1:20:04](https://youtu.be/aliu6yertgo?t=4804) there's another one which i'm completely  
[1:20:06](https://youtu.be/aliu6yertgo?t=4806) forgetting for the sake of argument now  
[1:20:11](https://youtu.be/aliu6yertgo?t=4811) is the guy go to guy is  
[1:20:14](https://youtu.be/aliu6yertgo?t=4814) for the martesli movement he is the  
[1:20:16](https://youtu.be/aliu6yertgo?t=4816) representative he's the  
[1:20:18](https://youtu.be/aliu6yertgo?t=4818) living the one representation of  
[1:20:20](https://youtu.be/aliu6yertgo?t=4820) mortezalism which his works has have  
[1:20:22](https://youtu.be/aliu6yertgo?t=4822) remained  
[1:20:23](https://youtu.be/aliu6yertgo?t=4823) with us uh so we talked about yeah the  
[1:20:26](https://youtu.be/aliu6yertgo?t=4826) the maturity yeah so you you look at  
[1:20:29](https://youtu.be/aliu6yertgo?t=4829) someone like  
[1:20:30](https://youtu.be/aliu6yertgo?t=4830) ignore man or something like that he  
[1:20:32](https://youtu.be/aliu6yertgo?t=4832) spoke about kadalkata and scored written  
[1:20:34](https://youtu.be/aliu6yertgo?t=4834) books and stuff you know  
[1:20:35](https://youtu.be/aliu6yertgo?t=4835) that's why i would go bro like you know  
[1:20:37](https://youtu.be/aliu6yertgo?t=4837) and uh actually or for an english  
[1:20:39](https://youtu.be/aliu6yertgo?t=4839) resource  
[1:20:40](https://youtu.be/aliu6yertgo?t=4840) sherman jackson's written something  
[1:20:41](https://youtu.be/aliu6yertgo?t=4841) called black death  
[1:20:43](https://youtu.be/aliu6yertgo?t=4843) where she actually enumerates all of  
[1:20:44](https://youtu.be/aliu6yertgo?t=4844) these opinions in english language it's  
[1:20:46](https://youtu.be/aliu6yertgo?t=4846) pretty good book actually i'll start  
[1:20:47](https://youtu.be/aliu6yertgo?t=4847) with that  
[1:20:48](https://youtu.be/aliu6yertgo?t=4848) it's called black death or something  
[1:20:49](https://youtu.be/aliu6yertgo?t=4849) like that and he talks about the  
[1:20:51](https://youtu.be/aliu6yertgo?t=4851) sherman jackson he talks about all the  
[1:20:53](https://youtu.be/aliu6yertgo?t=4853) different schools i don't think he he  
[1:20:54](https://youtu.be/aliu6yertgo?t=4854) does a really good job with the  
[1:20:55](https://youtu.be/aliu6yertgo?t=4855) actualities and the thing  
[1:20:56](https://youtu.be/aliu6yertgo?t=4856) but he doesn't do as good a job in my  
[1:20:58](https://youtu.be/aliu6yertgo?t=4858) opinion of imitamia he does try and i  
[1:21:00](https://youtu.be/aliu6yertgo?t=4860) knew his opinion as well  
[1:21:04](https://youtu.be/aliu6yertgo?t=4864) but there was something that you  
[1:21:05](https://youtu.be/aliu6yertgo?t=4865) mentioned also about the  
[1:21:08](https://youtu.be/aliu6yertgo?t=4868) raping the child yes and how  
[1:21:12](https://youtu.be/aliu6yertgo?t=4872) i mean i would think that if if  
[1:21:15](https://youtu.be/aliu6yertgo?t=4875) presumably of course if allah said that  
[1:21:17](https://youtu.be/aliu6yertgo?t=4877) would be moral than it would be  
[1:21:19](https://youtu.be/aliu6yertgo?t=4879) yeah well this is the thing a lot in the  
[1:21:21](https://youtu.be/aliu6yertgo?t=4881) law  
[1:21:24](https://youtu.be/aliu6yertgo?t=4884) but then again wouldn't allah define  
[1:21:26](https://youtu.be/aliu6yertgo?t=4886) what a fascia  
[1:21:39](https://youtu.be/aliu6yertgo?t=4899) that's what it means that means they're  
[1:21:41](https://youtu.be/aliu6yertgo?t=4901) speaking in tautologies  
[1:21:42](https://youtu.be/aliu6yertgo?t=4902) that would make no sense so it would it  
[1:21:44](https://youtu.be/aliu6yertgo?t=4904) must mean that al-fatiha is something  
[1:21:46](https://youtu.be/aliu6yertgo?t=4906) out there  
[1:21:46](https://youtu.be/aliu6yertgo?t=4906) which allah yeah that's why  
[1:21:50](https://youtu.be/aliu6yertgo?t=4910) that's my conclusion of the ayah because  
[1:21:51](https://youtu.be/aliu6yertgo?t=4911) it will be trying to  
[1:21:53](https://youtu.be/aliu6yertgo?t=4913) say about it's like saying allah does  
[1:21:55](https://youtu.be/aliu6yertgo?t=4915) not command to that which she does not  
[1:21:57](https://youtu.be/aliu6yertgo?t=4917) command you  
[1:21:58](https://youtu.be/aliu6yertgo?t=4918) makes no sense does it yes  
[1:22:01](https://youtu.be/aliu6yertgo?t=4921) it does not yeah you're right have i  
[1:22:03](https://youtu.be/aliu6yertgo?t=4923) changed your mind on that  
[1:22:06](https://youtu.be/aliu6yertgo?t=4926) i'm a fair person i'd like to think so  
[1:22:08](https://youtu.be/aliu6yertgo?t=4928) you see this is the reason  
[1:22:10](https://youtu.be/aliu6yertgo?t=4930) [Laughter]  
[1:22:12](https://youtu.be/aliu6yertgo?t=4932) you see what comes with people's minds  
[1:22:14](https://youtu.be/aliu6yertgo?t=4934) as you come onto the show you get change  
[1:22:16](https://youtu.be/aliu6yertgo?t=4936) your mind  
[1:22:16](https://youtu.be/aliu6yertgo?t=4936) yeah i'm only kidding no no  
[1:22:20](https://youtu.be/aliu6yertgo?t=4940) no no i thought about this it was  
[1:22:22](https://youtu.be/aliu6yertgo?t=4942) something i was thinking about for some  
[1:22:23](https://youtu.be/aliu6yertgo?t=4943) time  
[1:22:24](https://youtu.be/aliu6yertgo?t=4944) i i think sorry and the martezilies are  
[1:22:28](https://youtu.be/aliu6yertgo?t=4948) more right than escalating  
[1:22:30](https://youtu.be/aliu6yertgo?t=4950) so then how would you define fascia  
[1:22:34](https://youtu.be/aliu6yertgo?t=4954) oh yeah it's things which are evil  
[1:22:38](https://youtu.be/aliu6yertgo?t=4958) basically  
[1:22:40](https://youtu.be/aliu6yertgo?t=4960) yeah how would you know how would you  
[1:22:42](https://youtu.be/aliu6yertgo?t=4962) know we have to look at dictionary  
[1:22:44](https://youtu.be/aliu6yertgo?t=4964) for if you wanted uh i can't remember  
[1:22:47](https://youtu.be/aliu6yertgo?t=4967) anything on the top of my head  
[1:22:48](https://youtu.be/aliu6yertgo?t=4968) no i didn't mean like a tariff of the  
[1:22:50](https://youtu.be/aliu6yertgo?t=4970) word but how would you know which is  
[1:22:52](https://youtu.be/aliu6yertgo?t=4972) bad bad and which is bad that you think  
[1:22:56](https://youtu.be/aliu6yertgo?t=4976) it's bad but it's not actually bad  
[1:22:59](https://youtu.be/aliu6yertgo?t=4979) no you don't know that a lot that's why  
[1:23:01](https://youtu.be/aliu6yertgo?t=4981) you've been telling me he answers this  
[1:23:02](https://youtu.be/aliu6yertgo?t=4982) question actually  
[1:23:03](https://youtu.be/aliu6yertgo?t=4983) because he they asked him about this  
[1:23:05](https://youtu.be/aliu6yertgo?t=4985) question and he mentioned this  
[1:23:08](https://youtu.be/aliu6yertgo?t=4988) he mentions this in one of his uh i  
[1:23:10](https://youtu.be/aliu6yertgo?t=4990) think the first two or three volumes or  
[1:23:12](https://youtu.be/aliu6yertgo?t=4992) something  
[1:23:13](https://youtu.be/aliu6yertgo?t=4993) they asked them how do you know if it's  
[1:23:14](https://youtu.be/aliu6yertgo?t=4994) fit three and you know these things  
[1:23:16](https://youtu.be/aliu6yertgo?t=4996) how do you why do you even need  
[1:23:17](https://youtu.be/aliu6yertgo?t=4997) revelation he said because socialization  
[1:23:19](https://youtu.be/aliu6yertgo?t=4999) is so strong  
[1:23:20](https://youtu.be/aliu6yertgo?t=5000) that you won't be able to differentiate  
[1:23:21](https://youtu.be/aliu6yertgo?t=5001) between that which is socialized  
[1:23:23](https://youtu.be/aliu6yertgo?t=5003) and that which you think you know from  
[1:23:25](https://youtu.be/aliu6yertgo?t=5005) instinct so this is a real problem and  
[1:23:27](https://youtu.be/aliu6yertgo?t=5007) that's why you always need and that's  
[1:23:28](https://youtu.be/aliu6yertgo?t=5008) what jay mackey wrote i i've found this  
[1:23:30](https://youtu.be/aliu6yertgo?t=5010) book i had  
[1:23:31](https://youtu.be/aliu6yertgo?t=5011) good good notes on it jay mackey  
[1:23:34](https://youtu.be/aliu6yertgo?t=5014) is is one of the major people of ethics  
[1:23:36](https://youtu.be/aliu6yertgo?t=5016) and at the end of his book he mentions  
[1:23:38](https://youtu.be/aliu6yertgo?t=5018) very good book yeah i think it's just  
[1:23:40](https://youtu.be/aliu6yertgo?t=5020) called  
[1:23:41](https://youtu.be/aliu6yertgo?t=5021) that the book is perfect at the end of  
[1:23:43](https://youtu.be/aliu6yertgo?t=5023) the book he said he's basically reading  
[1:23:45](https://youtu.be/aliu6yertgo?t=5025) something called error theory  
[1:23:46](https://youtu.be/aliu6yertgo?t=5026) and at the end of the book he says  
[1:23:48](https://youtu.be/aliu6yertgo?t=5028) basically uh he so basically does not  
[1:23:50](https://youtu.be/aliu6yertgo?t=5030) believe in objective morality  
[1:23:52](https://youtu.be/aliu6yertgo?t=5032) uh he is an atheist okay but he said  
[1:23:54](https://youtu.be/aliu6yertgo?t=5034) that the only  
[1:23:55](https://youtu.be/aliu6yertgo?t=5035) he he admits to the only way the  
[1:23:58](https://youtu.be/aliu6yertgo?t=5038) grounding problem can be solved  
[1:23:59](https://youtu.be/aliu6yertgo?t=5039) is through a god basically and he said  
[1:24:02](https://youtu.be/aliu6yertgo?t=5042) he said it would be  
[1:24:04](https://youtu.be/aliu6yertgo?t=5044) gratuitous this is the word he uses  
[1:24:06](https://youtu.be/aliu6yertgo?t=5046) right it will be gratuitous  
[1:24:07](https://youtu.be/aliu6yertgo?t=5047) for a theist to think that they can have  
[1:24:10](https://youtu.be/aliu6yertgo?t=5050) a list  
[1:24:11](https://youtu.be/aliu6yertgo?t=5051) of commandments okay which and he says  
[1:24:14](https://youtu.be/aliu6yertgo?t=5054) it's near the end of the book  
[1:24:15](https://youtu.be/aliu6yertgo?t=5055) that basically would outline what  
[1:24:17](https://youtu.be/aliu6yertgo?t=5057) morality is without  
[1:24:19](https://youtu.be/aliu6yertgo?t=5059) a revelation and i was very astounded by  
[1:24:21](https://youtu.be/aliu6yertgo?t=5061) him saying that because i found that  
[1:24:22](https://youtu.be/aliu6yertgo?t=5062) it's exactly true  
[1:24:23](https://youtu.be/aliu6yertgo?t=5063) in order for us to be guided we need the  
[1:24:25](https://youtu.be/aliu6yertgo?t=5065) guidance  
[1:24:26](https://youtu.be/aliu6yertgo?t=5066) okay and that's why we believe in allah  
[1:24:29](https://youtu.be/aliu6yertgo?t=5069) he is the all-knowing one he sends books  
[1:24:31](https://youtu.be/aliu6yertgo?t=5071) and it makes sense that he sends books  
[1:24:33](https://youtu.be/aliu6yertgo?t=5073) to outline to us in very clear  
[1:24:35](https://youtu.be/aliu6yertgo?t=5075) language what we need to do what we  
[1:24:37](https://youtu.be/aliu6yertgo?t=5077) can't do and that is the best way for us  
[1:24:39](https://youtu.be/aliu6yertgo?t=5079) to understand morality  
[1:24:41](https://youtu.be/aliu6yertgo?t=5081) even if things like seem on the face of  
[1:24:43](https://youtu.be/aliu6yertgo?t=5083) it  
[1:24:44](https://youtu.be/aliu6yertgo?t=5084) when i was young 13 14 and i was  
[1:24:46](https://youtu.be/aliu6yertgo?t=5086) starting to try getting into the deen  
[1:24:49](https://youtu.be/aliu6yertgo?t=5089) i had for the first time looked at  
[1:24:50](https://youtu.be/aliu6yertgo?t=5090) bukhari and muslim and read it and  
[1:24:52](https://youtu.be/aliu6yertgo?t=5092) thought  
[1:24:53](https://youtu.be/aliu6yertgo?t=5093) wow this is a bit unusual i'll be honest  
[1:24:54](https://youtu.be/aliu6yertgo?t=5094) with you that's what i was saying to  
[1:24:55](https://youtu.be/aliu6yertgo?t=5095) myself i read the quran for okay i  
[1:24:57](https://youtu.be/aliu6yertgo?t=5097) understand but when i started looking at  
[1:24:58](https://youtu.be/aliu6yertgo?t=5098) the hadith  
[1:24:59](https://youtu.be/aliu6yertgo?t=5099) i thought it was very unusual because i  
[1:25:01](https://youtu.be/aliu6yertgo?t=5101) was brought up in the west  
[1:25:03](https://youtu.be/aliu6yertgo?t=5103) you get it so when i saw spitting on  
[1:25:05](https://youtu.be/aliu6yertgo?t=5105) your left side and you know  
[1:25:07](https://youtu.be/aliu6yertgo?t=5107) eating the lizards and you know this  
[1:25:09](https://youtu.be/aliu6yertgo?t=5109) thing that you find in the hadith you  
[1:25:10](https://youtu.be/aliu6yertgo?t=5110) get what i'm trying to say  
[1:25:11](https://youtu.be/aliu6yertgo?t=5111) even though the prophet didn't eat the  
[1:25:12](https://youtu.be/aliu6yertgo?t=5112) lizard but he was presented with it and  
[1:25:14](https://youtu.be/aliu6yertgo?t=5114) food and this and nine wives at one time  
[1:25:16](https://youtu.be/aliu6yertgo?t=5116) and  
[1:25:16](https://youtu.be/aliu6yertgo?t=5116) all these calamba like i thought what's  
[1:25:18](https://youtu.be/aliu6yertgo?t=5118) this it's a bit unusual  
[1:25:20](https://youtu.be/aliu6yertgo?t=5120) but then you started realizing that i  
[1:25:22](https://youtu.be/aliu6yertgo?t=5122) asked myself the question and i remember  
[1:25:24](https://youtu.be/aliu6yertgo?t=5124) i was in egypt alexandria for the summer  
[1:25:26](https://youtu.be/aliu6yertgo?t=5126) holiday with my mom  
[1:25:28](https://youtu.be/aliu6yertgo?t=5128) and i was going through this bukhari  
[1:25:30](https://youtu.be/aliu6yertgo?t=5130) muslim and i asked myself a question  
[1:25:32](https://youtu.be/aliu6yertgo?t=5132) i said to myself why do i think this is  
[1:25:34](https://youtu.be/aliu6yertgo?t=5134) weird and i was 13 at the time and i  
[1:25:36](https://youtu.be/aliu6yertgo?t=5136) look back now  
[1:25:37](https://youtu.be/aliu6yertgo?t=5137) 16 years later i think that was a good  
[1:25:39](https://youtu.be/aliu6yertgo?t=5139) question the reason why i think it's  
[1:25:40](https://youtu.be/aliu6yertgo?t=5140) weird because i was born and raised in a  
[1:25:42](https://youtu.be/aliu6yertgo?t=5142) certain time which that's  
[1:25:44](https://youtu.be/aliu6yertgo?t=5144) unusual to me so i have to now take if i  
[1:25:47](https://youtu.be/aliu6yertgo?t=5147) believe that these books are wahi from  
[1:25:49](https://youtu.be/aliu6yertgo?t=5149) allah  
[1:25:50](https://youtu.be/aliu6yertgo?t=5150) i have to now reassess my understanding  
[1:25:52](https://youtu.be/aliu6yertgo?t=5152) of weirdness aesthetic  
[1:25:54](https://youtu.be/aliu6yertgo?t=5154) aesthetically pleasing right and wrong  
[1:25:56](https://youtu.be/aliu6yertgo?t=5156) in line with this book  
[1:25:58](https://youtu.be/aliu6yertgo?t=5158) the fact that i find this way it means  
[1:26:00](https://youtu.be/aliu6yertgo?t=5160) that i'm weird basically i  
[1:26:01](https://youtu.be/aliu6yertgo?t=5161) came to that conclusion at a very young  
[1:26:03](https://youtu.be/aliu6yertgo?t=5163) age so socialization is a very strong  
[1:26:05](https://youtu.be/aliu6yertgo?t=5165) thing  
[1:26:06](https://youtu.be/aliu6yertgo?t=5166) okay and we have to be very weary of it  
[1:26:08](https://youtu.be/aliu6yertgo?t=5168) so in terms of  
[1:26:09](https://youtu.be/aliu6yertgo?t=5169) finding out what the moral reality is  
[1:26:12](https://youtu.be/aliu6yertgo?t=5172) from what is not  
[1:26:13](https://youtu.be/aliu6yertgo?t=5173) we can't do that we need revelation  
[1:26:17](https://youtu.be/aliu6yertgo?t=5177) interesting okay that was  
[1:26:20](https://youtu.be/aliu6yertgo?t=5180) my only question inshallah take care my  
[1:26:23](https://youtu.be/aliu6yertgo?t=5183) friend

[1:27:24](https://youtu.be/aliu6yertgo?t=5244) it's just a question that i was  
[1:27:26](https://youtu.be/aliu6yertgo?t=5246) wondering i came across a difference of  
[1:27:27](https://youtu.be/aliu6yertgo?t=5247) opinion  
[1:27:28](https://youtu.be/aliu6yertgo?t=5248) regarding writing reference style  
[1:27:33](https://youtu.be/aliu6yertgo?t=5253) [Music]  
[1:27:48](https://youtu.be/aliu6yertgo?t=5268) yeah yeah yeah so there are two opinions  
[1:27:51](https://youtu.be/aliu6yertgo?t=5271) um  
[1:27:52](https://youtu.be/aliu6yertgo?t=5272) one opinion is by el nino where he says  
[1:27:56](https://youtu.be/aliu6yertgo?t=5276) that  
[1:27:57](https://youtu.be/aliu6yertgo?t=5277) cough or the the little in general  
[1:28:01](https://youtu.be/aliu6yertgo?t=5281) they're at their highest level of the  
[1:28:03](https://youtu.be/aliu6yertgo?t=5283) when they're after an  
[1:28:04](https://youtu.be/aliu6yertgo?t=5284) alif okay and then  
[1:28:08](https://youtu.be/aliu6yertgo?t=5288) there is another scholar who uh who is  
[1:28:11](https://youtu.be/aliu6yertgo?t=5291) before him  
[1:28:12](https://youtu.be/aliu6yertgo?t=5292) you mean  
[1:28:26](https://youtu.be/aliu6yertgo?t=5306) the the i meant the pronunciation of the  
[1:28:29](https://youtu.be/aliu6yertgo?t=5309) cough would be extremely  
[1:28:31](https://youtu.be/aliu6yertgo?t=5311) rather than it being after an effect  
[1:28:37](https://youtu.be/aliu6yertgo?t=5317) you get what i'm trying to say say that  
[1:28:38](https://youtu.be/aliu6yertgo?t=5318) against me if the cough had an  
[1:28:41](https://youtu.be/aliu6yertgo?t=5321) alif after it the pronunciation of the  
[1:28:44](https://youtu.be/aliu6yertgo?t=5324) kaf  
[1:28:45](https://youtu.be/aliu6yertgo?t=5325) not kolkafi is more mufacham  
[1:28:52](https://youtu.be/aliu6yertgo?t=5332) yeah if i had an alif after it but if  
[1:28:54](https://youtu.be/aliu6yertgo?t=5334) the  
[1:29:08](https://youtu.be/aliu6yertgo?t=5348) and the way to do not has preserved and  
[1:29:11](https://youtu.be/aliu6yertgo?t=5351) hack  
[1:29:11](https://youtu.be/aliu6yertgo?t=5351) and the prophecies themselves saying  
[1:29:16](https://youtu.be/aliu6yertgo?t=5356) shouldn't we know how properly how  
[1:29:20](https://youtu.be/aliu6yertgo?t=5360) these letters are being pronounced at  
[1:29:22](https://youtu.be/aliu6yertgo?t=5362) different what is  
[1:29:55](https://youtu.be/aliu6yertgo?t=5395) [Music]  
[1:29:58](https://youtu.be/aliu6yertgo?t=5398) the question is there are two different  
[1:30:00](https://youtu.be/aliu6yertgo?t=5400) things which are differences  
[1:30:02](https://youtu.be/aliu6yertgo?t=5402) okay there are what you call us li  
[1:30:04](https://youtu.be/aliu6yertgo?t=5404) differences  
[1:30:05](https://youtu.be/aliu6yertgo?t=5405) in the differences okay these are the  
[1:30:08](https://youtu.be/aliu6yertgo?t=5408) two particles of difference the lastly  
[1:30:10](https://youtu.be/aliu6yertgo?t=5410) differences  
[1:30:11](https://youtu.be/aliu6yertgo?t=5411) are the the differences in tattooid  
[1:30:13](https://youtu.be/aliu6yertgo?t=5413) rules like for example  
[1:30:15](https://youtu.be/aliu6yertgo?t=5415) you mentioned path okay is the kaf is it  
[1:30:33](https://youtu.be/aliu6yertgo?t=5433) yes i think that this is is this is uh  
[1:30:36](https://youtu.be/aliu6yertgo?t=5436) it's uh yes so you will say oh  
[1:30:41](https://youtu.be/aliu6yertgo?t=5441) like you put the you put the fat on the  
[1:30:44](https://youtu.be/aliu6yertgo?t=5444) heart  
[1:30:45](https://youtu.be/aliu6yertgo?t=5445) in one karat but the other  
[1:31:00](https://youtu.be/aliu6yertgo?t=5460) is  
[1:31:14](https://youtu.be/aliu6yertgo?t=5474) now the question is does this change the  
[1:31:16](https://youtu.be/aliu6yertgo?t=5476) meanings no the question is did the  
[1:31:18](https://youtu.be/aliu6yertgo?t=5478) prophet muhammad sallallahu  
[1:31:19](https://youtu.be/aliu6yertgo?t=5479) alaihi wasallam when he was reading the  
[1:31:22](https://youtu.be/aliu6yertgo?t=5482) quran okay when he was reading the quran  
[1:31:24](https://youtu.be/aliu6yertgo?t=5484) right  
[1:31:25](https://youtu.be/aliu6yertgo?t=5485) obviously he didn't read it in the book  
[1:31:26](https://youtu.be/aliu6yertgo?t=5486) when he read it did he  
[1:31:29](https://youtu.be/aliu6yertgo?t=5489) in every word of every page of the quran  
[1:31:33](https://youtu.be/aliu6yertgo?t=5493) implement every single one of those  
[1:31:36](https://youtu.be/aliu6yertgo?t=5496) differences  
[1:31:38](https://youtu.be/aliu6yertgo?t=5498) i say it's you could say that but it's  
[1:31:41](https://youtu.be/aliu6yertgo?t=5501) unreasonable to say that  
[1:31:43](https://youtu.be/aliu6yertgo?t=5503) what's more reasonable to say is that  
[1:31:44](https://youtu.be/aliu6yertgo?t=5504) it's maki so the prophet muhammed  
[1:31:47](https://youtu.be/aliu6yertgo?t=5507) in in one chapter of the quran right he  
[1:31:50](https://youtu.be/aliu6yertgo?t=5510) could have implemented  
[1:31:53](https://youtu.be/aliu6yertgo?t=5513) and so for the heart and maybe he didn't  
[1:31:55](https://youtu.be/aliu6yertgo?t=5515) so there's two principles we have in  
[1:31:57](https://youtu.be/aliu6yertgo?t=5517) place you can  
[1:31:58](https://youtu.be/aliu6yertgo?t=5518) sometimes implement the for the heart  
[1:32:00](https://youtu.be/aliu6yertgo?t=5520) and you don't implement that  
[1:32:02](https://youtu.be/aliu6yertgo?t=5522) now it's all the prophet had to do is it  
[1:32:06](https://youtu.be/aliu6yertgo?t=5526) he had to do it one time for there to be  
[1:32:08](https://youtu.be/aliu6yertgo?t=5528) a class on it  
[1:32:09](https://youtu.be/aliu6yertgo?t=5529) so in other words the  
[1:32:12](https://youtu.be/aliu6yertgo?t=5532) which is tajweed  
[1:32:15](https://youtu.be/aliu6yertgo?t=5535) they only need to be said once like for  
[1:32:18](https://youtu.be/aliu6yertgo?t=5538) example  
[1:32:19](https://youtu.be/aliu6yertgo?t=5539) like the email at of uh for example  
[1:32:22](https://youtu.be/aliu6yertgo?t=5542) watch or whatever or the  
[1:32:23](https://youtu.be/aliu6yertgo?t=5543) met battle of six rather than four oh  
[1:32:26](https://youtu.be/aliu6yertgo?t=5546) uh which is four or six points it says  
[1:32:29](https://youtu.be/aliu6yertgo?t=5549) six halacat  
[1:32:30](https://youtu.be/aliu6yertgo?t=5550) all of those things the prophet didn't  
[1:32:31](https://youtu.be/aliu6yertgo?t=5551) have to read the whole quran with them  
[1:32:33](https://youtu.be/aliu6yertgo?t=5553) it's a big it could be a misconception  
[1:32:36](https://youtu.be/aliu6yertgo?t=5556) it's not against the preservation quran  
[1:32:38](https://youtu.be/aliu6yertgo?t=5558) narrative to say  
[1:32:39](https://youtu.be/aliu6yertgo?t=5559) that the prophet muhammad all he had to  
[1:32:41](https://youtu.be/aliu6yertgo?t=5561) do is that one time he didn't need to  
[1:32:42](https://youtu.be/aliu6yertgo?t=5562) read  
[1:32:43](https://youtu.be/aliu6yertgo?t=5563) with the rules of tajweed according to  
[1:32:45](https://youtu.be/aliu6yertgo?t=5565) all  
[1:32:46](https://youtu.be/aliu6yertgo?t=5566) of the art in one way throughout from  
[1:32:49](https://youtu.be/aliu6yertgo?t=5569) fatihatis all he had to do  
[1:32:51](https://youtu.be/aliu6yertgo?t=5571) was demonstrate that you can do x with  
[1:32:53](https://youtu.be/aliu6yertgo?t=5573) heart and y with  
[1:32:54](https://youtu.be/aliu6yertgo?t=5574) heart and then and then one card it will  
[1:32:56](https://youtu.be/aliu6yertgo?t=5576) it will do  
[1:32:57](https://youtu.be/aliu6yertgo?t=5577) choose one way to do it and be  
[1:32:58](https://youtu.be/aliu6yertgo?t=5578) consistent with it and the other card it  
[1:33:00](https://youtu.be/aliu6yertgo?t=5580) will choose another way and be  
[1:33:01](https://youtu.be/aliu6yertgo?t=5581) consistent with it  
[1:33:02](https://youtu.be/aliu6yertgo?t=5582) so long as it has precedent from the  
[1:33:04](https://youtu.be/aliu6yertgo?t=5584) prophet muhammed  
[1:33:06](https://youtu.be/aliu6yertgo?t=5586) that's how they worked that's how they  
[1:33:07](https://youtu.be/aliu6yertgo?t=5587) work that's why you'll find that the  
[1:33:09](https://youtu.be/aliu6yertgo?t=5589) tajweed rules in usual i can be  
[1:33:11](https://youtu.be/aliu6yertgo?t=5591) different  
[1:33:12](https://youtu.be/aliu6yertgo?t=5592) but it doesn't mean that because someone  
[1:33:13](https://youtu.be/aliu6yertgo?t=5593) will say what did the prophet really  
[1:33:14](https://youtu.be/aliu6yertgo?t=5594) start from fattah hatunas  
[1:33:16](https://youtu.be/aliu6yertgo?t=5596) doing this and doing that and allah and  
[1:33:19](https://youtu.be/aliu6yertgo?t=5599) this and  
[1:33:20](https://youtu.be/aliu6yertgo?t=5600) the no we're not saying that  
[1:33:23](https://youtu.be/aliu6yertgo?t=5603) he only had to do it once like that for  
[1:33:25](https://youtu.be/aliu6yertgo?t=5605) each of the variations and then  
[1:33:27](https://youtu.be/aliu6yertgo?t=5607) cast then there's some sort of the card  
[1:33:30](https://youtu.be/aliu6yertgo?t=5610) he can choose whatever he likes to do  
[1:33:32](https://youtu.be/aliu6yertgo?t=5612) and there's nothing wrong with that  
[1:33:33](https://youtu.be/aliu6yertgo?t=5613) because it doesn't even change the  
[1:33:33](https://youtu.be/aliu6yertgo?t=5613) meaning  
[1:33:34](https://youtu.be/aliu6yertgo?t=5614) as now so we said there's two categories  
[1:33:36](https://youtu.be/aliu6yertgo?t=5616) there's also and then there's  
[1:33:38](https://youtu.be/aliu6yertgo?t=5618) um the the fashion  
[1:33:41](https://youtu.be/aliu6yertgo?t=5621) is where you do find difference of a  
[1:33:43](https://youtu.be/aliu6yertgo?t=5623) difference of meanings so to integrate  
[1:33:45](https://youtu.be/aliu6yertgo?t=5625) and  
[1:33:46](https://youtu.be/aliu6yertgo?t=5626) and in in in dots in in  
[1:33:58](https://youtu.be/aliu6yertgo?t=5638) there's only 600 of them okay there's  
[1:34:00](https://youtu.be/aliu6yertgo?t=5640) only 600 of such  
[1:34:02](https://youtu.be/aliu6yertgo?t=5642) words which there's difference okay 600  
[1:34:04](https://youtu.be/aliu6yertgo?t=5644) the quran is made up of 77 000 words  
[1:34:07](https://youtu.be/aliu6yertgo?t=5647) 77 000 words now how reasonable is it or  
[1:34:11](https://youtu.be/aliu6yertgo?t=5651) unreasonable  
[1:34:12](https://youtu.be/aliu6yertgo?t=5652) to say in 600 of those instances the  
[1:34:14](https://youtu.be/aliu6yertgo?t=5654) prophet muhammad gave you  
[1:34:16](https://youtu.be/aliu6yertgo?t=5656) two ways of saying it according to  
[1:34:17](https://youtu.be/aliu6yertgo?t=5657) jibril and according to that i think  
[1:34:19](https://youtu.be/aliu6yertgo?t=5659) that's very reasonable  
[1:34:20](https://youtu.be/aliu6yertgo?t=5660) so the real issue is not with that the  
[1:34:23](https://youtu.be/aliu6yertgo?t=5663) issue is with the  
[1:34:24](https://youtu.be/aliu6yertgo?t=5664) uh or with the the things which change  
[1:34:27](https://youtu.be/aliu6yertgo?t=5667) the meaning  
[1:34:28](https://youtu.be/aliu6yertgo?t=5668) and with that there's only 600 such  
[1:34:30](https://youtu.be/aliu6yertgo?t=5670) examples of 77 000. now if someone has a  
[1:34:32](https://youtu.be/aliu6yertgo?t=5672) calculator  
[1:34:33](https://youtu.be/aliu6yertgo?t=5673) they'll do 600 divided by 77 000 times  
[1:34:35](https://youtu.be/aliu6yertgo?t=5675) 100  
[1:34:36](https://youtu.be/aliu6yertgo?t=5676) and you'll get less than one percent so  
[1:34:38](https://youtu.be/aliu6yertgo?t=5678) we're talking about is  
[1:34:39](https://youtu.be/aliu6yertgo?t=5679) why is it such a monster for people to  
[1:34:41](https://youtu.be/aliu6yertgo?t=5681) think well the prophet can say  
[1:34:44](https://youtu.be/aliu6yertgo?t=5684) in in this whole quran of 77 000 words  
[1:34:46](https://youtu.be/aliu6yertgo?t=5686) and whether i get this number of 600  
[1:34:48](https://youtu.be/aliu6yertgo?t=5688) the 600 number comes from uh who wrote  
[1:34:51](https://youtu.be/aliu6yertgo?t=5691) the  
[1:34:52](https://youtu.be/aliu6yertgo?t=5692) muslim scholarly authority right  
[1:34:56](https://youtu.be/aliu6yertgo?t=5696) a huge quality authority it's and i  
[1:34:58](https://youtu.be/aliu6yertgo?t=5698) actually put this to one of the  
[1:34:59](https://youtu.be/aliu6yertgo?t=5699) non-muslim  
[1:35:00](https://youtu.be/aliu6yertgo?t=5700) things and they said the same thing said  
[1:35:01](https://youtu.be/aliu6yertgo?t=5701) yeah it's true it's about 600. so what  
[1:35:03](https://youtu.be/aliu6yertgo?t=5703) we're talking about here  
[1:35:04](https://youtu.be/aliu6yertgo?t=5704) why is it they're using this is the new  
[1:35:06](https://youtu.be/aliu6yertgo?t=5706) this is the new ploy of these pathetic  
[1:35:08](https://youtu.be/aliu6yertgo?t=5708) people  
[1:35:08](https://youtu.be/aliu6yertgo?t=5708) that are using 600 words which are found  
[1:35:12](https://youtu.be/aliu6yertgo?t=5712) across 10 karat as evidence the quran  
[1:35:15](https://youtu.be/aliu6yertgo?t=5715) has not been preserved  
[1:35:16](https://youtu.be/aliu6yertgo?t=5716) why is that evidence that the quran has  
[1:35:17](https://youtu.be/aliu6yertgo?t=5717) not been preserved it has no evidence at  
[1:35:19](https://youtu.be/aliu6yertgo?t=5719) all  
[1:35:20](https://youtu.be/aliu6yertgo?t=5720) because we have a hadith of the prophet  
[1:35:22](https://youtu.be/aliu6yertgo?t=5722) saying  
[1:35:24](https://youtu.be/aliu6yertgo?t=5724) it came down like that and i came now  
[1:35:25](https://youtu.be/aliu6yertgo?t=5725) malik and malik is a very prominent  
[1:35:27](https://youtu.be/aliu6yertgo?t=5727) example  
[1:35:28](https://youtu.be/aliu6yertgo?t=5728) why can't we not think why is it so  
[1:35:29](https://youtu.be/aliu6yertgo?t=5729) difficult to believe  
[1:35:31](https://youtu.be/aliu6yertgo?t=5731) that there are 600 of these examples of  
[1:35:33](https://youtu.be/aliu6yertgo?t=5733) american medic in the quran  
[1:35:35](https://youtu.be/aliu6yertgo?t=5735) and it wasn't haphazard it's not it's  
[1:35:38](https://youtu.be/aliu6yertgo?t=5738) not it's not it's not difficult to  
[1:35:39](https://youtu.be/aliu6yertgo?t=5739) believe that at all  
[1:35:40](https://youtu.be/aliu6yertgo?t=5740) sorry i don't find it difficult at all  
[1:35:43](https://youtu.be/aliu6yertgo?t=5743) and if you do find it difficult i think  
[1:35:44](https://youtu.be/aliu6yertgo?t=5744) that's the problem is with you not  
[1:35:46](https://youtu.be/aliu6yertgo?t=5746) with the quran or with the quran with  
[1:35:48](https://youtu.be/aliu6yertgo?t=5748) any of those things so  
[1:35:50](https://youtu.be/aliu6yertgo?t=5750) they say it's unreasonable that all the  
[1:35:52](https://youtu.be/aliu6yertgo?t=5752) usual and all the tajweed rules that the  
[1:35:54](https://youtu.be/aliu6yertgo?t=5754) prophet said  
[1:35:54](https://youtu.be/aliu6yertgo?t=5754) in all these different ways we say  
[1:35:55](https://youtu.be/aliu6yertgo?t=5755) you're right it is unreasonable but he  
[1:35:57](https://youtu.be/aliu6yertgo?t=5757) didn't have to do that  
[1:35:58](https://youtu.be/aliu6yertgo?t=5758) he just had to do it one time in one  
[1:35:59](https://youtu.be/aliu6yertgo?t=5759) page and once  
[1:36:02](https://youtu.be/aliu6yertgo?t=5762) more alhamdulillah and then there's  
[1:36:04](https://youtu.be/aliu6yertgo?t=5764) pierce that's done on it and the rest  
[1:36:06](https://youtu.be/aliu6yertgo?t=5766) with the  
[1:36:06](https://youtu.be/aliu6yertgo?t=5766) with the fool that the ferocious is very  
[1:36:07](https://youtu.be/aliu6yertgo?t=5767) small anyways the differences are six  
[1:36:09](https://youtu.be/aliu6yertgo?t=5769) hundred number  
[1:36:10](https://youtu.be/aliu6yertgo?t=5770) of seventy seven thousand times that are  
[1:36:11](https://youtu.be/aliu6yertgo?t=5771) divided by each other and then times up  
[1:36:13](https://youtu.be/aliu6yertgo?t=5773) by a hundred you'll see that it's less  
[1:36:16](https://youtu.be/aliu6yertgo?t=5776) all right we're coming too close to  
[1:36:17](https://youtu.be/aliu6yertgo?t=5777) twelve o'clock so i think we need to

[1:36:57](https://youtu.be/aliu6yertgo?t=5817) hello hello  
[1:37:03](https://youtu.be/aliu6yertgo?t=5823) with youtube and that's why that's why  
[1:37:06](https://youtu.be/aliu6yertgo?t=5826) there's an echo  
[1:37:07](https://youtu.be/aliu6yertgo?t=5827) can you hear me yeah  
[1:37:10](https://youtu.be/aliu6yertgo?t=5830) what's the problem right oh sorry uh  
[1:37:13](https://youtu.be/aliu6yertgo?t=5833) i'll turn that fan off how can i turn  
[1:37:15](https://youtu.be/aliu6yertgo?t=5835) the echo off  
[1:37:17](https://youtu.be/aliu6yertgo?t=5837) this off now all right so first i want  
[1:37:20](https://youtu.be/aliu6yertgo?t=5840) to say uh  
[1:37:21](https://youtu.be/aliu6yertgo?t=5841) like um muhammad hijab i've read your  
[1:37:23](https://youtu.be/aliu6yertgo?t=5843) book it's blowing my mind  
[1:37:26](https://youtu.be/aliu6yertgo?t=5846) um it's the one about metaphysics like  
[1:37:31](https://youtu.be/aliu6yertgo?t=5851) yeah i read it and it's blowing my mind  
[1:37:34](https://youtu.be/aliu6yertgo?t=5854) it's made me think about things  
[1:37:36](https://youtu.be/aliu6yertgo?t=5856) then we look at things a lot differently  
[1:37:38](https://youtu.be/aliu6yertgo?t=5858) um i talked about maths  
[1:37:40](https://youtu.be/aliu6yertgo?t=5860) and it just it's really it brings the  
[1:37:43](https://youtu.be/aliu6yertgo?t=5863) whole argument of like um  
[1:37:45](https://youtu.be/aliu6yertgo?t=5865) this it makes the whole atheist argument  
[1:37:48](https://youtu.be/aliu6yertgo?t=5868) very very hollow  
[1:37:49](https://youtu.be/aliu6yertgo?t=5869) uh wouldn't you bring metaphysics in  
[1:37:51](https://youtu.be/aliu6yertgo?t=5871) because you can't really deny  
[1:37:52](https://youtu.be/aliu6yertgo?t=5872) metaphysics  
[1:37:54](https://youtu.be/aliu6yertgo?t=5874) um that's not the question and i'll try  
[1:37:56](https://youtu.be/aliu6yertgo?t=5876) to be quick because i think there's all  
[1:37:58](https://youtu.be/aliu6yertgo?t=5878) people waiting and  
[1:37:58](https://youtu.be/aliu6yertgo?t=5878) yeah and i've just got one question i  
[1:38:01](https://youtu.be/aliu6yertgo?t=5881) would say  
[1:38:02](https://youtu.be/aliu6yertgo?t=5882) a muslim this question i have it doesn't  
[1:38:04](https://youtu.be/aliu6yertgo?t=5884) really discount islam as a whole it  
[1:38:06](https://youtu.be/aliu6yertgo?t=5886) doesn't it doesn't discard monetization  
[1:38:07](https://youtu.be/aliu6yertgo?t=5887) but it's really weird  
[1:38:09](https://youtu.be/aliu6yertgo?t=5889) it's made me it's made me like feel  
[1:38:12](https://youtu.be/aliu6yertgo?t=5892) weird about it  
[1:38:13](https://youtu.be/aliu6yertgo?t=5893) um so this is i was really reading  
[1:38:15](https://youtu.be/aliu6yertgo?t=5895) hadith randomly  
[1:38:16](https://youtu.be/aliu6yertgo?t=5896) uh i was in surah bakari and i come  
[1:38:19](https://youtu.be/aliu6yertgo?t=5899) across a hadith  
[1:38:20](https://youtu.be/aliu6yertgo?t=5900) about aisha and she said something like  
[1:38:23](https://youtu.be/aliu6yertgo?t=5903) to prophet muhammad  
[1:38:25](https://youtu.be/aliu6yertgo?t=5905) is like why do trees are dogs or camels  
[1:38:30](https://youtu.be/aliu6yertgo?t=5910) it pertains towards it reading mars and  
[1:38:32](https://youtu.be/aliu6yertgo?t=5912) how  
[1:38:33](https://youtu.be/aliu6yertgo?t=5913) how he says basically if a woman touches  
[1:38:35](https://youtu.be/aliu6yertgo?t=5915) your dog touches you or camel touches  
[1:38:36](https://youtu.be/aliu6yertgo?t=5916) you  
[1:38:37](https://youtu.be/aliu6yertgo?t=5917) invalidates it in my head  
[1:38:40](https://youtu.be/aliu6yertgo?t=5920) how rationalized this it's like maybe  
[1:38:42](https://youtu.be/aliu6yertgo?t=5922) she says it's immature because  
[1:38:44](https://youtu.be/aliu6yertgo?t=5924) how can she say this about the prophet  
[1:38:46](https://youtu.be/aliu6yertgo?t=5926) muhammed's versus dogs  
[1:38:48](https://youtu.be/aliu6yertgo?t=5928) and because i've seen that she's but  
[1:38:50](https://youtu.be/aliu6yertgo?t=5930) temperamental as well  
[1:38:52](https://youtu.be/aliu6yertgo?t=5932) is this a genuine hadith why would she  
[1:38:55](https://youtu.be/aliu6yertgo?t=5935) why would she accuse the prophet  
[1:39:15](https://youtu.be/aliu6yertgo?t=5955) you know if if one of three entities  
[1:39:18](https://youtu.be/aliu6yertgo?t=5958) comes in front of you  
[1:39:20](https://youtu.be/aliu6yertgo?t=5960) uh what can we get the actual hadith i  
[1:39:22](https://youtu.be/aliu6yertgo?t=5962) don't wanna i don't know  
[1:39:23](https://youtu.be/aliu6yertgo?t=5963) quote it so with the  
[1:39:38](https://youtu.be/aliu6yertgo?t=5978) in terms of this hadith how they have  
[1:39:42](https://youtu.be/aliu6yertgo?t=5982) they interpreted it  
[1:39:43](https://youtu.be/aliu6yertgo?t=5983) so the hamburgers know that about it so  
[1:39:45](https://youtu.be/aliu6yertgo?t=5985) before you go to interpretation yeah  
[1:39:47](https://youtu.be/aliu6yertgo?t=5987) just give it all right so  
[1:39:48](https://youtu.be/aliu6yertgo?t=5988) sorry i apologize now in terms of hadees  
[1:39:51](https://youtu.be/aliu6yertgo?t=5991) do you want to get the have you thought  
[1:39:52](https://youtu.be/aliu6yertgo?t=5992) what does it say  
[1:40:06](https://youtu.be/aliu6yertgo?t=6006) prayer of the person is invalidated the  
[1:40:10](https://youtu.be/aliu6yertgo?t=6010) three things go in front of it  
[1:40:11](https://youtu.be/aliu6yertgo?t=6011) uh or not i mean this is the question is  
[1:40:13](https://youtu.be/aliu6yertgo?t=6013) it invalidated right  
[1:40:16](https://youtu.be/aliu6yertgo?t=6016) so it cuts the prayer of the muslim or  
[1:40:19](https://youtu.be/aliu6yertgo?t=6019) three things come in front of it  
[1:40:20](https://youtu.be/aliu6yertgo?t=6020) the  
[1:40:25](https://youtu.be/aliu6yertgo?t=6025) which is a woman and and the donkey and  
[1:40:27](https://youtu.be/aliu6yertgo?t=6027) the black dog  
[1:40:28](https://youtu.be/aliu6yertgo?t=6028) now they say well that actually came  
[1:40:30](https://youtu.be/aliu6yertgo?t=6030) along  
[1:40:31](https://youtu.be/aliu6yertgo?t=6031) like you know what you put me in the  
[1:40:33](https://youtu.be/aliu6yertgo?t=6033) same characters um which obviously  
[1:40:36](https://youtu.be/aliu6yertgo?t=6036) uh is not the case in the sense that  
[1:40:38](https://youtu.be/aliu6yertgo?t=6038) well in terms of value right we know  
[1:40:39](https://youtu.be/aliu6yertgo?t=6039) that  
[1:40:40](https://youtu.be/aliu6yertgo?t=6040) men and women are actually the same in  
[1:40:42](https://youtu.be/aliu6yertgo?t=6042) terms of value in islam  
[1:40:44](https://youtu.be/aliu6yertgo?t=6044) however how did this be how was this  
[1:40:47](https://youtu.be/aliu6yertgo?t=6047) hadith interpreted does it mean yakita  
[1:40:49](https://youtu.be/aliu6yertgo?t=6049) salat  
[1:40:50](https://youtu.be/aliu6yertgo?t=6050) meaning that their prayer is invalidated  
[1:40:52](https://youtu.be/aliu6yertgo?t=6052) there are two opinions in islam one  
[1:40:53](https://youtu.be/aliu6yertgo?t=6053) opinion says yes because that's the  
[1:40:55](https://youtu.be/aliu6yertgo?t=6055) vahrehvah  
[1:40:56](https://youtu.be/aliu6yertgo?t=6056) and the other opinion says no it's not  
[1:40:58](https://youtu.be/aliu6yertgo?t=6058) invalidated because  
[1:41:01](https://youtu.be/aliu6yertgo?t=6061) does not mean invalidation that's the  
[1:41:02](https://youtu.be/aliu6yertgo?t=6062) opinion of the hamburly school now why  
[1:41:04](https://youtu.be/aliu6yertgo?t=6064) these three things why is three entities  
[1:41:06](https://youtu.be/aliu6yertgo?t=6066) in particular  
[1:41:07](https://youtu.be/aliu6yertgo?t=6067) is it because that uh all of them are  
[1:41:09](https://youtu.be/aliu6yertgo?t=6069) the same in terms of uh  
[1:41:11](https://youtu.be/aliu6yertgo?t=6071) worth absolutely not it just is the  
[1:41:13](https://youtu.be/aliu6yertgo?t=6073) three most distracting things you can  
[1:41:15](https://youtu.be/aliu6yertgo?t=6075) imagine  
[1:41:15](https://youtu.be/aliu6yertgo?t=6075) if you want to bring a heckman on this  
[1:41:17](https://youtu.be/aliu6yertgo?t=6077) if you are praying and some  
[1:41:19](https://youtu.be/aliu6yertgo?t=6079) woman comes right in front of you okay a  
[1:41:22](https://youtu.be/aliu6yertgo?t=6082) physiological impulse from a man would  
[1:41:23](https://youtu.be/aliu6yertgo?t=6083) be to be distracted by that and  
[1:41:25](https://youtu.be/aliu6yertgo?t=6085) the distraction might be as such that it  
[1:41:27](https://youtu.be/aliu6yertgo?t=6087) could actually uh  
[1:41:29](https://youtu.be/aliu6yertgo?t=6089) kind of bring you out of what you  
[1:41:30](https://youtu.be/aliu6yertgo?t=6090) started doing in the first place  
[1:41:32](https://youtu.be/aliu6yertgo?t=6092) now if someone will say well that's the  
[1:41:34](https://youtu.be/aliu6yertgo?t=6094) case why isn't it the case that for a  
[1:41:35](https://youtu.be/aliu6yertgo?t=6095) woman  
[1:41:36](https://youtu.be/aliu6yertgo?t=6096) that the man uh would break the salah  
[1:41:40](https://youtu.be/aliu6yertgo?t=6100) we say that the fact first of all the  
[1:41:42](https://youtu.be/aliu6yertgo?t=6102) fact that it breaks the salah in the in  
[1:41:44](https://youtu.be/aliu6yertgo?t=6104) the sense that it invalidates it is no  
[1:41:46](https://youtu.be/aliu6yertgo?t=6106) consensus among the muslims as we've  
[1:41:48](https://youtu.be/aliu6yertgo?t=6108) discussed  
[1:41:49](https://youtu.be/aliu6yertgo?t=6109) in the method it would not break the  
[1:41:51](https://youtu.be/aliu6yertgo?t=6111) salah the second thing is  
[1:41:54](https://youtu.be/aliu6yertgo?t=6114) there is an assumption in islam and i  
[1:41:55](https://youtu.be/aliu6yertgo?t=6115) think there's a very clear assumption  
[1:41:57](https://youtu.be/aliu6yertgo?t=6117) that there are different physiological  
[1:41:59](https://youtu.be/aliu6yertgo?t=6119) responses  
[1:42:00](https://youtu.be/aliu6yertgo?t=6120) for men and women in different  
[1:42:03](https://youtu.be/aliu6yertgo?t=6123) situations whether it's a murder  
[1:42:05](https://youtu.be/aliu6yertgo?t=6125) situation  
[1:42:06](https://youtu.be/aliu6yertgo?t=6126) whether it's uh even writing things down  
[1:42:08](https://youtu.be/aliu6yertgo?t=6128) even to anything  
[1:42:10](https://youtu.be/aliu6yertgo?t=6130) where requires witness testimony there's  
[1:42:12](https://youtu.be/aliu6yertgo?t=6132) lots of physiological impulses which are  
[1:42:13](https://youtu.be/aliu6yertgo?t=6133) different to women and men  
[1:42:15](https://youtu.be/aliu6yertgo?t=6135) now we have to be comfortable with the  
[1:42:16](https://youtu.be/aliu6yertgo?t=6136) fact that islam  
[1:42:18](https://youtu.be/aliu6yertgo?t=6138) says that equality in value between men  
[1:42:22](https://youtu.be/aliu6yertgo?t=6142) and women does not mean identicality in  
[1:42:24](https://youtu.be/aliu6yertgo?t=6144) roles  
[1:42:24](https://youtu.be/aliu6yertgo?t=6144) that's just the the assumption of the  
[1:42:26](https://youtu.be/aliu6yertgo?t=6146) second word feminism we can't run with  
[1:42:27](https://youtu.be/aliu6yertgo?t=6147) that  
[1:42:28](https://youtu.be/aliu6yertgo?t=6148) now and she said shabbat night  
[1:42:32](https://youtu.be/aliu6yertgo?t=6152) knowing full well right it was kind of  
[1:42:34](https://youtu.be/aliu6yertgo?t=6154) like a facetious statement  
[1:42:35](https://youtu.be/aliu6yertgo?t=6155) knowing full well that it's not tessuya  
[1:42:37](https://youtu.be/aliu6yertgo?t=6157) in the sense of value or  
[1:42:39](https://youtu.be/aliu6yertgo?t=6159) leveling and equal  
[1:42:43](https://youtu.be/aliu6yertgo?t=6163) she's saying that what like you know  
[1:42:44](https://youtu.be/aliu6yertgo?t=6164) you've mentioned all these three things  
[1:42:45](https://youtu.be/aliu6yertgo?t=6165) in one go  
[1:42:46](https://youtu.be/aliu6yertgo?t=6166) meaning that we're put in the same  
[1:42:48](https://youtu.be/aliu6yertgo?t=6168) category as them as the  
[1:42:50](https://youtu.be/aliu6yertgo?t=6170) donkey and the black dog these are  
[1:42:52](https://youtu.be/aliu6yertgo?t=6172) things which distract people in the  
[1:42:54](https://youtu.be/aliu6yertgo?t=6174) prayer a woman  
[1:42:55](https://youtu.be/aliu6yertgo?t=6175) i would for me personally quite frankly  
[1:42:56](https://youtu.be/aliu6yertgo?t=6176) for me a woman would distract me more  
[1:42:58](https://youtu.be/aliu6yertgo?t=6178) than a black dog  
[1:42:59](https://youtu.be/aliu6yertgo?t=6179) you know or um the donkey  
[1:43:02](https://youtu.be/aliu6yertgo?t=6182) you see because if a donkey came in  
[1:43:04](https://youtu.be/aliu6yertgo?t=6184) front of me with black talking from me  
[1:43:06](https://youtu.be/aliu6yertgo?t=6186) yeah the black dog is associated with  
[1:43:07](https://youtu.be/aliu6yertgo?t=6187) gin and stuff like you don't want to be  
[1:43:08](https://youtu.be/aliu6yertgo?t=6188) there  
[1:43:09](https://youtu.be/aliu6yertgo?t=6189) but moreover that's first part of the  
[1:43:10](https://youtu.be/aliu6yertgo?t=6190) second part of the answer is even a man  
[1:43:12](https://youtu.be/aliu6yertgo?t=6192) can  
[1:43:13](https://youtu.be/aliu6yertgo?t=6193) you know this is what there is so we  
[1:43:15](https://youtu.be/aliu6yertgo?t=6195) said about a woman  
[1:43:16](https://youtu.be/aliu6yertgo?t=6196) but even a man can have as is like that  
[1:43:18](https://youtu.be/aliu6yertgo?t=6198) as well because  
[1:43:19](https://youtu.be/aliu6yertgo?t=6199) if you put a sutra if you put a sutra  
[1:43:22](https://youtu.be/aliu6yertgo?t=6202) which is like a  
[1:43:23](https://youtu.be/aliu6yertgo?t=6203) spear-like object okay you put that in  
[1:43:25](https://youtu.be/aliu6yertgo?t=6205) front of the person and a man goes in  
[1:43:26](https://youtu.be/aliu6yertgo?t=6206) front of it it's actually hadith says  
[1:43:28](https://youtu.be/aliu6yertgo?t=6208) you can push the man  
[1:43:29](https://youtu.be/aliu6yertgo?t=6209) there's no such hadith about that for a  
[1:43:31](https://youtu.be/aliu6yertgo?t=6211) woman because the man is coming in front  
[1:43:33](https://youtu.be/aliu6yertgo?t=6213) of you can push him push him away  
[1:43:35](https://youtu.be/aliu6yertgo?t=6215) because he's like the devil it's like  
[1:43:36](https://youtu.be/aliu6yertgo?t=6216) why would he be interrupting your prayer  
[1:43:38](https://youtu.be/aliu6yertgo?t=6218) so it's not specific to women about  
[1:43:41](https://youtu.be/aliu6yertgo?t=6221) coming in front of them and they invited  
[1:43:42](https://youtu.be/aliu6yertgo?t=6222) this is that  
[1:43:43](https://youtu.be/aliu6yertgo?t=6223) coming in front of them is different to  
[1:43:44](https://youtu.be/aliu6yertgo?t=6224) coming between them and the sutra  
[1:43:46](https://youtu.be/aliu6yertgo?t=6226) where the man comes in between the sutra  
[1:43:48](https://youtu.be/aliu6yertgo?t=6228) you can actually push them away now i'm  
[1:43:50](https://youtu.be/aliu6yertgo?t=6230) saying that  
[1:43:51](https://youtu.be/aliu6yertgo?t=6231) so it's not a matter of it's amount of  
[1:43:52](https://youtu.be/aliu6yertgo?t=6232) distraction a woman poses a huge  
[1:43:55](https://youtu.be/aliu6yertgo?t=6235) distraction from a man  
[1:43:56](https://youtu.be/aliu6yertgo?t=6236) you know these kind of things man to be  
[1:43:57](https://youtu.be/aliu6yertgo?t=6237) honest you know they do social  
[1:43:59](https://youtu.be/aliu6yertgo?t=6239) experiments i was watching one minute i  
[1:44:00](https://youtu.be/aliu6yertgo?t=6240) was 16 years old  
[1:44:02](https://youtu.be/aliu6yertgo?t=6242) you know and there was a woman in the  
[1:44:03](https://youtu.be/aliu6yertgo?t=6243) street and stuff and they and they  
[1:44:04](https://youtu.be/aliu6yertgo?t=6244) tracked the eyes of the guy like how he  
[1:44:06](https://youtu.be/aliu6yertgo?t=6246) looks oh yeah yeah  
[1:44:07](https://youtu.be/aliu6yertgo?t=6247) well these things are there bro like  
[1:44:08](https://youtu.be/aliu6yertgo?t=6248) it's there's even cognitive  
[1:44:10](https://youtu.be/aliu6yertgo?t=6250) where they look and yeah where they look  
[1:44:11](https://youtu.be/aliu6yertgo?t=6251) is like the distraction that women calls  
[1:44:13](https://youtu.be/aliu6yertgo?t=6253) for men  
[1:44:14](https://youtu.be/aliu6yertgo?t=6254) is completely different on on an  
[1:44:17](https://youtu.be/aliu6yertgo?t=6257) impulsive level on a physiological level  
[1:44:20](https://youtu.be/aliu6yertgo?t=6260) than the opposite and that is just the  
[1:44:21](https://youtu.be/aliu6yertgo?t=6261) reality of the situation  
[1:44:23](https://youtu.be/aliu6yertgo?t=6263) you know and so yes there are these  
[1:44:25](https://youtu.be/aliu6yertgo?t=6265) kinds of rules but as i say  
[1:44:27](https://youtu.be/aliu6yertgo?t=6267) there's not like there's no rules for  
[1:44:28](https://youtu.be/aliu6yertgo?t=6268) men in fact being uh coming in front of  
[1:44:30](https://youtu.be/aliu6yertgo?t=6270) the sutra rules and yes we don't agree  
[1:44:33](https://youtu.be/aliu6yertgo?t=6273) that there's everything that is uh for  
[1:44:34](https://youtu.be/aliu6yertgo?t=6274) men is for women  
[1:44:35](https://youtu.be/aliu6yertgo?t=6275) and furthermore the level that the

[1:48:56](https://youtu.be/aliu6yertgo?t=6536) something yeah  
[1:48:58](https://youtu.be/aliu6yertgo?t=6538) you could be careful of entering the  
[1:49:01](https://youtu.be/aliu6yertgo?t=6541) workplace  
[1:49:02](https://youtu.be/aliu6yertgo?t=6542) with the feeling that this is going to  
[1:49:04](https://youtu.be/aliu6yertgo?t=6544) be a substitute for a family  
[1:49:06](https://youtu.be/aliu6yertgo?t=6546) let me tell you something the one of the  
[1:49:07](https://youtu.be/aliu6yertgo?t=6547) biggest studies that has ever been done  
[1:49:10](https://youtu.be/aliu6yertgo?t=6550) in psychology okay  
[1:49:14](https://youtu.be/aliu6yertgo?t=6554) was a study that was done between the  
[1:49:16](https://youtu.be/aliu6yertgo?t=6556) years of 1970 and 2000 i think or 1990  
[1:49:20](https://youtu.be/aliu6yertgo?t=6560) and it was a study by someone called  
[1:49:21](https://youtu.be/aliu6yertgo?t=6561) oswalt okay  
[1:49:23](https://youtu.be/aliu6yertgo?t=6563) and you can find this online and  
[1:49:25](https://youtu.be/aliu6yertgo?t=6565) basically in the years which  
[1:49:27](https://youtu.be/aliu6yertgo?t=6567) corresponded with  
[1:49:28](https://youtu.be/aliu6yertgo?t=6568) when the feminist movement became very  
[1:49:30](https://youtu.be/aliu6yertgo?t=6570) powerful the  
[1:49:32](https://youtu.be/aliu6yertgo?t=6572) immediate after effect where women were  
[1:49:34](https://youtu.be/aliu6yertgo?t=6574) getting more money now because they were  
[1:49:36](https://youtu.be/aliu6yertgo?t=6576) working and something like that  
[1:49:37](https://youtu.be/aliu6yertgo?t=6577) it corresponded perfectly and exactly  
[1:49:40](https://youtu.be/aliu6yertgo?t=6580) with the time where they were  
[1:49:41](https://youtu.be/aliu6yertgo?t=6581) less the least happy in their life and  
[1:49:44](https://youtu.be/aliu6yertgo?t=6584) according to the study  
[1:49:46](https://youtu.be/aliu6yertgo?t=6586) their their happiness went down almost  
[1:49:49](https://youtu.be/aliu6yertgo?t=6589) in commensurate  
[1:49:51](https://youtu.be/aliu6yertgo?t=6591) uh or mirrored way to how men's  
[1:49:54](https://youtu.be/aliu6yertgo?t=6594) happiness went up  
[1:49:55](https://youtu.be/aliu6yertgo?t=6595) men were happy not committing men were  
[1:49:57](https://youtu.be/aliu6yertgo?t=6597) happy that the woman is paying more for  
[1:49:58](https://youtu.be/aliu6yertgo?t=6598) his  
[1:49:59](https://youtu.be/aliu6yertgo?t=6599) wallet is getting bigger and so on their  
[1:50:01](https://youtu.be/aliu6yertgo?t=6601) resource extraction as they call it you  
[1:50:03](https://youtu.be/aliu6yertgo?t=6603) know those people red pills and so on  
[1:50:05](https://youtu.be/aliu6yertgo?t=6605) that was not happening so what we need  
[1:50:08](https://youtu.be/aliu6yertgo?t=6608) to understand  
[1:50:09](https://youtu.be/aliu6yertgo?t=6609) is if you decide to go into the world of  
[1:50:11](https://youtu.be/aliu6yertgo?t=6611) work  
[1:50:12](https://youtu.be/aliu6yertgo?t=6612) okay and you somehow prioritize that  
[1:50:16](https://youtu.be/aliu6yertgo?t=6616) over some things which you will find  
[1:50:18](https://youtu.be/aliu6yertgo?t=6618) natural  
[1:50:19](https://youtu.be/aliu6yertgo?t=6619) let me just put it in that sense then  
[1:50:21](https://youtu.be/aliu6yertgo?t=6621) what will happen is that according to  
[1:50:23](https://youtu.be/aliu6yertgo?t=6623) can you repeat the few words that you  
[1:50:26](https://youtu.be/aliu6yertgo?t=6626) say because i'm not  
[1:50:27](https://youtu.be/aliu6yertgo?t=6627) understand  
[1:50:30](https://youtu.be/aliu6yertgo?t=6630) if you're going to work and you start  
[1:50:33](https://youtu.be/aliu6yertgo?t=6633) okay  
[1:50:34](https://youtu.be/aliu6yertgo?t=6634) then what will happen is when you reach  
[1:50:36](https://youtu.be/aliu6yertgo?t=6636) your 30s  
[1:50:38](https://youtu.be/aliu6yertgo?t=6638) yeah you're very likely to be in a state  
[1:50:41](https://youtu.be/aliu6yertgo?t=6641) of depression  
[1:50:42](https://youtu.be/aliu6yertgo?t=6642) okay if you sacrifice what could have  
[1:50:45](https://youtu.be/aliu6yertgo?t=6645) been a healthy  
[1:50:46](https://youtu.be/aliu6yertgo?t=6646) happy family life according to the data  
[1:50:48](https://youtu.be/aliu6yertgo?t=6648) that we have  
[1:50:49](https://youtu.be/aliu6yertgo?t=6649) i'm not saying this as from my opinion  
[1:50:51](https://youtu.be/aliu6yertgo?t=6651) no this is according to the deck  
[1:50:52](https://youtu.be/aliu6yertgo?t=6652) that we have i'm not against the the  
[1:50:56](https://youtu.be/aliu6yertgo?t=6656) the the family idea but yes uh  
[1:50:59](https://youtu.be/aliu6yertgo?t=6659) there's the like i don't know how can  
[1:51:02](https://youtu.be/aliu6yertgo?t=6662) i explain it let me tell you something  
[1:51:04](https://youtu.be/aliu6yertgo?t=6664) interesting maha yeah

[1:51:47](https://youtu.be/aliu6yertgo?t=6707) yeah so she's mourning for the fact that  
[1:51:48](https://youtu.be/aliu6yertgo?t=6708) she never had kids because she was  
[1:51:50](https://youtu.be/aliu6yertgo?t=6710) attacking

[1:52:53](https://youtu.be/aliu6yertgo?t=6773) and she realized that because women were  
[1:52:55](https://youtu.be/aliu6yertgo?t=6775) following her advice they were becoming  
[1:52:56](https://youtu.be/aliu6yertgo?t=6776) more sad she wrote that herself  
[1:52:58](https://youtu.be/aliu6yertgo?t=6778) she realized that because women you know  
[1:53:00](https://youtu.be/aliu6yertgo?t=6780) they were they had so much pressure on  
[1:53:02](https://youtu.be/aliu6yertgo?t=6782) them to go into

[1:57:54](https://youtu.be/aliu6yertgo?t=7074) and we'll go with our last guest which  
[1:57:56](https://youtu.be/aliu6yertgo?t=7076) is brother  
[1:57:57](https://youtu.be/aliu6yertgo?t=7077) daniel salakum was a big  
[1:58:00](https://youtu.be/aliu6yertgo?t=7080) big fan uh hope you're doing well uh  
[1:58:03](https://youtu.be/aliu6yertgo?t=7083) i have a question i have a question in  
[1:58:06](https://youtu.be/aliu6yertgo?t=7086) regards to the attributes of allah and  
[1:58:08](https://youtu.be/aliu6yertgo?t=7088) i was asked it a while back by i think a  
[1:58:11](https://youtu.be/aliu6yertgo?t=7091) christian  
[1:58:12](https://youtu.be/aliu6yertgo?t=7092) and it's that uh can it's like to do  
[1:58:15](https://youtu.be/aliu6yertgo?t=7095) with can the attributes of allah be  
[1:58:16](https://youtu.be/aliu6yertgo?t=7096) limited to the  
[1:58:17](https://youtu.be/aliu6yertgo?t=7097) presence of the creation by necessity  
[1:58:20](https://youtu.be/aliu6yertgo?t=7100) and the example he gave was  
[1:58:21](https://youtu.be/aliu6yertgo?t=7101) prior to creation if allah was ever  
[1:58:23](https://youtu.be/aliu6yertgo?t=7103) allah if allah was ever alone  
[1:58:26](https://youtu.be/aliu6yertgo?t=7106) why would there be a need for the mercy  
[1:58:29](https://youtu.be/aliu6yertgo?t=7109) like the infinite mercy or the other  
[1:58:30](https://youtu.be/aliu6yertgo?t=7110) forgivingness that  
[1:58:31](https://youtu.be/aliu6yertgo?t=7111) of allah and i i guess like in between  
[1:58:34](https://youtu.be/aliu6yertgo?t=7114) especially the question is the  
[1:58:35](https://youtu.be/aliu6yertgo?t=7115) is the need for the attribute a  
[1:58:37](https://youtu.be/aliu6yertgo?t=7117) determiner and is the attribute  
[1:58:39](https://youtu.be/aliu6yertgo?t=7119) ever present in allah so the answer is  
[1:58:42](https://youtu.be/aliu6yertgo?t=7122) no the need for the abstract the  
[1:58:43](https://youtu.be/aliu6yertgo?t=7123) so-called need for the attribute is  
[1:58:45](https://youtu.be/aliu6yertgo?t=7125) actually the wrong wording because  
[1:58:46](https://youtu.be/aliu6yertgo?t=7126) allah does not need anything right but  
[1:58:48](https://youtu.be/aliu6yertgo?t=7128) it's not that allah he addresses that  
[1:58:50](https://youtu.be/aliu6yertgo?t=7130) he's facing what's  
[1:58:51](https://youtu.be/aliu6yertgo?t=7131) out there that allah is and everything  
[1:58:54](https://youtu.be/aliu6yertgo?t=7134) will follow  
[1:58:55](https://youtu.be/aliu6yertgo?t=7135) right right so there is a very famous  
[1:58:57](https://youtu.be/aliu6yertgo?t=7137) but he's kind of allah  
[1:59:00](https://youtu.be/aliu6yertgo?t=7140) you know what kind of there's two  
[1:59:02](https://youtu.be/aliu6yertgo?t=7142) there's two readings  
[1:59:03](https://youtu.be/aliu6yertgo?t=7143) one is like allah existed and there was  
[1:59:06](https://youtu.be/aliu6yertgo?t=7146) nothing with him  
[1:59:07](https://youtu.be/aliu6yertgo?t=7147) and there's one additional uh part of  
[1:59:10](https://youtu.be/aliu6yertgo?t=7150) the hadith who says  
[1:59:11](https://youtu.be/aliu6yertgo?t=7151) and that his arasho is thrown on the  
[1:59:13](https://youtu.be/aliu6yertgo?t=7153) water which would indicate that there  
[1:59:14](https://youtu.be/aliu6yertgo?t=7154) was something there right  
[1:59:16](https://youtu.be/aliu6yertgo?t=7156) so that's why the scholars have  
[1:59:17](https://youtu.be/aliu6yertgo?t=7157) different words allah ever alone in that  
[1:59:18](https://youtu.be/aliu6yertgo?t=7158) sense  
[1:59:19](https://youtu.be/aliu6yertgo?t=7159) but anyway the point is it's irrelevant  
[1:59:22](https://youtu.be/aliu6yertgo?t=7162) because if you get someone who is all  
[1:59:24](https://youtu.be/aliu6yertgo?t=7164) loving a very loving person he loves his  
[1:59:25](https://youtu.be/aliu6yertgo?t=7165) children so you put him in a desert  
[1:59:26](https://youtu.be/aliu6yertgo?t=7166) island  
[1:59:28](https://youtu.be/aliu6yertgo?t=7168) the end of the day allah does not need  
[1:59:31](https://youtu.be/aliu6yertgo?t=7171) to to  
[1:59:31](https://youtu.be/aliu6yertgo?t=7171) exercise the action in order to have it  
[1:59:33](https://youtu.be/aliu6yertgo?t=7173) and that is a logical quantity to think  
[1:59:36](https://youtu.be/aliu6yertgo?t=7176) that you need to be exercising something  
[1:59:38](https://youtu.be/aliu6yertgo?t=7178) in order to have it  
[1:59:40](https://youtu.be/aliu6yertgo?t=7180) that is full of good and there's nothing  
[1:59:42](https://youtu.be/aliu6yertgo?t=7182) to presuppose that and the christians  
[1:59:44](https://youtu.be/aliu6yertgo?t=7184) will come and say well  
[1:59:45](https://youtu.be/aliu6yertgo?t=7185) that's why um the trinity makes sense  
[1:59:47](https://youtu.be/aliu6yertgo?t=7187) because love  
[1:59:48](https://youtu.be/aliu6yertgo?t=7188) needed to be a thing to be manifested to  
[1:59:52](https://youtu.be/aliu6yertgo?t=7192) someone so that the bodies of the  
[1:59:53](https://youtu.be/aliu6yertgo?t=7193) trinity are also on each other  
[1:59:55](https://youtu.be/aliu6yertgo?t=7195) so okay well do you believe that a  
[1:59:56](https://youtu.be/aliu6yertgo?t=7196) creation acts 9 or they say yes we  
[1:59:58](https://youtu.be/aliu6yertgo?t=7198) believe  
[1:59:58](https://youtu.be/aliu6yertgo?t=7198) most of them do believe in krishna  
[2:00:00](https://youtu.be/aliu6yertgo?t=7200) meaning they believe that there was a  
[2:00:01](https://youtu.be/aliu6yertgo?t=7201) point  
[2:00:02](https://youtu.be/aliu6yertgo?t=7202) where the creation was as well allah was  
[2:00:03](https://youtu.be/aliu6yertgo?t=7203) creating what about forgiveness  
[2:00:05](https://youtu.be/aliu6yertgo?t=7205) whether human beings always there that  
[2:00:07](https://youtu.be/aliu6yertgo?t=7207) needs his forgiveness no  
[2:00:08](https://youtu.be/aliu6yertgo?t=7208) so what about forgiveness there's so  
[2:00:10](https://youtu.be/aliu6yertgo?t=7210) many examples like that criticisms  
[2:00:11](https://youtu.be/aliu6yertgo?t=7211) cannot answer those  
[2:00:12](https://youtu.be/aliu6yertgo?t=7212) so they are selected in choosing which  
[2:00:14](https://youtu.be/aliu6yertgo?t=7214) attributes they think  
[2:00:16](https://youtu.be/aliu6yertgo?t=7216) need to be manifested based on the  
[2:00:18](https://youtu.be/aliu6yertgo?t=7218) attribute based on the situation  
[2:00:19](https://youtu.be/aliu6yertgo?t=7219) but then once again they're not they're  
[2:00:21](https://youtu.be/aliu6yertgo?t=7221) not applying that to all the actual  
[2:00:23](https://youtu.be/aliu6yertgo?t=7223) we're saying therefore you know i'm so  
[2:00:25](https://youtu.be/aliu6yertgo?t=7225) sure that it's not the case that allah  
[2:00:27](https://youtu.be/aliu6yertgo?t=7227) is not some evolutionary theory that  
[2:00:29](https://youtu.be/aliu6yertgo?t=7229) allah only he only has attributes to the  
[2:00:32](https://youtu.be/aliu6yertgo?t=7232) need of the  
[2:00:33](https://youtu.be/aliu6yertgo?t=7233) environment around him that's that's  
[2:00:35](https://youtu.be/aliu6yertgo?t=7235) such like an absolutely morphistic way  
[2:00:37](https://youtu.be/aliu6yertgo?t=7237) of thinking about it like this is like  
[2:00:38](https://youtu.be/aliu6yertgo?t=7238) whatever it says they made allah the  
[2:00:42](https://youtu.be/aliu6yertgo?t=7242) the the the branch and they made  
[2:00:44](https://youtu.be/aliu6yertgo?t=7244) themselves they made themselves  
[2:00:47](https://youtu.be/aliu6yertgo?t=7247) so it's like the reasoning backwards  
[2:00:48](https://youtu.be/aliu6yertgo?t=7248) from the creation and they think that  
[2:00:50](https://youtu.be/aliu6yertgo?t=7250) whatever  
[2:00:51](https://youtu.be/aliu6yertgo?t=7251) is applicable to there's nothing and  
[2:00:54](https://youtu.be/aliu6yertgo?t=7254) there's nothing  
[2:00:55](https://youtu.be/aliu6yertgo?t=7255) in in monty in logic  
[2:00:58](https://youtu.be/aliu6yertgo?t=7258) that'll make us think that yeah thank  
[2:01:01](https://youtu.be/aliu6yertgo?t=7261) you very much  
[2:01:01](https://youtu.be/aliu6yertgo?t=7261) i appreciate the answer brother  
[2:01:05](https://youtu.be/aliu6yertgo?t=7265) bless you thank you for joining us on  
[2:01:08](https://youtu.be/aliu6yertgo?t=7268) sapience institute live  
[2:01:12](https://youtu.be/aliu6yertgo?t=7272) okay so we're gonna come to an end now  
[2:01:14](https://youtu.be/aliu6yertgo?t=7274) uh anybody who  
[2:01:16](https://youtu.be/aliu6yertgo?t=7276) we didn't invite we really do apologize  
[2:01:19](https://youtu.be/aliu6yertgo?t=7279) a lot of people were trying to join and  
[2:01:20](https://youtu.be/aliu6yertgo?t=7280) obviously  
[2:01:24](https://youtu.be/aliu6yertgo?t=7284) last person okay there you go okay  
[2:01:33](https://youtu.be/aliu6yertgo?t=7293) we added you as the additional guest  
[2:01:42](https://youtu.be/aliu6yertgo?t=7302) regarding the absurdity of the infinite  
[2:01:45](https://youtu.be/aliu6yertgo?t=7305) regress  
[2:01:46](https://youtu.be/aliu6yertgo?t=7306) and i was like um like how do we know  
[2:01:48](https://youtu.be/aliu6yertgo?t=7308) that infinite regress is absurd like um  
[2:01:50](https://youtu.be/aliu6yertgo?t=7310) especially in light of things like like  
[2:01:52](https://youtu.be/aliu6yertgo?t=7312) the xenos paradoxes and like  
[2:01:54](https://youtu.be/aliu6yertgo?t=7314) um so how do we how do we justify  
[2:01:57](https://youtu.be/aliu6yertgo?t=7317) that infinite regress is something that  
[2:02:00](https://youtu.be/aliu6yertgo?t=7320) is absurd  
[2:02:06](https://youtu.be/aliu6yertgo?t=7326) are you aware of the standard way that  
[2:02:09](https://youtu.be/aliu6yertgo?t=7329) the absurdity of  
[2:02:11](https://youtu.be/aliu6yertgo?t=7331) the infinite regress is explained  
[2:02:14](https://youtu.be/aliu6yertgo?t=7334) yeah can i state it so it's basically  
[2:02:17](https://youtu.be/aliu6yertgo?t=7337) that  
[2:02:17](https://youtu.be/aliu6yertgo?t=7337) so for instance just in the case of um  
[2:02:23](https://youtu.be/aliu6yertgo?t=7343) okay um basically  
[2:02:27](https://youtu.be/aliu6yertgo?t=7347) so for instance in the case of length  
[2:02:28](https://youtu.be/aliu6yertgo?t=7348) length has to be made up of discrete  
[2:02:30](https://youtu.be/aliu6yertgo?t=7350) indivisible chunks because otherwise we  
[2:02:31](https://youtu.be/aliu6yertgo?t=7351) have infinitely many infinitesimal  
[2:02:33](https://youtu.be/aliu6yertgo?t=7353) chunks  
[2:02:34](https://youtu.be/aliu6yertgo?t=7354) and that would add up to literally  
[2:02:36](https://youtu.be/aliu6yertgo?t=7356) nothing because each chunk is zero  
[2:02:38](https://youtu.be/aliu6yertgo?t=7358) and this is in a similar way right is  
[2:02:41](https://youtu.be/aliu6yertgo?t=7361) this correct  
[2:02:43](https://youtu.be/aliu6yertgo?t=7363) we usually use the example in terms of  
[2:02:45](https://youtu.be/aliu6yertgo?t=7365) the first cause  
[2:02:46](https://youtu.be/aliu6yertgo?t=7366) and a series of causes going back  
[2:02:49](https://youtu.be/aliu6yertgo?t=7369) forever would mean that the effect today  
[2:02:52](https://youtu.be/aliu6yertgo?t=7372) was not  
[2:02:52](https://youtu.be/aliu6yertgo?t=7372) true um so in in terms of  
[2:02:56](https://youtu.be/aliu6yertgo?t=7376) a discrete length  
[2:02:59](https://youtu.be/aliu6yertgo?t=7379) which is being cut off in into infinite  
[2:03:01](https://youtu.be/aliu6yertgo?t=7381) amount of  
[2:03:02](https://youtu.be/aliu6yertgo?t=7382) uh units where i i usually don't use  
[2:03:06](https://youtu.be/aliu6yertgo?t=7386) that i just use  
[2:03:07](https://youtu.be/aliu6yertgo?t=7387) a infinite regress of causes uh and um  
[2:03:11](https://youtu.be/aliu6yertgo?t=7391) you know this is actually something  
[2:03:13](https://youtu.be/aliu6yertgo?t=7393) which even  
[2:03:14](https://youtu.be/aliu6yertgo?t=7394) in the god delusion interestingly enough  
[2:03:17](https://youtu.be/aliu6yertgo?t=7397) uh  
[2:03:18](https://youtu.be/aliu6yertgo?t=7398) you know richard dawkins talks about  
[2:03:19](https://youtu.be/aliu6yertgo?t=7399) this first cause which is  
[2:03:21](https://youtu.be/aliu6yertgo?t=7401) you know there can't be an infinite  
[2:03:22](https://youtu.be/aliu6yertgo?t=7402) regress and you know okay what is the  
[2:03:24](https://youtu.be/aliu6yertgo?t=7404) first cause going to be so whether  
[2:03:25](https://youtu.be/aliu6yertgo?t=7405) you're an atheist or a theist  
[2:03:27](https://youtu.be/aliu6yertgo?t=7407) the idea that there is a primary first  
[2:03:30](https://youtu.be/aliu6yertgo?t=7410) cause because of the absurdity of  
[2:03:33](https://youtu.be/aliu6yertgo?t=7413) infinite regress  
[2:03:35](https://youtu.be/aliu6yertgo?t=7415) being real um is something which  
[2:03:38](https://youtu.be/aliu6yertgo?t=7418) usually is not challenged so i'm not  
[2:03:40](https://youtu.be/aliu6yertgo?t=7420) sure um  
[2:03:42](https://youtu.be/aliu6yertgo?t=7422) you know so the thing is like you  
[2:03:45](https://youtu.be/aliu6yertgo?t=7425) you can't have so if you're moving like  
[2:03:48](https://youtu.be/aliu6yertgo?t=7428) from point a to point b  
[2:03:49](https://youtu.be/aliu6yertgo?t=7429) you can you can you have like infinitely  
[2:03:51](https://youtu.be/aliu6yertgo?t=7431) many points before that but the motion  
[2:03:53](https://youtu.be/aliu6yertgo?t=7433) is possible so in a similar way can't  
[2:03:54](https://youtu.be/aliu6yertgo?t=7434) that happen  
[2:03:55](https://youtu.be/aliu6yertgo?t=7435) like backwards we need to differentiate  
[2:03:58](https://youtu.be/aliu6yertgo?t=7438) between an infinite regress of causation  
[2:04:00](https://youtu.be/aliu6yertgo?t=7440) and an infinite regress in general okay  
[2:04:04](https://youtu.be/aliu6yertgo?t=7444) now my personal opinion is that the  
[2:04:07](https://youtu.be/aliu6yertgo?t=7447) infinite  
[2:04:08](https://youtu.be/aliu6yertgo?t=7448) the infinity in the past is not  
[2:04:10](https://youtu.be/aliu6yertgo?t=7450) something which is  
[2:04:11](https://youtu.be/aliu6yertgo?t=7451) uh necessarily absurd in that sense it's  
[2:04:13](https://youtu.be/aliu6yertgo?t=7453) not it's actually conceivable right  
[2:04:15](https://youtu.be/aliu6yertgo?t=7455) so for example you're talking about the  
[2:04:17](https://youtu.be/aliu6yertgo?t=7457) infinite now amount of lines between  
[2:04:19](https://youtu.be/aliu6yertgo?t=7459) this point and this point  
[2:04:21](https://youtu.be/aliu6yertgo?t=7461) that's something which is conceivable  
[2:04:22](https://youtu.be/aliu6yertgo?t=7462) there's uh you know there's infinite  
[2:04:24](https://youtu.be/aliu6yertgo?t=7464) amount of lines and that's where it's  
[2:04:25](https://youtu.be/aliu6yertgo?t=7465) material infinity right  
[2:04:27](https://youtu.be/aliu6yertgo?t=7467) and people that kind of made arguments  
[2:04:30](https://youtu.be/aliu6yertgo?t=7470) for god's existence many of them  
[2:04:32](https://youtu.be/aliu6yertgo?t=7472) were eternalists and being eternalist  
[2:04:34](https://youtu.be/aliu6yertgo?t=7474) means you believed that there was an  
[2:04:35](https://youtu.be/aliu6yertgo?t=7475) infinite amount of time that pre-existed  
[2:04:38](https://youtu.be/aliu6yertgo?t=7478) like avicenna was the nutella  
[2:04:40](https://youtu.be/aliu6yertgo?t=7480) uh my understanding also aristotle was  
[2:04:42](https://youtu.be/aliu6yertgo?t=7482) that so i have to double check his books  
[2:04:44](https://youtu.be/aliu6yertgo?t=7484) to physics and the metaphysics  
[2:04:46](https://youtu.be/aliu6yertgo?t=7486) but um i mean funny enough even tamiya  
[2:04:48](https://youtu.be/aliu6yertgo?t=7488) in a sense he believed that  
[2:04:50](https://youtu.be/aliu6yertgo?t=7490) what he called which is basically  
[2:04:54](https://youtu.be/aliu6yertgo?t=7494) like things existed one after you're  
[2:04:55](https://youtu.be/aliu6yertgo?t=7495) perpetually up until  
[2:04:57](https://youtu.be/aliu6yertgo?t=7497) no point so they all all of these  
[2:05:00](https://youtu.be/aliu6yertgo?t=7500) eternalists  
[2:05:01](https://youtu.be/aliu6yertgo?t=7501) they differentiate very clearly  
[2:05:03](https://youtu.be/aliu6yertgo?t=7503) concisely between  
[2:05:05](https://youtu.be/aliu6yertgo?t=7505) an infinite regress of say time infinite  
[2:05:08](https://youtu.be/aliu6yertgo?t=7508) regress of things whatever those things  
[2:05:09](https://youtu.be/aliu6yertgo?t=7509) may be  
[2:05:10](https://youtu.be/aliu6yertgo?t=7510) and on the other hand an infinite  
[2:05:11](https://youtu.be/aliu6yertgo?t=7511) regress of causation  
[2:05:13](https://youtu.be/aliu6yertgo?t=7513) now what is absurd is the infinite  
[2:05:16](https://youtu.be/aliu6yertgo?t=7516) rigors of causation okay  
[2:05:18](https://youtu.be/aliu6yertgo?t=7518) that's where you have viciousness they  
[2:05:20](https://youtu.be/aliu6yertgo?t=7520) refer to this as viciousness  
[2:05:21](https://youtu.be/aliu6yertgo?t=7521) okay we're not talking about an infinite  
[2:05:24](https://youtu.be/aliu6yertgo?t=7524) regress of time  
[2:05:26](https://youtu.be/aliu6yertgo?t=7526) or things that's not what we are talking  
[2:05:28](https://youtu.be/aliu6yertgo?t=7528) about  
[2:05:29](https://youtu.be/aliu6yertgo?t=7529) we can make arguments like al ghazali  
[2:05:31](https://youtu.be/aliu6yertgo?t=7531) has made like  
[2:05:32](https://youtu.be/aliu6yertgo?t=7532) famously like the hilbert experiment and  
[2:05:36](https://youtu.be/aliu6yertgo?t=7536) we can make hugger but for me i prefer  
[2:05:39](https://youtu.be/aliu6yertgo?t=7539) to  
[2:05:39](https://youtu.be/aliu6yertgo?t=7539) sidestep those arguments i don't care  
[2:05:41](https://youtu.be/aliu6yertgo?t=7541) about this argument me personally i find  
[2:05:44](https://youtu.be/aliu6yertgo?t=7544) the strongest way to deal with the  
[2:05:46](https://youtu.be/aliu6yertgo?t=7546) infinite regress of causation  
[2:05:48](https://youtu.be/aliu6yertgo?t=7548) point it's exactly the way they have  
[2:05:49](https://youtu.be/aliu6yertgo?t=7549) sent and dealt with it which is to say  
[2:05:51](https://youtu.be/aliu6yertgo?t=7551) that if you believe in that then there's  
[2:05:53](https://youtu.be/aliu6yertgo?t=7553) the absurdity of believing that causes  
[2:05:55](https://youtu.be/aliu6yertgo?t=7555) will be effects  
[2:05:56](https://youtu.be/aliu6yertgo?t=7556) and the effects will be the same causes  
[2:05:57](https://youtu.be/aliu6yertgo?t=7557) for those effects there's one level of  
[2:05:59](https://youtu.be/aliu6yertgo?t=7559) absurdity  
[2:06:00](https://youtu.be/aliu6yertgo?t=7560) and another point of absurdity and this  
[2:06:02](https://youtu.be/aliu6yertgo?t=7562) is mentioned by the way  
[2:06:04](https://youtu.be/aliu6yertgo?t=7564) herbert davidson's book probably the  
[2:06:06](https://youtu.be/aliu6yertgo?t=7566) best book on  
[2:06:07](https://youtu.be/aliu6yertgo?t=7567) ancient english language um  
[2:06:11](https://youtu.be/aliu6yertgo?t=7571) which is about jewish kalam also about  
[2:06:14](https://youtu.be/aliu6yertgo?t=7574) um arabic kell amazon on these matters  
[2:06:17](https://youtu.be/aliu6yertgo?t=7577) okay  
[2:06:18](https://youtu.be/aliu6yertgo?t=7578) uh of course you can read uh frank  
[2:06:20](https://youtu.be/aliu6yertgo?t=7580) griffin for  
[2:06:21](https://youtu.be/aliu6yertgo?t=7581) for who he doesn't he believes that any  
[2:06:24](https://youtu.be/aliu6yertgo?t=7584) kind of infinity in the material world  
[2:06:26](https://youtu.be/aliu6yertgo?t=7586) would be impossible  
[2:06:27](https://youtu.be/aliu6yertgo?t=7587) but what ivy son which i think is a  
[2:06:30](https://youtu.be/aliu6yertgo?t=7590) stroke of genius he says okay you want  
[2:06:31](https://youtu.be/aliu6yertgo?t=7591) to you want  
[2:06:32](https://youtu.be/aliu6yertgo?t=7592) an infinite regress of things you want  
[2:06:34](https://youtu.be/aliu6yertgo?t=7594) sorry an infinite regress  
[2:06:36](https://youtu.be/aliu6yertgo?t=7596) you've got an infinite regret it's not  
[2:06:37](https://youtu.be/aliu6yertgo?t=7597) probably unless let's just assume  
[2:06:40](https://youtu.be/aliu6yertgo?t=7600) that there is such a thing as an  
[2:06:41](https://youtu.be/aliu6yertgo?t=7601) infinite rules okay  
[2:06:43](https://youtu.be/aliu6yertgo?t=7603) let's assume that that infinite regress  
[2:06:45](https://youtu.be/aliu6yertgo?t=7605) exists let's assume no problem i haven't  
[2:06:47](https://youtu.be/aliu6yertgo?t=7607) got  
[2:06:47](https://youtu.be/aliu6yertgo?t=7607) let's let's do it so what now so is this  
[2:06:51](https://youtu.be/aliu6yertgo?t=7611) infinite regress is it dependent or is  
[2:06:53](https://youtu.be/aliu6yertgo?t=7613) it independent  
[2:06:55](https://youtu.be/aliu6yertgo?t=7615) now this is the question if they say  
[2:06:57](https://youtu.be/aliu6yertgo?t=7617) well it's dependent then what is it  
[2:06:59](https://youtu.be/aliu6yertgo?t=7619) dependent on it has to be dependent on  
[2:07:00](https://youtu.be/aliu6yertgo?t=7620) something which is  
[2:07:01](https://youtu.be/aliu6yertgo?t=7621) either dependable independent and then  
[2:07:03](https://youtu.be/aliu6yertgo?t=7623) the infinite regress will require  
[2:07:05](https://youtu.be/aliu6yertgo?t=7625) an infinite rubric of itself and then  
[2:07:07](https://youtu.be/aliu6yertgo?t=7627) you have another problem here  
[2:07:09](https://youtu.be/aliu6yertgo?t=7629) or you could say the infinite regress  
[2:07:10](https://youtu.be/aliu6yertgo?t=7630) itself or the set of  
[2:07:13](https://youtu.be/aliu6yertgo?t=7633) things which constitute the infinite  
[2:07:14](https://youtu.be/aliu6yertgo?t=7634) regress that that thing  
[2:07:16](https://youtu.be/aliu6yertgo?t=7636) is a necessary existence that is  
[2:07:18](https://youtu.be/aliu6yertgo?t=7638) independent well we say anything that is  
[2:07:21](https://youtu.be/aliu6yertgo?t=7641) made up of parts  
[2:07:23](https://youtu.be/aliu6yertgo?t=7643) is generated the set of  
[2:07:26](https://youtu.be/aliu6yertgo?t=7646) infinite regress is made up of us  
[2:07:27](https://youtu.be/aliu6yertgo?t=7647) therefore to say is generated  
[2:07:29](https://youtu.be/aliu6yertgo?t=7649) therefore it can't be the necessary  
[2:07:31](https://youtu.be/aliu6yertgo?t=7651) necessary existence can't be made of  
[2:07:33](https://youtu.be/aliu6yertgo?t=7653) parts  
[2:07:34](https://youtu.be/aliu6yertgo?t=7654) we're saying therefore that even if you  
[2:07:36](https://youtu.be/aliu6yertgo?t=7656) presuppose the existence  
[2:07:38](https://youtu.be/aliu6yertgo?t=7658) of an infinite regress it doesn't solve  
[2:07:40](https://youtu.be/aliu6yertgo?t=7660) the problem of dependence why  
[2:07:42](https://youtu.be/aliu6yertgo?t=7662) if you say well there existed an  
[2:07:43](https://youtu.be/aliu6yertgo?t=7663) infinite tree and i've made this point  
[2:07:46](https://youtu.be/aliu6yertgo?t=7666) with edward tabash but i want to repeat  
[2:07:47](https://youtu.be/aliu6yertgo?t=7667) it  
[2:07:48](https://youtu.be/aliu6yertgo?t=7668) in his debate if you believe in an  
[2:07:50](https://youtu.be/aliu6yertgo?t=7670) infinite tree you must  
[2:07:52](https://youtu.be/aliu6yertgo?t=7672) believe that with that infinite tree  
[2:07:54](https://youtu.be/aliu6yertgo?t=7674) comes there was there's an infinite sun  
[2:07:56](https://youtu.be/aliu6yertgo?t=7676) because a tree does not exist without  
[2:07:58](https://youtu.be/aliu6yertgo?t=7678) the sun  
[2:07:59](https://youtu.be/aliu6yertgo?t=7679) you can't have photosynthesis and  
[2:08:01](https://youtu.be/aliu6yertgo?t=7681) continuation of life  
[2:08:02](https://youtu.be/aliu6yertgo?t=7682) without the sun the tree doesn't it  
[2:08:04](https://youtu.be/aliu6yertgo?t=7684) doesn't make sense  
[2:08:06](https://youtu.be/aliu6yertgo?t=7686) outside of its eco system because this  
[2:08:08](https://youtu.be/aliu6yertgo?t=7688) tree has an ecosystem  
[2:08:10](https://youtu.be/aliu6yertgo?t=7690) the ecosystem is situated in the planet  
[2:08:12](https://youtu.be/aliu6yertgo?t=7692) the planet is situated in the  
[2:08:14](https://youtu.be/aliu6yertgo?t=7694) solar system the solar system and a very  
[2:08:16](https://youtu.be/aliu6yertgo?t=7696) special place in the source  
[2:08:18](https://youtu.be/aliu6yertgo?t=7698) and the solar system is situated in the  
[2:08:19](https://youtu.be/aliu6yertgo?t=7699) universe milky way and then that's  
[2:08:21](https://youtu.be/aliu6yertgo?t=7701) situated  
[2:08:22](https://youtu.be/aliu6yertgo?t=7702) in wherever it's situated now what i'm  
[2:08:24](https://youtu.be/aliu6yertgo?t=7704) saying is  
[2:08:25](https://youtu.be/aliu6yertgo?t=7705) if all those chains of things which are  
[2:08:27](https://youtu.be/aliu6yertgo?t=7707) situated in x  
[2:08:28](https://youtu.be/aliu6yertgo?t=7708) which depend on that situation in order  
[2:08:30](https://youtu.be/aliu6yertgo?t=7710) to be what it is  
[2:08:33](https://youtu.be/aliu6yertgo?t=7713) that is is an indication of dependence  
[2:08:36](https://youtu.be/aliu6yertgo?t=7716) if you have an  
[2:08:37](https://youtu.be/aliu6yertgo?t=7717) eternal tree which existed before time  
[2:08:39](https://youtu.be/aliu6yertgo?t=7719) which means for infinite time in the  
[2:08:41](https://youtu.be/aliu6yertgo?t=7721) past  
[2:08:41](https://youtu.be/aliu6yertgo?t=7721) you'd have to have an eternal sun if you  
[2:08:43](https://youtu.be/aliu6yertgo?t=7723) have eternal rays  
[2:08:45](https://youtu.be/aliu6yertgo?t=7725) that come from the sun you have to have  
[2:08:47](https://youtu.be/aliu6yertgo?t=7727) an eternal sun we're saying  
[2:08:48](https://youtu.be/aliu6yertgo?t=7728) the existence of an eternal tree or the  
[2:08:51](https://youtu.be/aliu6yertgo?t=7731) existence of eternal raise  
[2:08:52](https://youtu.be/aliu6yertgo?t=7732) does not do anything okay but it just  
[2:08:56](https://youtu.be/aliu6yertgo?t=7736) makes gives us more questions namely the  
[2:08:58](https://youtu.be/aliu6yertgo?t=7738) question namely the question  
[2:09:00](https://youtu.be/aliu6yertgo?t=7740) what is it dependent on  
[2:09:03](https://youtu.be/aliu6yertgo?t=7743) this is the question that i'm asking  
[2:09:05](https://youtu.be/aliu6yertgo?t=7745) what is the infinite regress dependent  
[2:09:07](https://youtu.be/aliu6yertgo?t=7747) on  
[2:09:07](https://youtu.be/aliu6yertgo?t=7747) can either be dependent on itself or  
[2:09:09](https://youtu.be/aliu6yertgo?t=7749) depend on something else  
[2:09:10](https://youtu.be/aliu6yertgo?t=7750) if you say it's dependent on itself then  
[2:09:13](https://youtu.be/aliu6yertgo?t=7753) it can't be because we've talked that  
[2:09:14](https://youtu.be/aliu6yertgo?t=7754) we've already argued argumenta mad  
[2:09:16](https://youtu.be/aliu6yertgo?t=7756) absurd  
[2:09:16](https://youtu.be/aliu6yertgo?t=7756) uh i understand that it can't be because  
[2:09:19](https://youtu.be/aliu6yertgo?t=7759) of it's made of parts  
[2:09:20](https://youtu.be/aliu6yertgo?t=7760) then it has to be dependent on something  
[2:09:22](https://youtu.be/aliu6yertgo?t=7762) else what is that thing depend  
[2:09:23](https://youtu.be/aliu6yertgo?t=7763) that thing has to be either depend or  
[2:09:25](https://youtu.be/aliu6yertgo?t=7765) independent we can't keep going to do  
[2:09:27](https://youtu.be/aliu6yertgo?t=7767) this we have to have something  
[2:09:28](https://youtu.be/aliu6yertgo?t=7768) independent if we have something  
[2:09:29](https://youtu.be/aliu6yertgo?t=7769) independent  
[2:09:30](https://youtu.be/aliu6yertgo?t=7770) then the existence of an infinite amount  
[2:09:32](https://youtu.be/aliu6yertgo?t=7772) of whatever  
[2:09:33](https://youtu.be/aliu6yertgo?t=7773) so long as it's not causation it's not a  
[2:09:35](https://youtu.be/aliu6yertgo?t=7775) problem for us so  
[2:09:37](https://youtu.be/aliu6yertgo?t=7777) it's theologically because we don't  
[2:09:38](https://youtu.be/aliu6yertgo?t=7778) believe in that theologically but in  
[2:09:40](https://youtu.be/aliu6yertgo?t=7780) intellect neurologically it's not a  
[2:09:41](https://youtu.be/aliu6yertgo?t=7781) problem for us because we will just say  
[2:09:44](https://youtu.be/aliu6yertgo?t=7784) what is it dependent on we'll say it's  
[2:09:45](https://youtu.be/aliu6yertgo?t=7785) dependent on god  
[2:09:47](https://youtu.be/aliu6yertgo?t=7787) and always depends on the necessary  
[2:09:48](https://youtu.be/aliu6yertgo?t=7788) existence so it's as simple as that  
[2:09:50](https://youtu.be/aliu6yertgo?t=7790) the infinite regret does nothing yeah  
[2:09:53](https://youtu.be/aliu6yertgo?t=7793) i've listened to your  
[2:09:54](https://youtu.be/aliu6yertgo?t=7794) your this point before as well so i'm  
[2:09:56](https://youtu.be/aliu6yertgo?t=7796) definitely aware that like contingency  
[2:09:58](https://youtu.be/aliu6yertgo?t=7798) argument it would not collapse because  
[2:09:59](https://youtu.be/aliu6yertgo?t=7799) of like this issue but  
[2:10:00](https://youtu.be/aliu6yertgo?t=7800) the only thing is like what what is the  
[2:10:02](https://youtu.be/aliu6yertgo?t=7802) difference between an infinite  
[2:10:03](https://youtu.be/aliu6yertgo?t=7803) regression of causes  
[2:10:04](https://youtu.be/aliu6yertgo?t=7804) and of things or temporally or like  
[2:10:07](https://youtu.be/aliu6yertgo?t=7807) how how do you how what is the  
[2:10:09](https://youtu.be/aliu6yertgo?t=7809) difference between these that  
[2:10:11](https://youtu.be/aliu6yertgo?t=7811) helps us understand as to why for  
[2:10:13](https://youtu.be/aliu6yertgo?t=7813) causation it will be absurd and maybe  
[2:10:15](https://youtu.be/aliu6yertgo?t=7815) whatever  
[2:10:16](https://youtu.be/aliu6yertgo?t=7816) it means because a cause understood is  
[2:10:18](https://youtu.be/aliu6yertgo?t=7818) something which brings rise to phenomena  
[2:10:22](https://youtu.be/aliu6yertgo?t=7822) okay a cause is something which brings  
[2:10:23](https://youtu.be/aliu6yertgo?t=7823) rise to phenomena  
[2:10:25](https://youtu.be/aliu6yertgo?t=7825) if something brought rise to something  
[2:10:27](https://youtu.be/aliu6yertgo?t=7827) it brought off this month  
[2:10:28](https://youtu.be/aliu6yertgo?t=7828) brought right to something else which  
[2:10:29](https://youtu.be/aliu6yertgo?t=7829) brought us something up and that keeps  
[2:10:31](https://youtu.be/aliu6yertgo?t=7831) going on  
[2:10:32](https://youtu.be/aliu6yertgo?t=7832) then you would never get to the point  
[2:10:34](https://youtu.be/aliu6yertgo?t=7834) where you are speaking from that's the  
[2:10:35](https://youtu.be/aliu6yertgo?t=7835) first thing it's  
[2:10:36](https://youtu.be/aliu6yertgo?t=7836) it's a it's a matter of bitcoin they  
[2:10:38](https://youtu.be/aliu6yertgo?t=7838) don't what the way  
[2:10:40](https://youtu.be/aliu6yertgo?t=7840) that philosophers talk about infinite  
[2:10:42](https://youtu.be/aliu6yertgo?t=7842) regress is not in terms of contradiction  
[2:10:44](https://youtu.be/aliu6yertgo?t=7844) or lack thereof  
[2:10:45](https://youtu.be/aliu6yertgo?t=7845) it's in terms of viciousness or lack  
[2:10:47](https://youtu.be/aliu6yertgo?t=7847) thereof so there is an  
[2:10:49](https://youtu.be/aliu6yertgo?t=7849) in there's a they call it a vicious  
[2:10:51](https://youtu.be/aliu6yertgo?t=7851) cycle or a vicious regress okay  
[2:10:54](https://youtu.be/aliu6yertgo?t=7854) it's vicious because it's never ending  
[2:10:55](https://youtu.be/aliu6yertgo?t=7855) it keeps going it it's like a bottomless  
[2:10:57](https://youtu.be/aliu6yertgo?t=7857) pit  
[2:10:58](https://youtu.be/aliu6yertgo?t=7858) like it's it is like a bottomless pit  
[2:11:01](https://youtu.be/aliu6yertgo?t=7861) we're saying that the bottomless pit  
[2:11:03](https://youtu.be/aliu6yertgo?t=7863) doesn't explain the existence of  
[2:11:04](https://youtu.be/aliu6yertgo?t=7864) anything above it  
[2:11:06](https://youtu.be/aliu6yertgo?t=7866) simple as that it's like we when we go  
[2:11:08](https://youtu.be/aliu6yertgo?t=7868) and i've given this  
[2:11:09](https://youtu.be/aliu6yertgo?t=7869) example when you go to the sea  
[2:11:12](https://youtu.be/aliu6yertgo?t=7872) and you see the water you know there's a  
[2:11:15](https://youtu.be/aliu6yertgo?t=7875) sea floor there  
[2:11:16](https://youtu.be/aliu6yertgo?t=7876) and you know there's a sea floor there  
[2:11:18](https://youtu.be/aliu6yertgo?t=7878) because you know  
[2:11:19](https://youtu.be/aliu6yertgo?t=7879) epistemically using inference that it  
[2:11:23](https://youtu.be/aliu6yertgo?t=7883) can't keep going  
[2:11:24](https://youtu.be/aliu6yertgo?t=7884) in in in that way because there'll be no  
[2:11:26](https://youtu.be/aliu6yertgo?t=7886) foundation  
[2:11:28](https://youtu.be/aliu6yertgo?t=7888) you don't see castles floating in thin  
[2:11:30](https://youtu.be/aliu6yertgo?t=7890) air you see them all  
[2:11:32](https://youtu.be/aliu6yertgo?t=7892) with foundations so what i'm saying to  
[2:11:33](https://youtu.be/aliu6yertgo?t=7893) you is that the viciousness of the  
[2:11:36](https://youtu.be/aliu6yertgo?t=7896) infinite regress  
[2:11:37](https://youtu.be/aliu6yertgo?t=7897) and it brings us to the conclusion that  
[2:11:39](https://youtu.be/aliu6yertgo?t=7899) existence would not  
[2:11:41](https://youtu.be/aliu6yertgo?t=7901) even exist we can't have vicious or  
[2:11:43](https://youtu.be/aliu6yertgo?t=7903) ignorant because existence itself  
[2:11:44](https://youtu.be/aliu6yertgo?t=7904) would be difficult and for that reason i  
[2:11:47](https://youtu.be/aliu6yertgo?t=7907) say  
[2:11:47](https://youtu.be/aliu6yertgo?t=7907) it's the viciousness of the cycle that's  
[2:11:50](https://youtu.be/aliu6yertgo?t=7910) the problem and it's also what is that  
[2:11:52](https://youtu.be/aliu6yertgo?t=7912) what is that infinite rigorous dependent  
[2:11:54](https://youtu.be/aliu6yertgo?t=7914) on  
[2:11:55](https://youtu.be/aliu6yertgo?t=7915) even if we save is there what is it  
[2:11:57](https://youtu.be/aliu6yertgo?t=7917) dependent on can either be dependent on  
[2:11:59](https://youtu.be/aliu6yertgo?t=7919) something else or not  
[2:12:00](https://youtu.be/aliu6yertgo?t=7920) and that's what we're saying if we're
