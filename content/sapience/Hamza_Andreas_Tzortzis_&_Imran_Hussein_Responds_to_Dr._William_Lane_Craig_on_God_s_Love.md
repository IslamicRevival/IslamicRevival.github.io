, Hamza Andreas Tzortzis and Imran Hussein discuss Dr. William Lane Craig's assertion that the biblical God is not maximally forgiving. They argue that while the biblical God is loving, he is not maximally forgiving due to human sin limiting his mercy.

**[00:00:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rPvWFCdEOLU&t=0)** , Hamza Andreas Tzortzis and Imran Hussein respond to Dr. William Lane Craig's argument that God cannot be maximally loving because he is also maximally forgiving. Tzortzis argues that Craig has not studied the Islamic intellectual spiritual tradition properly, and the first premise does not have to be discussed because if someone is maximally loving, they must be maximally forgiving.
* **[00:05:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rPvWFCdEOLU&t=300)** Hamza Andreas Tzortzis and Imran Hussein discuss Dr. William Lane Craig's assertion that the biblical God is not maximally forgiving. They argue that while the biblical God is loving, he is not maximally forgiving due to human sin limiting his mercy.
* **[00:10:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rPvWFCdEOLU&t=600)** In the Islamic tradition, God is said to love those who first love Him. However, this love is not maximal, as it does not extend to those who disobey Him. Furthermore, according to the Quran, love is not the same for all beings, as some are loved more than others.
* **[00:15:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rPvWFCdEOLU&t=900)**  Hamza Andreas Tzortzis and Imran Hussein discuss Dr. William Lane Craig's assertion that God's love is "maximally perfect, but not fully perfect." Tzortzis argues that this does not make sense, because if God loves everything, he doesn't really love anything at all. He also argues that if God wants someone to be good, he should create a motivating objective for them to strive for. Hussein argues that if the purpose of creation is to love God, then it makes sense that the way God loves creation would be imperfect.
* **[00:20:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rPvWFCdEOLU&t=1200)** Hamza Andreas Tzortzis and Imran Hussein discuss Allah's love and how it differs from human love. Tzortzis argues that Allah's love is more intense and compassionate than human love, and that only those who are in a state of love can have a relationship with Allah.
* **[00:25:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rPvWFCdEOLU&t=1500)* Discusses how God's love is not limited by human sin, and that while Christian doctrine claims that Jesus died and was sacrificed for human sin, Islam believes that God's love is even greater because it does not require a human sacrifice. The clip also discusses how the Christian tradition devalues the intrinsic value of the sacrifice when it is not based on a historical event with a textual integrity problem.
* **[00:30:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rPvWFCdEOLU&t=1800)** Hamza Andreas Tzortzis and Imran Hussein respond to Dr. William Lane Craig on the nature of God's love. They discuss how throughout history, but especially in the medieval Catholic Church, Christianity has been manifesting itself in ways that are not very loving. They also discuss how a famous Jewish poet, Abraham Ezra, wrote about the love of Allah when he was living under Islamic influence. They discuss how poetry is a mirror that shows us historical trends, and how the idea of God's love and us loving God has been present throughout history through our literature. They also discuss the nature of mercy and how Allah has a tense mercy for those who are repentant.
* **[00:35:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rPvWFCdEOLU&t=2100)** Hamza Andreas Tzortzis and Imran Hussein discuss the concept of God in Islam and Christianity, and how they differ. Tzortzis argues that the concept of God in Islam is much more compassionate and universal than in Christianity, and that both approaches are complementary.
* **[00:40:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rPvWFCdEOLU&t=2400)** Hamza Andreas Tzortzis and Imran Hussein discuss Dr. William Lane Craig's recent statements about Islam and the love of God in the Islamic tradition. They invite Dr. Craig for an official debate, and ask Muslims to take responsibility for reviving this understanding of worship in the West. They suggest that Christians would have a more loving relationship with Allah if they understood who He is.
* **[00:45:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rPvWFCdEOLU&t=2700)** Hamza Andreas Tzortzis and Imran Hussein discuss Dr. William Lane Craig's argument that God hates lying, false witnesses, and heart that devises wicked imaginations. They note that this is a common narrative among Christians who are trying to argue against Islam, and that it is important to push back against these arguments by sharing accurate information about Islam.

[0:00:28](https://youtu.be/rPvWFCdEOLU?t=28) and the reason is ro because you know  
[0:00:32](https://youtu.be/rPvWFCdEOLU?t=32) throughout history Christian  
[0:00:33](https://youtu.be/rPvWFCdEOLU?t=33) missionaries have made a a objective and  
[0:00:36](https://youtu.be/rPvWFCdEOLU?t=36) goal of their lives to misrepresent  
[0:00:38](https://youtu.be/rPvWFCdEOLU?t=38) Islam through through poor translations  
[0:00:41](https://youtu.be/rPvWFCdEOLU?t=41) of the Quran  
[0:00:41](https://youtu.be/rPvWFCdEOLU?t=41) you know misrepresenting send concepts  
[0:00:44](https://youtu.be/rPvWFCdEOLU?t=44) and ideas about the Deen and now we find  
[0:00:46](https://youtu.be/rPvWFCdEOLU?t=46) individuals even today in the 21st  
[0:00:48](https://youtu.be/rPvWFCdEOLU?t=48) century respected individuals professors  
[0:00:51](https://youtu.be/rPvWFCdEOLU?t=51) who are again misrepresenting some core  
[0:00:53](https://youtu.be/rPvWFCdEOLU?t=53) fundamentals of Islam just to paint that  
[0:00:56](https://youtu.be/rPvWFCdEOLU?t=56) negative perception now in particular  
[0:00:58](https://youtu.be/rPvWFCdEOLU?t=58) what we're going to be discussing today  
[0:01:00](https://youtu.be/rPvWFCdEOLU?t=60) is a clip by dr. William Lane Craig  
[0:01:03](https://youtu.be/rPvWFCdEOLU?t=63) which has been circulating again I you  
[0:01:05](https://youtu.be/rPvWFCdEOLU?t=65) remind actually told me was quite an old  
[0:01:07](https://youtu.be/rPvWFCdEOLU?t=67) clip that was there a few years ago but  
[0:01:09](https://youtu.be/rPvWFCdEOLU?t=69) it's been recirculating again where he  
[0:01:12](https://youtu.be/rPvWFCdEOLU?t=72) speaks about Allah and he speaks about  
[0:01:15](https://youtu.be/rPvWFCdEOLU?t=75) the love of allah mentioned in the quran  
[0:01:17](https://youtu.be/rPvWFCdEOLU?t=77) and compares it to the love of god in  
[0:01:20](https://youtu.be/rPvWFCdEOLU?t=80) christianity now we're gonna go through  
[0:01:22](https://youtu.be/rPvWFCdEOLU?t=82) the whole clip and we're gonna break it  
[0:01:24](https://youtu.be/rPvWFCdEOLU?t=84) down in a second and we're gonna get  
[0:01:25](https://youtu.be/rPvWFCdEOLU?t=85) your thoughts on it and highlight why  
[0:01:27](https://youtu.be/rPvWFCdEOLU?t=87) Craig's view is incorrect it's either  
[0:01:30](https://youtu.be/rPvWFCdEOLU?t=90) that he hasn't read the Quran or  
[0:01:31](https://youtu.be/rPvWFCdEOLU?t=91) understood it properly or it's he's it's  
[0:01:33](https://youtu.be/rPvWFCdEOLU?t=93) it's that he's deliberately  
[0:01:35](https://youtu.be/rPvWFCdEOLU?t=95) misrepresenting whichever the of the  
[0:01:36](https://youtu.be/rPvWFCdEOLU?t=96) Torah is we're not gonna make that we're  
[0:01:38](https://youtu.be/rPvWFCdEOLU?t=98) not gonna make that judgment but we're  
[0:01:39](https://youtu.be/rPvWFCdEOLU?t=99) gonna put the facts on the table for  
[0:01:41](https://youtu.be/rPvWFCdEOLU?t=101) people to see for themselves in Shaba  
[0:01:42](https://youtu.be/rPvWFCdEOLU?t=102) but before we do that hamza  
[0:01:44](https://youtu.be/rPvWFCdEOLU?t=104) why don't you give us a summary bro of  
[0:01:46](https://youtu.be/rPvWFCdEOLU?t=106) what we're going to be discussing yeah  
[0:01:49](https://youtu.be/rPvWFCdEOLU?t=109) before I do that I would like to  
[0:01:50](https://youtu.be/rPvWFCdEOLU?t=110) basically say that you know we have to  
[0:01:53](https://youtu.be/rPvWFCdEOLU?t=113) have some form of intellectual humility  
[0:01:55](https://youtu.be/rPvWFCdEOLU?t=115) in gratitude as well at the same time  
[0:01:57](https://youtu.be/rPvWFCdEOLU?t=117) because dr. woody named Craig has been  
[0:01:59](https://youtu.be/rPvWFCdEOLU?t=119) responsible for reviving powerful  
[0:02:04](https://youtu.be/rPvWFCdEOLU?t=124) Islamic philosophy core arguments for  
[0:02:06](https://youtu.be/rPvWFCdEOLU?t=126) the existence of God and I personally  
[0:02:09](https://youtu.be/rPvWFCdEOLU?t=129) have benefited a lot from his work  
[0:02:13](https://youtu.be/rPvWFCdEOLU?t=133) and he is referenced in my book the  
[0:02:16](https://youtu.be/rPvWFCdEOLU?t=136) divine reality and for that we should  
[0:02:20](https://youtu.be/rPvWFCdEOLU?t=140) show some form of intellectual humility  
[0:02:22](https://youtu.be/rPvWFCdEOLU?t=142) and also gratitude notwithstanding it's  
[0:02:28](https://youtu.be/rPvWFCdEOLU?t=148) very important to highlight very  
[0:02:31](https://youtu.be/rPvWFCdEOLU?t=151) carefully that I remember dr. William  
[0:02:35](https://youtu.be/rPvWFCdEOLU?t=155) named Craig  
[0:02:36](https://youtu.be/rPvWFCdEOLU?t=156) mentioning the concept of God in Islam  
[0:02:38](https://youtu.be/rPvWFCdEOLU?t=158) and Christianity I think 12 years ago  
[0:02:42](https://youtu.be/rPvWFCdEOLU?t=162) and it struck me and I've always wanted  
[0:02:45](https://youtu.be/rPvWFCdEOLU?t=165) to respond in some way and alhamdulillah  
[0:02:49](https://youtu.be/rPvWFCdEOLU?t=169) you gave me this opportunity and may  
[0:02:51](https://youtu.be/rPvWFCdEOLU?t=171) Allah bless you and we can do this  
[0:02:53](https://youtu.be/rPvWFCdEOLU?t=173) together and the first thing I like to  
[0:02:56](https://youtu.be/rPvWFCdEOLU?t=176) say is dr. William Lane Craig has  
[0:03:00](https://youtu.be/rPvWFCdEOLU?t=180) obviously not studied the Islamic  
[0:03:02](https://youtu.be/rPvWFCdEOLU?t=182) intellectual spiritual tradition  
[0:03:03](https://youtu.be/rPvWFCdEOLU?t=183) properly he hasn't gone into the  
[0:03:07](https://youtu.be/rPvWFCdEOLU?t=187) toughest year the exegetical works of  
[0:03:09](https://youtu.be/rPvWFCdEOLU?t=189) the verses that he is referring to he in  
[0:03:13](https://youtu.be/rPvWFCdEOLU?t=193) my view hasn't studied the moment of  
[0:03:16](https://youtu.be/rPvWFCdEOLU?t=196) classical creeds and the commentaries  
[0:03:20](https://youtu.be/rPvWFCdEOLU?t=200) associated with them concerning the  
[0:03:23](https://youtu.be/rPvWFCdEOLU?t=203) conception of the divine reality in  
[0:03:25](https://youtu.be/rPvWFCdEOLU?t=205) Islam and this is problematic because  
[0:03:31](https://youtu.be/rPvWFCdEOLU?t=211) he's been willing to be very nuanced and  
[0:03:35](https://youtu.be/rPvWFCdEOLU?t=215) philosophical when it comes to  
[0:03:37](https://youtu.be/rPvWFCdEOLU?t=217) philosophical ideas existential ideas  
[0:03:40](https://youtu.be/rPvWFCdEOLU?t=220) Theo philosophical ideas but when it  
[0:03:43](https://youtu.be/rPvWFCdEOLU?t=223) comes to the divine in the Islamic  
[0:03:44](https://youtu.be/rPvWFCdEOLU?t=224) tradition  
[0:03:46](https://youtu.be/rPvWFCdEOLU?t=226) he basically regurgitates a form of  
[0:03:52](https://youtu.be/rPvWFCdEOLU?t=232) narrative that echoes someone who's been  
[0:03:55](https://youtu.be/rPvWFCdEOLU?t=235) on Google and does some basic searches  
[0:03:57](https://youtu.be/rPvWFCdEOLU?t=237) and this has to change and hopefully by  
[0:04:01](https://youtu.be/rPvWFCdEOLU?t=241) the end of this video it would evoke  
[0:04:04](https://youtu.be/rPvWFCdEOLU?t=244) something within him to engage  
[0:04:05](https://youtu.be/rPvWFCdEOLU?t=245) positively with the Islamic intellectual  
[0:04:08](https://youtu.be/rPvWFCdEOLU?t=248) spiritual tradition and hopefully engage  
[0:04:09](https://youtu.be/rPvWFCdEOLU?t=249) with us in order for us to have a  
[0:04:11](https://youtu.be/rPvWFCdEOLU?t=251) discussion on this topic so the thing I  
[0:04:14](https://youtu.be/rPvWFCdEOLU?t=254) really want to say is this there is an  
[0:04:17](https://youtu.be/rPvWFCdEOLU?t=257) argument against dr. Craig's argument  
[0:04:20](https://youtu.be/rPvWFCdEOLU?t=260) and it's based on three premises two  
[0:04:24](https://youtu.be/rPvWFCdEOLU?t=264) premises and the conclusion number one  
[0:04:27](https://youtu.be/rPvWFCdEOLU?t=267) for God to be maximally loving he has to  
[0:04:32](https://youtu.be/rPvWFCdEOLU?t=272) be maximally forgiving number two the  
[0:04:36](https://youtu.be/rPvWFCdEOLU?t=276) biblical God is not maximally forgiving  
[0:04:40](https://youtu.be/rPvWFCdEOLU?t=280) 3 therefore the biblical God is not  
[0:04:45](https://youtu.be/rPvWFCdEOLU?t=285) maximally loving and we're gonna unpack  
[0:04:48](https://youtu.be/rPvWFCdEOLU?t=288) this I think the first premise doesn't  
[0:04:49](https://youtu.be/rPvWFCdEOLU?t=289) have to be discussed because if someone  
[0:04:51](https://youtu.be/rPvWFCdEOLU?t=291) is maxima loving they have to be  
[0:04:53](https://youtu.be/rPvWFCdEOLU?t=293) maximally forgiving repeat those three  
[0:04:55](https://youtu.be/rPvWFCdEOLU?t=295) again just so everyone's on this yes so  
[0:04:57](https://youtu.be/rPvWFCdEOLU?t=297) premise number 1 for good to be  
[0:05:00](https://youtu.be/rPvWFCdEOLU?t=300) maximally loving it Intel so he has to  
[0:05:04](https://youtu.be/rPvWFCdEOLU?t=304) be maximally forgiving and this is not a  
[0:05:07](https://youtu.be/rPvWFCdEOLU?t=307) controversial premise because  
[0:05:09](https://youtu.be/rPvWFCdEOLU?t=309) forgiveness is the language of love  
[0:05:11](https://youtu.be/rPvWFCdEOLU?t=311) number 2 and this is the controversial  
[0:05:14](https://youtu.be/rPvWFCdEOLU?t=314) premise the biblical God according to  
[0:05:18](https://youtu.be/rPvWFCdEOLU?t=318) William Lane Craig is not maximally  
[0:05:20](https://youtu.be/rPvWFCdEOLU?t=320) forgiving number 3 therefore the  
[0:05:23](https://youtu.be/rPvWFCdEOLU?t=323) biblical God is not maximally loving now  
[0:05:25](https://youtu.be/rPvWFCdEOLU?t=325) why why is the biblical God not maxima  
[0:05:28](https://youtu.be/rPvWFCdEOLU?t=328) loving so not maximally forgiving and  
[0:05:31](https://youtu.be/rPvWFCdEOLU?t=331) therefore he's not maxima loving it's  
[0:05:33](https://youtu.be/rPvWFCdEOLU?t=333) very simple number 1  
[0:05:35](https://youtu.be/rPvWFCdEOLU?t=335) God's love according to a biblical  
[0:05:37](https://youtu.be/rPvWFCdEOLU?t=337) narrative is rooted in suffering God's  
[0:05:41](https://youtu.be/rPvWFCdEOLU?t=341) love in a biblical narrative is rooted  
[0:05:44](https://youtu.be/rPvWFCdEOLU?t=344) in forgiving humanity outside of the  
[0:05:47](https://youtu.be/rPvWFCdEOLU?t=347) relation all with human being in the  
[0:05:50](https://youtu.be/rPvWFCdEOLU?t=350) divine and it's based on an event that  
[0:05:53](https://youtu.be/rPvWFCdEOLU?t=353) supposedly had to happen and not only  
[0:05:57](https://youtu.be/rPvWFCdEOLU?t=357) that is based on you accepting the event  
[0:06:00](https://youtu.be/rPvWFCdEOLU?t=360) actually happened it's not rooted in  
[0:06:02](https://youtu.be/rPvWFCdEOLU?t=362) your relation to the divine your heart  
[0:06:04](https://youtu.be/rPvWFCdEOLU?t=364) being sincere in asking forgiveness to  
[0:06:06](https://youtu.be/rPvWFCdEOLU?t=366) the divine construct construct  
[0:06:09](https://youtu.be/rPvWFCdEOLU?t=369) contrastingly the islamic conception is  
[0:06:13](https://youtu.be/rPvWFCdEOLU?t=373) based on maximum forgiveness because we  
[0:06:16](https://youtu.be/rPvWFCdEOLU?t=376) just takes a human heart to repent to  
[0:06:20](https://youtu.be/rPvWFCdEOLU?t=380) the divine and this is why in the  
[0:06:22](https://youtu.be/rPvWFCdEOLU?t=382) Christian tradition because of John 3:16  
[0:06:25](https://youtu.be/rPvWFCdEOLU?t=385) because of the sacrifice and the  
[0:06:27](https://youtu.be/rPvWFCdEOLU?t=387) atonement what the biblical narrative is  
[0:06:31](https://youtu.be/rPvWFCdEOLU?t=391) saying it's saying that human sin  
[0:06:36](https://youtu.be/rPvWFCdEOLU?t=396) límites God's mercy so from  
[0:06:40](https://youtu.be/rPvWFCdEOLU?t=400) this point of view William Lane Craig I  
[0:06:43](https://youtu.be/rPvWFCdEOLU?t=403) think he's basically being a little bit  
[0:06:45](https://youtu.be/rPvWFCdEOLU?t=405) of a surfaced here because if you really  
[0:06:49](https://youtu.be/rPvWFCdEOLU?t=409) understand the Christian doctrine then  
[0:06:51](https://youtu.be/rPvWFCdEOLU?t=411) you have to admit that God is not Max  
[0:06:53](https://youtu.be/rPvWFCdEOLU?t=413) and me forgiving if it's not if he's not  
[0:06:55](https://youtu.be/rPvWFCdEOLU?t=415) maximally forgiving then how can he be  
[0:06:57](https://youtu.be/rPvWFCdEOLU?t=417) maximally loving because to be maximally  
[0:07:01](https://youtu.be/rPvWFCdEOLU?t=421) loving and tells maximum forgiveness as  
[0:07:04](https://youtu.be/rPvWFCdEOLU?t=424) well so that's the summary of what we're  
[0:07:07](https://youtu.be/rPvWFCdEOLU?t=427) gonna be talking about Wars gonna be  
[0:07:09](https://youtu.be/rPvWFCdEOLU?t=429) talking about the fact that actually  
[0:07:10](https://youtu.be/rPvWFCdEOLU?t=430) have you not read that Allah says about  
[0:07:13](https://youtu.be/rPvWFCdEOLU?t=433) himself that he is alwa dude he is there  
[0:07:16](https://youtu.be/rPvWFCdEOLU?t=436) loving that's one of his names which  
[0:07:18](https://youtu.be/rPvWFCdEOLU?t=438) comes from the Arabic Arabic word would  
[0:07:19](https://youtu.be/rPvWFCdEOLU?t=439) which means a loving that is giving he's  
[0:07:21](https://youtu.be/rPvWFCdEOLU?t=441) excessively loving his love is so pure  
[0:07:24](https://youtu.be/rPvWFCdEOLU?t=444) and so maximal that is even greater than  
[0:07:27](https://youtu.be/rPvWFCdEOLU?t=447) any form of love you can imagine in in a  
[0:07:30](https://youtu.be/rPvWFCdEOLU?t=450) worldly sense even a mother's love  
[0:07:32](https://youtu.be/rPvWFCdEOLU?t=452) because a mother she needs to love God  
[0:07:35](https://youtu.be/rPvWFCdEOLU?t=455) doesn't need anything yet he loves he  
[0:07:37](https://youtu.be/rPvWFCdEOLU?t=457) met her how pure and maximal his love is  
[0:07:40](https://youtu.be/rPvWFCdEOLU?t=460) so have you know read that God is loving  
[0:07:43](https://youtu.be/rPvWFCdEOLU?t=463) have you not read that Allah is all  
[0:07:45](https://youtu.be/rPvWFCdEOLU?t=465) right man  
[0:07:45](https://youtu.be/rPvWFCdEOLU?t=465) and which means the merciful now  
[0:07:49](https://youtu.be/rPvWFCdEOLU?t=469) interestingly from a linguistic point of  
[0:07:51](https://youtu.be/rPvWFCdEOLU?t=471) view Iraq my indicates and very intense  
[0:07:53](https://youtu.be/rPvWFCdEOLU?t=473) loving mercy a boiling over type of  
[0:07:57](https://youtu.be/rPvWFCdEOLU?t=477) messy and immediate mercy a mercy that  
[0:07:59](https://youtu.be/rPvWFCdEOLU?t=479) so powerful that no one could stop and  
[0:08:01](https://youtu.be/rPvWFCdEOLU?t=481) Allah says that his mercy encompasses  
[0:08:03](https://youtu.be/rPvWFCdEOLU?t=483) everything the sinner the evildoer the  
[0:08:08](https://youtu.be/rPvWFCdEOLU?t=488) believer the non-believer allows intense  
[0:08:12](https://youtu.be/rPvWFCdEOLU?t=492) mercy and mercy in English language is  
[0:08:14](https://youtu.be/rPvWFCdEOLU?t=494) the synonym for love encompasses  
[0:08:16](https://youtu.be/rPvWFCdEOLU?t=496) everything so why are you  
[0:08:20](https://youtu.be/rPvWFCdEOLU?t=500) misrepresenting the Islamic tradition  
[0:08:23](https://youtu.be/rPvWFCdEOLU?t=503) because there are different levels of  
[0:08:25](https://youtu.be/rPvWFCdEOLU?t=505) love in the Islamic tradition different  
[0:08:27](https://youtu.be/rPvWFCdEOLU?t=507) levels of mercy you have Rama you have a  
[0:08:30](https://youtu.be/rPvWFCdEOLU?t=510) Rahim you have Mazda you have all of  
[0:08:33](https://youtu.be/rPvWFCdEOLU?t=513) these different levels and they have  
[0:08:35](https://youtu.be/rPvWFCdEOLU?t=515) specific understandings anyone who  
[0:08:37](https://youtu.be/rPvWFCdEOLU?t=517) studied the Islamic tradition would have  
[0:08:39](https://youtu.be/rPvWFCdEOLU?t=519) known this right so you can't say good  
[0:08:43](https://youtu.be/rPvWFCdEOLU?t=523) God is not his His mercy is not  
[0:08:46](https://youtu.be/rPvWFCdEOLU?t=526) universal his mercy is what would he say  
[0:08:51](https://youtu.be/rPvWFCdEOLU?t=531) impartial and his mercies  
[0:08:53](https://youtu.be/rPvWFCdEOLU?t=533) a conditional that's not true because  
[0:08:57](https://youtu.be/rPvWFCdEOLU?t=537) Allah says his intense mercy is  
[0:08:59](https://youtu.be/rPvWFCdEOLU?t=539) impartial because this for everybody is  
[0:09:02](https://youtu.be/rPvWFCdEOLU?t=542) universal encompasses everything and  
[0:09:04](https://youtu.be/rPvWFCdEOLU?t=544) it's also unconditional Allah is  
[0:09:06](https://youtu.be/rPvWFCdEOLU?t=546) merciful to you even if you disobey him  
[0:09:09](https://youtu.be/rPvWFCdEOLU?t=549) and as I said mercy is a cinnamon  
[0:09:11](https://youtu.be/rPvWFCdEOLU?t=551) synonym for love in the Islamic  
[0:09:13](https://youtu.be/rPvWFCdEOLU?t=553) tradition so this is the kind of summary  
[0:09:15](https://youtu.be/rPvWFCdEOLU?t=555) of the things that we want to talk about  
[0:09:16](https://youtu.be/rPvWFCdEOLU?t=556) money  
[0:09:17](https://youtu.be/rPvWFCdEOLU?t=557) he actually overlooks this you know he's  
[0:09:19](https://youtu.be/rPvWFCdEOLU?t=559) just referring to well let's just  
[0:09:21](https://youtu.be/rPvWFCdEOLU?t=561) peeking about okay he loves so-and-so he  
[0:09:23](https://youtu.be/rPvWFCdEOLU?t=563) doesn't love so-and-so the Quran and he  
[0:09:24](https://youtu.be/rPvWFCdEOLU?t=564) completely neglects the aspect of mercy  
[0:09:26](https://youtu.be/rPvWFCdEOLU?t=566) and our mercy Intel's love it's a part  
[0:09:28](https://youtu.be/rPvWFCdEOLU?t=568) of love like you said and and what we're  
[0:09:30](https://youtu.be/rPvWFCdEOLU?t=570) gonna see as we discuss this bro is that  
[0:09:32](https://youtu.be/rPvWFCdEOLU?t=572) beautiful balance between the love and  
[0:09:33](https://youtu.be/rPvWFCdEOLU?t=573) mercy of Allah which works in such a  
[0:09:35](https://youtu.be/rPvWFCdEOLU?t=575) magnificent imperfect way from the  
[0:09:38](https://youtu.be/rPvWFCdEOLU?t=578) perspective of what this life is all  
[0:09:39](https://youtu.be/rPvWFCdEOLU?t=579) about we're gonna see this to it and  
[0:09:41](https://youtu.be/rPvWFCdEOLU?t=581) it's it's and if anything we're gonna  
[0:09:42](https://youtu.be/rPvWFCdEOLU?t=582) see how the conception of love and mercy  
[0:09:44](https://youtu.be/rPvWFCdEOLU?t=584) of Allah in Islam in a and it being in  
[0:09:48](https://youtu.be/rPvWFCdEOLU?t=588) line with the objective Allah created  
[0:09:49](https://youtu.be/rPvWFCdEOLU?t=589) reality for is perfect it's a completely  
[0:09:52](https://youtu.be/rPvWFCdEOLU?t=592) coherent span la one thing of an  
[0:09:54](https://youtu.be/rPvWFCdEOLU?t=594) original isn't it very interesting that  
[0:09:56](https://youtu.be/rPvWFCdEOLU?t=596) you know is it is it maximum law to  
[0:10:00](https://youtu.be/rPvWFCdEOLU?t=600) create human beings with inherits in  
[0:10:03](https://youtu.be/rPvWFCdEOLU?t=603) whereas human beings in Islamic  
[0:10:05](https://youtu.be/rPvWFCdEOLU?t=605) tradition they're created with inherent  
[0:10:08](https://youtu.be/rPvWFCdEOLU?t=608) goodness  
[0:10:08](https://youtu.be/rPvWFCdEOLU?t=608) based on the Fatah I mean case closed  
[0:10:11](https://youtu.be/rPvWFCdEOLU?t=611) that's like a philosophical mic drop  
[0:10:13](https://youtu.be/rPvWFCdEOLU?t=613) right there yeah your conception the  
[0:10:15](https://youtu.be/rPvWFCdEOLU?t=615) divine has already put a distance  
[0:10:18](https://youtu.be/rPvWFCdEOLU?t=618) between humanity and the divine because  
[0:10:20](https://youtu.be/rPvWFCdEOLU?t=620) of sin because the wages of sin is death  
[0:10:22](https://youtu.be/rPvWFCdEOLU?t=622) right God is holy according to the the  
[0:10:24](https://youtu.be/rPvWFCdEOLU?t=624) Christian tradition that's why you need  
[0:10:26](https://youtu.be/rPvWFCdEOLU?t=626) an external type of sacrifice this is  
[0:10:28](https://youtu.be/rPvWFCdEOLU?t=628) not the Islamic tradition you don't need  
[0:10:31](https://youtu.be/rPvWFCdEOLU?t=631) that you are yo your board into goodness  
[0:10:34](https://youtu.be/rPvWFCdEOLU?t=634) not into inherent evil inherent sin so  
[0:10:38](https://youtu.be/rPvWFCdEOLU?t=638) from this point of view just on that  
[0:10:40](https://youtu.be/rPvWFCdEOLU?t=640) perspective what is more loving like God  
[0:10:44](https://youtu.be/rPvWFCdEOLU?t=644) is making it harder for everybody also  
[0:10:46](https://youtu.be/rPvWFCdEOLU?t=646) going to the biblical narratives that  
[0:10:48](https://youtu.be/rPvWFCdEOLU?t=648) know only you're gonna be created be  
[0:10:49](https://youtu.be/rPvWFCdEOLU?t=649) gonna be created distant from me  
[0:10:51](https://youtu.be/rPvWFCdEOLU?t=651) inherently you're gonna have sin which  
[0:10:54](https://youtu.be/rPvWFCdEOLU?t=654) distance which distance the human being  
[0:10:57](https://youtu.be/rPvWFCdEOLU?t=657) from the divine but Allah he creates the  
[0:10:59](https://youtu.be/rPvWFCdEOLU?t=659) human being in goodness which we call  
[0:11:02](https://youtu.be/rPvWFCdEOLU?t=662) the rather innate disposition that is  
[0:11:04](https://youtu.be/rPvWFCdEOLU?t=664) based on proto knowledge that has proton  
[0:11:06](https://youtu.be/rPvWFCdEOLU?t=666) on it with  
[0:11:07](https://youtu.be/rPvWFCdEOLU?t=667) which is good as reality is worthy of  
[0:11:08](https://youtu.be/rPvWFCdEOLU?t=668) worship and we have a basic level of  
[0:11:10](https://youtu.be/rPvWFCdEOLU?t=670) goodness  
[0:11:11](https://youtu.be/rPvWFCdEOLU?t=671) Chrissie so broad before I proceed let  
[0:11:13](https://youtu.be/rPvWFCdEOLU?t=673) me clarify some through the audience  
[0:11:14](https://youtu.be/rPvWFCdEOLU?t=674) some people have had an objection with  
[0:11:17](https://youtu.be/rPvWFCdEOLU?t=677) me titling the video Hamza sources  
[0:11:18](https://youtu.be/rPvWFCdEOLU?t=678) versus William Lane Craig now I didn't  
[0:11:21](https://youtu.be/rPvWFCdEOLU?t=681) say it was a debate obviously I wanted  
[0:11:23](https://youtu.be/rPvWFCdEOLU?t=683) to make the title a bit spicy just so we  
[0:11:25](https://youtu.be/rPvWFCdEOLU?t=685) can get the interest and inshallah this  
[0:11:26](https://youtu.be/rPvWFCdEOLU?t=686) will lead to a proper discussion a  
[0:11:29](https://youtu.be/rPvWFCdEOLU?t=689) face-to-face discussion between maybe  
[0:11:31](https://youtu.be/rPvWFCdEOLU?t=691) Hamza and Willie in dr. William Lane  
[0:11:33](https://youtu.be/rPvWFCdEOLU?t=693) Craig after this goes live in Sharla so  
[0:11:36](https://youtu.be/rPvWFCdEOLU?t=696) yeah I try to clarify that I never said  
[0:11:38](https://youtu.be/rPvWFCdEOLU?t=698) it was debate I did clarify on the  
[0:11:39](https://youtu.be/rPvWFCdEOLU?t=699) community section of the page that this  
[0:11:41](https://youtu.be/rPvWFCdEOLU?t=701) is a discussion it's a response is a  
[0:11:42](https://youtu.be/rPvWFCdEOLU?t=702) reaction video so apologies to anyone  
[0:11:44](https://youtu.be/rPvWFCdEOLU?t=704) that took the wrong end of the stick  
[0:11:46](https://youtu.be/rPvWFCdEOLU?t=706) with in regards to the title but now  
[0:11:48](https://youtu.be/rPvWFCdEOLU?t=708) inshallah let's continue let's play the  
[0:11:50](https://youtu.be/rPvWFCdEOLU?t=710) clip bro you tell me what to stop and  
[0:11:52](https://youtu.be/rPvWFCdEOLU?t=712) there will analyze each section as we go  
[0:11:54](https://youtu.be/rPvWFCdEOLU?t=714) through is the concept of God in Islam  
[0:12:09](https://youtu.be/rPvWFCdEOLU?t=729) the same as the concept of God in  
[0:12:12](https://youtu.be/rPvWFCdEOLU?t=732) Christianity do we have the same  
[0:12:15](https://youtu.be/rPvWFCdEOLU?t=735) understanding of God and there I argued  
[0:12:18](https://youtu.be/rPvWFCdEOLU?t=738) that they are worlds apart that the  
[0:12:21](https://youtu.be/rPvWFCdEOLU?t=741) concept of God and Islam and  
[0:12:23](https://youtu.be/rPvWFCdEOLU?t=743) Christianity is very very different and  
[0:12:25](https://youtu.be/rPvWFCdEOLU?t=745) one of the principal ways in which they  
[0:12:28](https://youtu.be/rPvWFCdEOLU?t=748) are different is that the Muslim concept  
[0:12:32](https://youtu.be/rPvWFCdEOLU?t=752) of God I believe is morally defective it  
[0:12:36](https://youtu.be/rPvWFCdEOLU?t=756) is a morally defective vision of who God  
[0:12:39](https://youtu.be/rPvWFCdEOLU?t=759) is as the greatest conceivable being a  
[0:12:43](https://youtu.be/rPvWFCdEOLU?t=763) morally perfect being God must be all  
[0:12:47](https://youtu.be/rPvWFCdEOLU?t=767) loving and this is exactly what the  
[0:12:52](https://youtu.be/rPvWFCdEOLU?t=772) Bible teaches the Bible teaches that God  
[0:12:54](https://youtu.be/rPvWFCdEOLU?t=774) loves sinners his love is impartial it  
[0:12:58](https://youtu.be/rPvWFCdEOLU?t=778) is universal it is unconditional and  
[0:13:01](https://youtu.be/rPvWFCdEOLU?t=781) this is a world of difference from the  
[0:13:04](https://youtu.be/rPvWFCdEOLU?t=784) god of the Quran according to the Quran  
[0:13:06](https://youtu.be/rPvWFCdEOLU?t=786) God does not love sinners he does not  
[0:13:11](https://youtu.be/rPvWFCdEOLU?t=791) love unbelievers he is an enemy to  
[0:13:14](https://youtu.be/rPvWFCdEOLU?t=794) unbelievers God in the Quran only loves  
[0:13:18](https://youtu.be/rPvWFCdEOLU?t=798) those who first  
[0:13:20](https://youtu.be/rPvWFCdEOLU?t=800) like him okay stop here okay yeah so as  
[0:13:25](https://youtu.be/rPvWFCdEOLU?t=805) we said you know he basically  
[0:13:28](https://youtu.be/rPvWFCdEOLU?t=808) misrepresents Allah in the Islamic  
[0:13:31](https://youtu.be/rPvWFCdEOLU?t=811) tradition God in the Islamic tradition  
[0:13:32](https://youtu.be/rPvWFCdEOLU?t=812) where he's basically saying that God  
[0:13:35](https://youtu.be/rPvWFCdEOLU?t=815) doesn't love sinners he doesn't love  
[0:13:38](https://youtu.be/rPvWFCdEOLU?t=818) those who you know disobey Him the  
[0:13:40](https://youtu.be/rPvWFCdEOLU?t=820) wrongdoers now we have to understand  
[0:13:42](https://youtu.be/rPvWFCdEOLU?t=822) what does he mean by love here because  
[0:13:44](https://youtu.be/rPvWFCdEOLU?t=824) as we said mercy is also a synonym for  
[0:13:47](https://youtu.be/rPvWFCdEOLU?t=827) love so does God have mercy for the  
[0:13:50](https://youtu.be/rPvWFCdEOLU?t=830) disbelievers absolutely we mentioned  
[0:13:52](https://youtu.be/rPvWFCdEOLU?t=832) this in the beginning Allah says his  
[0:13:54](https://youtu.be/rPvWFCdEOLU?t=834) mercy encompasses everything does God  
[0:13:56](https://youtu.be/rPvWFCdEOLU?t=836) have mercy for wrongdoers absolutely now  
[0:13:58](https://youtu.be/rPvWFCdEOLU?t=838) but I also want to challenge his  
[0:14:00](https://youtu.be/rPvWFCdEOLU?t=840) conception of love what type of love are  
[0:14:03](https://youtu.be/rPvWFCdEOLU?t=843) you now talking about because there are  
[0:14:05](https://youtu.be/rPvWFCdEOLU?t=845) different types of love the Islamic  
[0:14:06](https://youtu.be/rPvWFCdEOLU?t=846) tradition is very new in stright we have  
[0:14:10](https://youtu.be/rPvWFCdEOLU?t=850) many names meanings words for love and  
[0:14:14](https://youtu.be/rPvWFCdEOLU?t=854) they have a particular reality now you  
[0:14:17](https://youtu.be/rPvWFCdEOLU?t=857) know it's easy to use the English  
[0:14:19](https://youtu.be/rPvWFCdEOLU?t=859) language they love or would you actually  
[0:14:20](https://youtu.be/rPvWFCdEOLU?t=860) mean so I would I would actually ask him  
[0:14:23](https://youtu.be/rPvWFCdEOLU?t=863) that question because I wait to think  
[0:14:24](https://youtu.be/rPvWFCdEOLU?t=864) about this bro and I wrote this down on  
[0:14:27](https://youtu.be/rPvWFCdEOLU?t=867) my phone just unlock the phone now is it  
[0:14:30](https://youtu.be/rPvWFCdEOLU?t=870) maximal love to love everything the same  
[0:14:34](https://youtu.be/rPvWFCdEOLU?t=874) that's the big question yes and this is  
[0:14:37](https://youtu.be/rPvWFCdEOLU?t=877) the problem because it is not maximum  
[0:14:40](https://youtu.be/rPvWFCdEOLU?t=880) loving to love everything the same can I  
[0:14:42](https://youtu.be/rPvWFCdEOLU?t=882) love goodness the same way as I love  
[0:14:45](https://youtu.be/rPvWFCdEOLU?t=885) badness evil hmm in actual fact would it  
[0:14:49](https://youtu.be/rPvWFCdEOLU?t=889) be loving for me to love evil I mean  
[0:14:52](https://youtu.be/rPvWFCdEOLU?t=892) listening all right so think about this  
[0:14:55](https://youtu.be/rPvWFCdEOLU?t=895) but perfect love is to love goodness to  
[0:14:59](https://youtu.be/rPvWFCdEOLU?t=899) love mercy to love kindness to love  
[0:15:01](https://youtu.be/rPvWFCdEOLU?t=901) connecting with once creator to love  
[0:15:03](https://youtu.be/rPvWFCdEOLU?t=903) peace and it follows that if you love  
[0:15:07](https://youtu.be/rPvWFCdEOLU?t=907) something you have to hate its opposite  
[0:15:09](https://youtu.be/rPvWFCdEOLU?t=909) hmm which means you have to hate evil  
[0:15:12](https://youtu.be/rPvWFCdEOLU?t=912) you have to hate the opposition to love  
[0:15:15](https://youtu.be/rPvWFCdEOLU?t=915) you have to have to hate malevolence you  
[0:15:17](https://youtu.be/rPvWFCdEOLU?t=917) have to hate polytheism you have to hate  
[0:15:19](https://youtu.be/rPvWFCdEOLU?t=919) chaos and destruction are you saying  
[0:15:22](https://youtu.be/rPvWFCdEOLU?t=922) it's perfect maximal love to love that  
[0:15:27](https://youtu.be/rPvWFCdEOLU?t=927) which is a barrier to love I mean this  
[0:15:30](https://youtu.be/rPvWFCdEOLU?t=930) doesn't make sense because if if you  
[0:15:32](https://youtu.be/rPvWFCdEOLU?t=932) love everything  
[0:15:34](https://youtu.be/rPvWFCdEOLU?t=934) then you really don't love anything at  
[0:15:35](https://youtu.be/rPvWFCdEOLU?t=935) all yet you you actually summarized the  
[0:15:40](https://youtu.be/rPvWFCdEOLU?t=940) bed in the way we have summarized yes  
[0:15:44](https://youtu.be/rPvWFCdEOLU?t=944) the second point is on terms like God  
[0:15:46](https://youtu.be/rPvWFCdEOLU?t=946) doesn't love the sinner well what does  
[0:15:47](https://youtu.be/rPvWFCdEOLU?t=947) that really mean doesn't mean God  
[0:15:50](https://youtu.be/rPvWFCdEOLU?t=950) doesn't love the intruder human being  
[0:15:52](https://youtu.be/rPvWFCdEOLU?t=952) what makes it human being the intrinsic  
[0:15:54](https://youtu.be/rPvWFCdEOLU?t=954) value of the human being absolutely not  
[0:15:56](https://youtu.be/rPvWFCdEOLU?t=956) what does Allah say about the human  
[0:15:58](https://youtu.be/rPvWFCdEOLU?t=958) being he has a war he has a soul he has  
[0:16:00](https://youtu.be/rPvWFCdEOLU?t=960) a fitrah and enough fitrah there is  
[0:16:02](https://youtu.be/rPvWFCdEOLU?t=962) goodness that innate disposition has  
[0:16:03](https://youtu.be/rPvWFCdEOLU?t=963) goodness does good hate that no let me  
[0:16:07](https://youtu.be/rPvWFCdEOLU?t=967) tell what good doesn't like God doesn't  
[0:16:10](https://youtu.be/rPvWFCdEOLU?t=970) like the way the human being has  
[0:16:13](https://youtu.be/rPvWFCdEOLU?t=973) identity' identified themselves by  
[0:16:15](https://youtu.be/rPvWFCdEOLU?t=975) virtue of their state of being  
[0:16:17](https://youtu.be/rPvWFCdEOLU?t=977) philosophical but you have to understand  
[0:16:20](https://youtu.be/rPvWFCdEOLU?t=980) this so good doesn't like how we've  
[0:16:22](https://youtu.be/rPvWFCdEOLU?t=982) identified ourselves by virtue of our  
[0:16:24](https://youtu.be/rPvWFCdEOLU?t=984) state of being  
[0:16:25](https://youtu.be/rPvWFCdEOLU?t=985) meaning how we relate to ourselves how  
[0:16:28](https://youtu.be/rPvWFCdEOLU?t=988) to relate to others and how we relate to  
[0:16:30](https://youtu.be/rPvWFCdEOLU?t=990) the Creator so if my relation to myself  
[0:16:33](https://youtu.be/rPvWFCdEOLU?t=993) and my relation to others and my  
[0:16:35](https://youtu.be/rPvWFCdEOLU?t=995) relation to the Creator is not good is  
[0:16:37](https://youtu.be/rPvWFCdEOLU?t=997) evil  
[0:16:38](https://youtu.be/rPvWFCdEOLU?t=998) why would good like that that's not an  
[0:16:42](https://youtu.be/rPvWFCdEOLU?t=1002) expression of match of maximal  
[0:16:43](https://youtu.be/rPvWFCdEOLU?t=1003) perfection yes and even though God would  
[0:16:45](https://youtu.be/rPvWFCdEOLU?t=1005) not love that he still has another type  
[0:16:48](https://youtu.be/rPvWFCdEOLU?t=1008) of love if you like which is he still  
[0:16:50](https://youtu.be/rPvWFCdEOLU?t=1010) has mercy for the one who relates to  
[0:16:52](https://youtu.be/rPvWFCdEOLU?t=1012) himself relates to others and relates to  
[0:16:55](https://youtu.be/rPvWFCdEOLU?t=1015) the divine in an evil way so this is a  
[0:16:57](https://youtu.be/rPvWFCdEOLU?t=1017) new it discussion and wouldn't mean  
[0:17:01](https://youtu.be/rPvWFCdEOLU?t=1021) Craig unfortunately to not get Islam Jui  
[0:17:04](https://youtu.be/rPvWFCdEOLU?t=1024) justice especially since you know he's  
[0:17:07](https://youtu.be/rPvWFCdEOLU?t=1027) grateful for the likes of Alan Mulally  
[0:17:09](https://youtu.be/rPvWFCdEOLU?t=1029) the 11th century theologian and what  
[0:17:11](https://youtu.be/rPvWFCdEOLU?t=1031) baffles me Habibi ya Rudy Iran what  
[0:17:14](https://youtu.be/rPvWFCdEOLU?t=1034) baffles me alakazoo Lee himself hero his  
[0:17:17](https://youtu.be/rPvWFCdEOLU?t=1037) idea his compendium sre his a revival of  
[0:17:21](https://youtu.be/rPvWFCdEOLU?t=1041) the religious Sciences in the 36 vol  
[0:17:24](https://youtu.be/rPvWFCdEOLU?t=1044) what does he write about he writes about  
[0:17:27](https://youtu.be/rPvWFCdEOLU?t=1047) Mahatma love intimacy contentment with  
[0:17:32](https://youtu.be/rPvWFCdEOLU?t=1052) Allah subhana WA Ta'ala and that book he  
[0:17:35](https://youtu.be/rPvWFCdEOLU?t=1055) talks about he affirms Allah is and  
[0:17:37](https://youtu.be/rPvWFCdEOLU?t=1057) wudood he is loving and he loves and  
[0:17:39](https://youtu.be/rPvWFCdEOLU?t=1059) they can be a loving relationship  
[0:17:40](https://youtu.be/rPvWFCdEOLU?t=1060) between creation and the Creator that's  
[0:17:45](https://youtu.be/rPvWFCdEOLU?t=1065) his own teacher William  
[0:17:48](https://youtu.be/rPvWFCdEOLU?t=1068) teacher alaa ghazzal ii wrote about this  
[0:17:51](https://youtu.be/rPvWFCdEOLU?t=1071) you didn't have to go too far to  
[0:17:53](https://youtu.be/rPvWFCdEOLU?t=1073) understand that Allah is Allah dude  
[0:17:54](https://youtu.be/rPvWFCdEOLU?t=1074) they're loving and he says that his  
[0:17:57](https://youtu.be/rPvWFCdEOLU?t=1077) mercy encompasses everything so from  
[0:18:00](https://youtu.be/rPvWFCdEOLU?t=1080) that point of view I would even say that  
[0:18:03](https://youtu.be/rPvWFCdEOLU?t=1083) the way his understanding God's love is  
[0:18:05](https://youtu.be/rPvWFCdEOLU?t=1085) not maximally perfect hmm is he  
[0:18:08](https://youtu.be/rPvWFCdEOLU?t=1088) absolutely bro and just let me just I  
[0:18:10](https://youtu.be/rPvWFCdEOLU?t=1090) guess paint that easily and in a  
[0:18:12](https://youtu.be/rPvWFCdEOLU?t=1092) slightly different way so we can really  
[0:18:13](https://youtu.be/rPvWFCdEOLU?t=1093) get the point across the people it's  
[0:18:15](https://youtu.be/rPvWFCdEOLU?t=1095) like it's what we're saying is from the  
[0:18:17](https://youtu.be/rPvWFCdEOLU?t=1097) Islamic perspective or Lazcano dollars  
[0:18:18](https://youtu.be/rPvWFCdEOLU?t=1098) maximally perfect love is in line with  
[0:18:20](https://youtu.be/rPvWFCdEOLU?t=1100) his name's and attributes number one and  
[0:18:22](https://youtu.be/rPvWFCdEOLU?t=1102) number two it's in line with the  
[0:18:24](https://youtu.be/rPvWFCdEOLU?t=1104) objective that is created this world for  
[0:18:26](https://youtu.be/rPvWFCdEOLU?t=1106) Allah tells us for example in surah mulk  
[0:18:28](https://youtu.be/rPvWFCdEOLU?t=1108) that he created life and death to test  
[0:18:30](https://youtu.be/rPvWFCdEOLU?t=1110) which of us is best in deeds therefore  
[0:18:32](https://youtu.be/rPvWFCdEOLU?t=1112) God has created us in this world he's  
[0:18:33](https://youtu.be/rPvWFCdEOLU?t=1113) made his agents with freewill and he  
[0:18:36](https://youtu.be/rPvWFCdEOLU?t=1116) wants us to do good and stay away from  
[0:18:37](https://youtu.be/rPvWFCdEOLU?t=1117) evil now if God has created us for that  
[0:18:40](https://youtu.be/rPvWFCdEOLU?t=1120) reason then why would this very same God  
[0:18:42](https://youtu.be/rPvWFCdEOLU?t=1122) with claiming is maximally perfect and  
[0:18:44](https://youtu.be/rPvWFCdEOLU?t=1124) maximum loving at the same time express  
[0:18:47](https://youtu.be/rPvWFCdEOLU?t=1127) his love to creation in a way which  
[0:18:49](https://youtu.be/rPvWFCdEOLU?t=1129) undermines the whole project because if  
[0:18:51](https://youtu.be/rPvWFCdEOLU?t=1131) he loves if he loves the sinner or the  
[0:18:54](https://youtu.be/rPvWFCdEOLU?t=1134) Hitler as much as he loves the mother  
[0:18:56](https://youtu.be/rPvWFCdEOLU?t=1136) Teresa or the saint whether where is the  
[0:18:58](https://youtu.be/rPvWFCdEOLU?t=1138) objective where is that where is the  
[0:18:59](https://youtu.be/rPvWFCdEOLU?t=1139) motivation for the the saint to continue  
[0:19:02](https://youtu.be/rPvWFCdEOLU?t=1142) to be good and to continue on that path  
[0:19:03](https://youtu.be/rPvWFCdEOLU?t=1143) and where where is the motivation broke  
[0:19:05](https://youtu.be/rPvWFCdEOLU?t=1145) for the the sinner and the Hitler to  
[0:19:08](https://youtu.be/rPvWFCdEOLU?t=1148) leave the sin and to become good right  
[0:19:10](https://youtu.be/rPvWFCdEOLU?t=1150) and I really believe bro when Allah says  
[0:19:13](https://youtu.be/rPvWFCdEOLU?t=1153) he does not love the disbeliever for  
[0:19:15](https://youtu.be/rPvWFCdEOLU?t=1155) example in the 3rd chapter of the Quran  
[0:19:16](https://youtu.be/rPvWFCdEOLU?t=1156) verse 32 where he says he does not love  
[0:19:19](https://youtu.be/rPvWFCdEOLU?t=1159) the disbeliever this in a way is acts as  
[0:19:21](https://youtu.be/rPvWFCdEOLU?t=1161) a motivation for the disbeliever to  
[0:19:24](https://youtu.be/rPvWFCdEOLU?t=1164) leave that state like you mentioned and  
[0:19:25](https://youtu.be/rPvWFCdEOLU?t=1165) adopt the state of absolutely right and  
[0:19:28](https://youtu.be/rPvWFCdEOLU?t=1168) notice that it also means that it  
[0:19:30](https://youtu.be/rPvWFCdEOLU?t=1170) doesn't mean though that does Allah  
[0:19:32](https://youtu.be/rPvWFCdEOLU?t=1172) doesn't have another intense mercy for  
[0:19:34](https://youtu.be/rPvWFCdEOLU?t=1174) the disappear of course Allah has  
[0:19:35](https://youtu.be/rPvWFCdEOLU?t=1175) intense mercy for the disbeliever  
[0:19:37](https://youtu.be/rPvWFCdEOLU?t=1177) because we said there's many grades of  
[0:19:40](https://youtu.be/rPvWFCdEOLU?t=1180) mercy and love in the enzyme a condition  
[0:19:41](https://youtu.be/rPvWFCdEOLU?t=1181) is very newest but bro you you've opened  
[0:19:43](https://youtu.be/rPvWFCdEOLU?t=1183) a massive can of worms philosophical  
[0:19:45](https://youtu.be/rPvWFCdEOLU?t=1185) bondage is amazing not for us for the  
[0:19:48](https://youtu.be/rPvWFCdEOLU?t=1188) dr. Craig conception of theology moral  
[0:19:52](https://youtu.be/rPvWFCdEOLU?t=1192) duties don't make sense anymore yes  
[0:19:55](https://youtu.be/rPvWFCdEOLU?t=1195) because what is that that pressing alt  
[0:19:58](https://youtu.be/rPvWFCdEOLU?t=1198) that we ought to do something  
[0:19:59](https://youtu.be/rPvWFCdEOLU?t=1199) if Allah  
[0:20:00](https://youtu.be/rPvWFCdEOLU?t=1200) the sinner everybody in that way then  
[0:20:04](https://youtu.be/rPvWFCdEOLU?t=1204) you know in the Christian tradition I'm  
[0:20:05](https://youtu.be/rPvWFCdEOLU?t=1205) fine I'll go kill a thousand people  
[0:20:07](https://youtu.be/rPvWFCdEOLU?t=1207) right and I just believe that Jesus  
[0:20:09](https://youtu.be/rPvWFCdEOLU?t=1209) sacrifices is life for me no problem  
[0:20:11](https://youtu.be/rPvWFCdEOLU?t=1211) then I'm okay as you said yesterday it's  
[0:20:15](https://youtu.be/rPvWFCdEOLU?t=1215) a form of you told me your religious  
[0:20:17](https://youtu.be/rPvWFCdEOLU?t=1217) nihilism that's perfect religious  
[0:20:20](https://youtu.be/rPvWFCdEOLU?t=1220) nihilism nihilism yeah which is  
[0:20:23](https://youtu.be/rPvWFCdEOLU?t=1223) absolutely really really really powerful  
[0:20:25](https://youtu.be/rPvWFCdEOLU?t=1225) yeah so yeah we're also also bro you  
[0:20:28](https://youtu.be/rPvWFCdEOLU?t=1228) know when and this is another one want  
[0:20:30](https://youtu.be/rPvWFCdEOLU?t=1230) people to think of it when Allah says  
[0:20:31](https://youtu.be/rPvWFCdEOLU?t=1231) he's that does not love the disbeliever  
[0:20:33](https://youtu.be/rPvWFCdEOLU?t=1233) this is Allah's love being expressed to  
[0:20:36](https://youtu.be/rPvWFCdEOLU?t=1236) the disbelief in a way because it's his  
[0:20:38](https://youtu.be/rPvWFCdEOLU?t=1238) loving mercy which makes the pet the  
[0:20:41](https://youtu.be/rPvWFCdEOLU?t=1241) disbeliever think oh my God my God does  
[0:20:43](https://youtu.be/rPvWFCdEOLU?t=1243) not love me  
[0:20:43](https://youtu.be/rPvWFCdEOLU?t=1243) it hits him deep inside his fitrah and  
[0:20:45](https://youtu.be/rPvWFCdEOLU?t=1245) this will encourage him to rectify him  
[0:20:47](https://youtu.be/rPvWFCdEOLU?t=1247) that's a very good point but you could  
[0:20:49](https://youtu.be/rPvWFCdEOLU?t=1249) articulate this way as well so see it  
[0:20:53](https://youtu.be/rPvWFCdEOLU?t=1253) say disbelieve is someone who doesn't  
[0:20:55](https://youtu.be/rPvWFCdEOLU?t=1255) who rejects the truth is listening to  
[0:20:57](https://youtu.be/rPvWFCdEOLU?t=1257) this so Allah has intense mercy for you  
[0:21:00](https://youtu.be/rPvWFCdEOLU?t=1260) but you won't have a the the  
[0:21:04](https://youtu.be/rPvWFCdEOLU?t=1264) relationship of special love with him  
[0:21:06](https://youtu.be/rPvWFCdEOLU?t=1266) unless you accept the truth and you  
[0:21:09](https://youtu.be/rPvWFCdEOLU?t=1269) accept the fact that he's the only date  
[0:21:10](https://youtu.be/rPvWFCdEOLU?t=1270) you worthy of worship and that Muhammad  
[0:21:12](https://youtu.be/rPvWFCdEOLU?t=1272) the final prophet that should be  
[0:21:14](https://youtu.be/rPvWFCdEOLU?t=1274) motivating because it's not it's not  
[0:21:16](https://youtu.be/rPvWFCdEOLU?t=1276) from that point of view that you are  
[0:21:18](https://youtu.be/rPvWFCdEOLU?t=1278) discarded intrinsically as a human being  
[0:21:21](https://youtu.be/rPvWFCdEOLU?t=1281) the way you've identified yourself and  
[0:21:24](https://youtu.be/rPvWFCdEOLU?t=1284) how you relate yourself and others and  
[0:21:26](https://youtu.be/rPvWFCdEOLU?t=1286) Allah is something that is not loved at  
[0:21:29](https://youtu.be/rPvWFCdEOLU?t=1289) all and if you only be in a state of  
[0:21:31](https://youtu.be/rPvWFCdEOLU?t=1291) being that is love and you answer to  
[0:21:33](https://youtu.be/rPvWFCdEOLU?t=1293) that love in relation with Allah then  
[0:21:35](https://youtu.be/rPvWFCdEOLU?t=1295) you have to do X Y & Z yeah so yeah  
[0:21:37](https://youtu.be/rPvWFCdEOLU?t=1297) absolutely absolutely so I think we  
[0:21:40](https://youtu.be/rPvWFCdEOLU?t=1300) should just going back on the point that  
[0:21:41](https://youtu.be/rPvWFCdEOLU?t=1301) if you love everything the same you  
[0:21:44](https://youtu.be/rPvWFCdEOLU?t=1304) don't love anything at all  
[0:21:45](https://youtu.be/rPvWFCdEOLU?t=1305) yeah you've undermined the whole human  
[0:21:47](https://youtu.be/rPvWFCdEOLU?t=1307) project from that perspective and and  
[0:21:48](https://youtu.be/rPvWFCdEOLU?t=1308) that in itself would be a sign that will  
[0:21:51](https://youtu.be/rPvWFCdEOLU?t=1311) you in a way you be claiming that the  
[0:21:53](https://youtu.be/rPvWFCdEOLU?t=1313) maximally perfect being is not maximally  
[0:21:55](https://youtu.be/rPvWFCdEOLU?t=1315) perfect yeah that was the way he  
[0:21:57](https://youtu.be/rPvWFCdEOLU?t=1317) expressed his love to creation yeah  
[0:21:58](https://youtu.be/rPvWFCdEOLU?t=1318) because yeah a maximum perfect being  
[0:22:00](https://youtu.be/rPvWFCdEOLU?t=1320) doesn't love everything the same yeah  
[0:22:02](https://youtu.be/rPvWFCdEOLU?t=1322) and and and yes does a maximum profit  
[0:22:04](https://youtu.be/rPvWFCdEOLU?t=1324) being have mercy for everything  
[0:22:06](https://youtu.be/rPvWFCdEOLU?t=1326) absolutely just like Allah says he has a  
[0:22:07](https://youtu.be/rPvWFCdEOLU?t=1327) mercy for everything the sinner the  
[0:22:09](https://youtu.be/rPvWFCdEOLU?t=1329) evildoer the believer but does Allah  
[0:22:11](https://youtu.be/rPvWFCdEOLU?t=1331) have that special love for everything  
[0:22:13](https://youtu.be/rPvWFCdEOLU?t=1333) the same of  
[0:22:13](https://youtu.be/rPvWFCdEOLU?t=1333) course no because if that's the case you  
[0:22:15](https://youtu.be/rPvWFCdEOLU?t=1335) don't really love anything at all  
[0:22:16](https://youtu.be/rPvWFCdEOLU?t=1336) because as we mentioned maximal perfect  
[0:22:18](https://youtu.be/rPvWFCdEOLU?t=1338) love means that you love goodness and  
[0:22:20](https://youtu.be/rPvWFCdEOLU?t=1340) therefore you should hate the opposite  
[0:22:22](https://youtu.be/rPvWFCdEOLU?t=1342) of that which is evil yep so from that  
[0:22:25](https://youtu.be/rPvWFCdEOLU?t=1345) point of view I think his assumption is  
[0:22:28](https://youtu.be/rPvWFCdEOLU?t=1348) false  
[0:22:28](https://youtu.be/rPvWFCdEOLU?t=1348) maybe this continued inshallah  
[0:22:31](https://youtu.be/rPvWFCdEOLU?t=1351) let me play a section jesus said tax  
[0:22:41](https://youtu.be/rPvWFCdEOLU?t=1361) collectors and sinners exhibit they love  
[0:22:45](https://youtu.be/rPvWFCdEOLU?t=1365) those who love them and that's the kind  
[0:22:48](https://youtu.be/rPvWFCdEOLU?t=1368) of love that the god of the Quran  
[0:22:50](https://youtu.be/rPvWFCdEOLU?t=1370) exhibits so the Quran assures us it's  
[0:22:55](https://youtu.be/rPvWFCdEOLU?t=1375) just so so by this alright I'm fearing  
[0:22:57](https://youtu.be/rPvWFCdEOLU?t=1377) and the this we have to hold a we have  
[0:23:02](https://youtu.be/rPvWFCdEOLU?t=1382) to just say no here this this is this is  
[0:23:04](https://youtu.be/rPvWFCdEOLU?t=1384) almost the cheeky how can you say the  
[0:23:09](https://youtu.be/rPvWFCdEOLU?t=1389) God of Islam his love is like the love  
[0:23:12](https://youtu.be/rPvWFCdEOLU?t=1392) of the tax collector their sinner what  
[0:23:14](https://youtu.be/rPvWFCdEOLU?t=1394) we've said already undermines that  
[0:23:15](https://youtu.be/rPvWFCdEOLU?t=1395) because God's mercy would invest he's a  
[0:23:17](https://youtu.be/rPvWFCdEOLU?t=1397) synonym synonym of love he's intense  
[0:23:19](https://youtu.be/rPvWFCdEOLU?t=1399) Macy's for everything the sinner the  
[0:23:21](https://youtu.be/rPvWFCdEOLU?t=1401) evildoer and the good one but I would  
[0:23:23](https://youtu.be/rPvWFCdEOLU?t=1403) admit to something here in actual fact  
[0:23:25](https://youtu.be/rPvWFCdEOLU?t=1405) he is a victim of his own criticism why  
[0:23:27](https://youtu.be/rPvWFCdEOLU?t=1407) because remember maximal of intones  
[0:23:31](https://youtu.be/rPvWFCdEOLU?t=1411) maximum forgiveness good in the biblical  
[0:23:34](https://youtu.be/rPvWFCdEOLU?t=1414) tradition is not maximally forgiving his  
[0:23:36](https://youtu.be/rPvWFCdEOLU?t=1416) forgiveness in other words the way he  
[0:23:39](https://youtu.be/rPvWFCdEOLU?t=1419) expresses his love is worse than any  
[0:23:42](https://youtu.be/rPvWFCdEOLU?t=1422) type of human forgiveness bro if I did  
[0:23:45](https://youtu.be/rPvWFCdEOLU?t=1425) you wrong and you said to me I would  
[0:23:48](https://youtu.be/rPvWFCdEOLU?t=1428) only forgive you if someone's son is  
[0:23:51](https://youtu.be/rPvWFCdEOLU?t=1431) sacrificed and you have to believe that  
[0:23:54](https://youtu.be/rPvWFCdEOLU?t=1434) I haven't happened  
[0:23:55](https://youtu.be/rPvWFCdEOLU?t=1435) yeah and by you accepting that I then I  
[0:23:58](https://youtu.be/rPvWFCdEOLU?t=1438) will forgive you is that forgiveness  
[0:24:01](https://youtu.be/rPvWFCdEOLU?t=1441) well that's not that's not adequate for  
[0:24:03](https://youtu.be/rPvWFCdEOLU?t=1443) limited human beings how can you apply  
[0:24:05](https://youtu.be/rPvWFCdEOLU?t=1445) that to the creator of the heavens and  
[0:24:06](https://youtu.be/rPvWFCdEOLU?t=1446) thank you very much this is what you  
[0:24:08](https://youtu.be/rPvWFCdEOLU?t=1448) call a mic drop philosophically it's not  
[0:24:10](https://youtu.be/rPvWFCdEOLU?t=1450) mic is a pen but you get my point  
[0:24:12](https://youtu.be/rPvWFCdEOLU?t=1452) yes I think what Craig has done here is  
[0:24:16](https://youtu.be/rPvWFCdEOLU?t=1456) philosophically theologically  
[0:24:18](https://youtu.be/rPvWFCdEOLU?t=1458) spiritually unacceptable yeah it's it's  
[0:24:22](https://youtu.be/rPvWFCdEOLU?t=1462) it's bordering literally a joke and it's  
[0:24:24](https://youtu.be/rPvWFCdEOLU?t=1464) unfortunate that you and this is what  
[0:24:26](https://youtu.be/rPvWFCdEOLU?t=1466) one of the things that really shocked  
[0:24:27](https://youtu.be/rPvWFCdEOLU?t=1467) bro was someone of his caliber would  
[0:24:30](https://youtu.be/rPvWFCdEOLU?t=1470) would would would make such statements  
[0:24:33](https://youtu.be/rPvWFCdEOLU?t=1473) publicly not doing his research you know  
[0:24:36](https://youtu.be/rPvWFCdEOLU?t=1476) that and you see this over and over  
[0:24:37](https://youtu.be/rPvWFCdEOLU?t=1477) again and that's what shocking spun but  
[0:24:39](https://youtu.be/rPvWFCdEOLU?t=1479) anyway let's finish off what he's saying  
[0:24:40](https://youtu.be/rPvWFCdEOLU?t=1480) let me play the rest the clip for you  
[0:24:45](https://youtu.be/rPvWFCdEOLU?t=1485) for the god-fearing and the good doers  
[0:24:48](https://youtu.be/rPvWFCdEOLU?t=1488) but he has no love for sinners and  
[0:24:51](https://youtu.be/rPvWFCdEOLU?t=1491) unbelievers the Quran says that God does  
[0:24:56](https://youtu.be/rPvWFCdEOLU?t=1496) not love the very people that John 3:16  
[0:25:01](https://youtu.be/rPvWFCdEOLU?t=1501) says God loves so much that he sent His  
[0:25:05](https://youtu.be/rPvWFCdEOLU?t=1505) only Son to die for them while we were  
[0:25:08](https://youtu.be/rPvWFCdEOLU?t=1508) yet enemies Christ died for us so this  
[0:25:12](https://youtu.be/rPvWFCdEOLU?t=1512) will be a severe blow  
[0:25:14](https://youtu.be/rPvWFCdEOLU?t=1514) yep ok so John 3:16 that God loved us so  
[0:25:17](https://youtu.be/rPvWFCdEOLU?t=1517) much that he basically sacrificed his  
[0:25:19](https://youtu.be/rPvWFCdEOLU?t=1519) only Son for us right now there's  
[0:25:22](https://youtu.be/rPvWFCdEOLU?t=1522) another dimension to this which doesn't  
[0:25:24](https://youtu.be/rPvWFCdEOLU?t=1524) directly relate to what we're talking  
[0:25:26](https://youtu.be/rPvWFCdEOLU?t=1526) about it's still very significant  
[0:25:27](https://youtu.be/rPvWFCdEOLU?t=1527) important because it  
[0:25:28](https://youtu.be/rPvWFCdEOLU?t=1528) you know John 3:16 is supposed to be  
[0:25:31](https://youtu.be/rPvWFCdEOLU?t=1531) this amazing thing and that you know the  
[0:25:32](https://youtu.be/rPvWFCdEOLU?t=1532) Christians have a monopoly on a loving  
[0:25:34](https://youtu.be/rPvWFCdEOLU?t=1534) relationship with the divine I am sorry  
[0:25:36](https://youtu.be/rPvWFCdEOLU?t=1536) this is not the case at all John 3:16  
[0:25:39](https://youtu.be/rPvWFCdEOLU?t=1539) actually shows that there is no maximum  
[0:25:42](https://youtu.be/rPvWFCdEOLU?t=1542) forgiveness a maximal love in the  
[0:25:44](https://youtu.be/rPvWFCdEOLU?t=1544) biblical tradition with regards to the  
[0:25:46](https://youtu.be/rPvWFCdEOLU?t=1546) conception of the divine why am I saying  
[0:25:48](https://youtu.be/rPvWFCdEOLU?t=1548) this because if if God sacrificed his  
[0:25:51](https://youtu.be/rPvWFCdEOLU?t=1551) son for human sin then isn't me not  
[0:25:55](https://youtu.be/rPvWFCdEOLU?t=1555) believing in Christianity as sin me  
[0:25:57](https://youtu.be/rPvWFCdEOLU?t=1557) being a Muslim isn't that sin so by  
[0:26:00](https://youtu.be/rPvWFCdEOLU?t=1560) virtue of that I should be okay right  
[0:26:03](https://youtu.be/rPvWFCdEOLU?t=1563) yep  
[0:26:04](https://youtu.be/rPvWFCdEOLU?t=1564) didn't Jesus sacrifice it wasn't he  
[0:26:06](https://youtu.be/rPvWFCdEOLU?t=1566) sacrificed for me as well yep me to be a  
[0:26:09](https://youtu.be/rPvWFCdEOLU?t=1569) Muslim is that sinful according to the  
[0:26:10](https://youtu.be/rPvWFCdEOLU?t=1570) Christian tradition mainstream biblical  
[0:26:13](https://youtu.be/rPvWFCdEOLU?t=1573) Christian to say Imran Hamza you know  
[0:26:15](https://youtu.be/rPvWFCdEOLU?t=1575) you guys are sinners because one you  
[0:26:19](https://youtu.be/rPvWFCdEOLU?t=1579) have inherent sin and you don't follow  
[0:26:21](https://youtu.be/rPvWFCdEOLU?t=1581) Jesus you follow Islam which too many  
[0:26:23](https://youtu.be/rPvWFCdEOLU?t=1583) Christians would say it's not the truth  
[0:26:25](https://youtu.be/rPvWFCdEOLU?t=1585) and that's fine but then I would say  
[0:26:30](https://youtu.be/rPvWFCdEOLU?t=1590) well didn't Jesus die and get sacrificed  
[0:26:32](https://youtu.be/rPvWFCdEOLU?t=1592) for me for this thing if they say yes  
[0:26:35](https://youtu.be/rPvWFCdEOLU?t=1595) then do I have to accept Jesus they will  
[0:26:39](https://youtu.be/rPvWFCdEOLU?t=1599) say no no no no it  
[0:26:40](https://youtu.be/rPvWFCdEOLU?t=1600) it's a gift you have to accept the gift  
[0:26:42](https://youtu.be/rPvWFCdEOLU?t=1602) you have to accept they actually  
[0:26:44](https://youtu.be/rPvWFCdEOLU?t=1604) happened but for me doesn't that really  
[0:26:47](https://youtu.be/rPvWFCdEOLU?t=1607) devalue the intrinsic nature of the  
[0:26:50](https://youtu.be/rPvWFCdEOLU?t=1610) sacrifice yeah  
[0:26:53](https://youtu.be/rPvWFCdEOLU?t=1613) Craig's original point gods yes but we  
[0:26:55](https://youtu.be/rPvWFCdEOLU?t=1615) just across-the-board equal in the same  
[0:26:57](https://youtu.be/rPvWFCdEOLU?t=1617) at all times  
[0:26:58](https://youtu.be/rPvWFCdEOLU?t=1618) yeah that's applied to use often and  
[0:26:59](https://youtu.be/rPvWFCdEOLU?t=1619) occasion issue it should apply to the  
[0:27:04](https://youtu.be/rPvWFCdEOLU?t=1624) manifestation of his love which is a  
[0:27:06](https://youtu.be/rPvWFCdEOLU?t=1626) sacrifice if the manifestation of his  
[0:27:09](https://youtu.be/rPvWFCdEOLU?t=1629) love which is the sacrifice doesn't have  
[0:27:10](https://youtu.be/rPvWFCdEOLU?t=1630) intrinsic value because it's also  
[0:27:13](https://youtu.be/rPvWFCdEOLU?t=1633) contingent on me accepting him which is  
[0:27:15](https://youtu.be/rPvWFCdEOLU?t=1635) a historical event which is based on a  
[0:27:17](https://youtu.be/rPvWFCdEOLU?t=1637) text that is historically inaccurate has  
[0:27:20](https://youtu.be/rPvWFCdEOLU?t=1640) textual integrity problems X Y & Z then  
[0:27:23](https://youtu.be/rPvWFCdEOLU?t=1643) how is that maximal love and and and how  
[0:27:27](https://youtu.be/rPvWFCdEOLU?t=1647) does that make the event so special when  
[0:27:29](https://youtu.be/rPvWFCdEOLU?t=1649) now not only must have event happen but  
[0:27:32](https://youtu.be/rPvWFCdEOLU?t=1652) I have to acknowledge the event and  
[0:27:34](https://youtu.be/rPvWFCdEOLU?t=1654) accept the event at the same time so I  
[0:27:37](https://youtu.be/rPvWFCdEOLU?t=1657) would say that's in some way obviously  
[0:27:40](https://youtu.be/rPvWFCdEOLU?t=1660) needs more theological and philosophical  
[0:27:41](https://youtu.be/rPvWFCdEOLU?t=1661) unpacking but in some way it really  
[0:27:43](https://youtu.be/rPvWFCdEOLU?t=1663) diminishes what is saying about John  
[0:27:47](https://youtu.be/rPvWFCdEOLU?t=1667) 3:16 in actual fact let's go back to the  
[0:27:50](https://youtu.be/rPvWFCdEOLU?t=1670) whole forgiveness maximum Milagritos  
[0:27:52](https://youtu.be/rPvWFCdEOLU?t=1672) maximal forgiveness well how is this  
[0:27:54](https://youtu.be/rPvWFCdEOLU?t=1674) maximally forgiving he is well firstly  
[0:27:58](https://youtu.be/rPvWFCdEOLU?t=1678) he's not even maximally just right  
[0:28:00](https://youtu.be/rPvWFCdEOLU?t=1680) because he is blaming someone else he is  
[0:28:03](https://youtu.be/rPvWFCdEOLU?t=1683) blaming someone that doesn't deserve the  
[0:28:05](https://youtu.be/rPvWFCdEOLU?t=1685) blame and he is torturing and he is  
[0:28:08](https://youtu.be/rPvWFCdEOLU?t=1688) sacrificing someone that did it that  
[0:28:11](https://youtu.be/rPvWFCdEOLU?t=1691) doesn't deserve this the torturing and  
[0:28:13](https://youtu.be/rPvWFCdEOLU?t=1693) the sacrifice so how is that maximum  
[0:28:16](https://youtu.be/rPvWFCdEOLU?t=1696) forgiveness and maximal justice the  
[0:28:18](https://youtu.be/rPvWFCdEOLU?t=1698) other thing is it's not maximal  
[0:28:21](https://youtu.be/rPvWFCdEOLU?t=1701) forgiveness because the forgiveness of  
[0:28:22](https://youtu.be/rPvWFCdEOLU?t=1702) me as a human being is contingent on an  
[0:28:25](https://youtu.be/rPvWFCdEOLU?t=1705) event outside of my relation to the  
[0:28:27](https://youtu.be/rPvWFCdEOLU?t=1707) divine and it's contingent on me  
[0:28:29](https://youtu.be/rPvWFCdEOLU?t=1709) accepting it but with regards to the  
[0:28:32](https://youtu.be/rPvWFCdEOLU?t=1712) Islamic tradition maximal forgiveness is  
[0:28:35](https://youtu.be/rPvWFCdEOLU?t=1715) manifested itself why because it just  
[0:28:37](https://youtu.be/rPvWFCdEOLU?t=1717) requires me and my heart to do Toba is  
[0:28:40](https://youtu.be/rPvWFCdEOLU?t=1720) the bar to turn back to God to ask for  
[0:28:43](https://youtu.be/rPvWFCdEOLU?t=1723) his forgiveness I don't need a sacrifice  
[0:28:45](https://youtu.be/rPvWFCdEOLU?t=1725) outside of me and because the wages of  
[0:28:49](https://youtu.be/rPvWFCdEOLU?t=1729) sin is death sin is so bad that you know  
[0:28:53](https://youtu.be/rPvWFCdEOLU?t=1733) you have to  
[0:28:54](https://youtu.be/rPvWFCdEOLU?t=1734) some kind of blood sacrifice yeah which  
[0:28:56](https://youtu.be/rPvWFCdEOLU?t=1736) really the biblical tradition is saying  
[0:28:58](https://youtu.be/rPvWFCdEOLU?t=1738) that God that human sin límites God's  
[0:29:01](https://youtu.be/rPvWFCdEOLU?t=1741) mercy online and and that's a national  
[0:29:03](https://youtu.be/rPvWFCdEOLU?t=1743) Islamic tradition so which is more  
[0:29:06](https://youtu.be/rPvWFCdEOLU?t=1746) loving and forgiving good God which one  
[0:29:09](https://youtu.be/rPvWFCdEOLU?t=1749) is it why and this is why Muslims should  
[0:29:12](https://youtu.be/rPvWFCdEOLU?t=1752) talk about this mourn we don't  
[0:29:14](https://youtu.be/rPvWFCdEOLU?t=1754) unfortunately because we have a very  
[0:29:16](https://youtu.be/rPvWFCdEOLU?t=1756) deep loving type of tradition and it's  
[0:29:20](https://youtu.be/rPvWFCdEOLU?t=1760) manifested in our history I want to read  
[0:29:22](https://youtu.be/rPvWFCdEOLU?t=1762) something she grows very quickly yeah  
[0:29:23](https://youtu.be/rPvWFCdEOLU?t=1763) it's actually a historical narrative is  
[0:29:26](https://youtu.be/rPvWFCdEOLU?t=1766) based on the Jewish poet right a Jewish  
[0:29:29](https://youtu.be/rPvWFCdEOLU?t=1769) poet you know our Jewish cousins yeah  
[0:29:32](https://youtu.be/rPvWFCdEOLU?t=1772) let me tell one about Jewish cousins  
[0:29:34](https://youtu.be/rPvWFCdEOLU?t=1774) what he said he probably and sisters  
[0:29:36](https://youtu.be/rPvWFCdEOLU?t=1776) while Hamza is bringing you up if you  
[0:29:40](https://youtu.be/rPvWFCdEOLU?t=1780) have any questions please hold off I'll  
[0:29:41](https://youtu.be/rPvWFCdEOLU?t=1781) tell you guys we're gonna do questions  
[0:29:42](https://youtu.be/rPvWFCdEOLU?t=1782) at the end inshallah  
[0:29:43](https://youtu.be/rPvWFCdEOLU?t=1783) so just repost them if you post them  
[0:29:45](https://youtu.be/rPvWFCdEOLU?t=1785) already and we'll address the Machado

[0:29:53](https://youtu.be/rPvWFCdEOLU?t=1793) in China gone wrong sorry so in the  
[0:29:55](https://youtu.be/rPvWFCdEOLU?t=1795) Christian tradition the Holy Spirit is  
[0:29:57](https://youtu.be/rPvWFCdEOLU?t=1797) supposed to be working right in you know  
[0:29:59](https://youtu.be/rPvWFCdEOLU?t=1799) in the in the present tense and  
[0:30:00](https://youtu.be/rPvWFCdEOLU?t=1800) throughout history but every time the  
[0:30:03](https://youtu.be/rPvWFCdEOLU?t=1803) Christians have always been in power  
[0:30:04](https://youtu.be/rPvWFCdEOLU?t=1804) especially the medieval Catholic Church  
[0:30:06](https://youtu.be/rPvWFCdEOLU?t=1806) it's it's it's not being very loving at  
[0:30:08](https://youtu.be/rPvWFCdEOLU?t=1808) all I mean we don't have to talk about  
[0:30:12](https://youtu.be/rPvWFCdEOLU?t=1812) when Christianity was in power what  
[0:30:14](https://youtu.be/rPvWFCdEOLU?t=1814) happened here look what happened in in  
[0:30:16](https://youtu.be/rPvWFCdEOLU?t=1816) Spain we know what happened in Spain  
[0:30:19](https://youtu.be/rPvWFCdEOLU?t=1819) what was it called it was called the  
[0:30:21](https://youtu.be/rPvWFCdEOLU?t=1821) super I forgot the name for the the  
[0:30:24](https://youtu.be/rPvWFCdEOLU?t=1824) Inquisition right killing the Jews and  
[0:30:28](https://youtu.be/rPvWFCdEOLU?t=1828) the Muslims right and the Jews had to go  
[0:30:30](https://youtu.be/rPvWFCdEOLU?t=1830) to instable and Turkey and their Jewish  
[0:30:32](https://youtu.be/rPvWFCdEOLU?t=1832) rabbi he says come to the land of the  
[0:30:34](https://youtu.be/rPvWFCdEOLU?t=1834) Turks rich are the fruits of the earth  
[0:30:36](https://youtu.be/rPvWFCdEOLU?t=1836) we live in freedom and peace right kind  
[0:30:38](https://youtu.be/rPvWFCdEOLU?t=1838) of thing so every time you know the  
[0:30:41](https://youtu.be/rPvWFCdEOLU?t=1841) Christian tradition or the Church of the  
[0:30:43](https://youtu.be/rPvWFCdEOLU?t=1843) Holy Spirit has been manifesting itself  
[0:30:45](https://youtu.be/rPvWFCdEOLU?t=1845) politically right throughout the ages it  
[0:30:47](https://youtu.be/rPvWFCdEOLU?t=1847) has been bloodshed and killing of  
[0:30:49](https://youtu.be/rPvWFCdEOLU?t=1849) minorities and stuff what's going on  
[0:30:50](https://youtu.be/rPvWFCdEOLU?t=1850) here and it's interesting that a famous  
[0:30:52](https://youtu.be/rPvWFCdEOLU?t=1852) Jewish aide sage and poet Abraham even  
[0:30:56](https://youtu.be/rPvWFCdEOLU?t=1856) Ezra he wrote the following when he was  
[0:30:57](https://youtu.be/rPvWFCdEOLU?t=1857) living I believe under the Islamic  
[0:31:00](https://youtu.be/rPvWFCdEOLU?t=1860) influence Islamic Authority he said the  
[0:31:03](https://youtu.be/rPvWFCdEOLU?t=1863) Muslims sing of love and passion the  
[0:31:07](https://youtu.be/rPvWFCdEOLU?t=1867) Christians  
[0:31:08](https://youtu.be/rPvWFCdEOLU?t=1868) of war and revenge the Greeks of wisdom  
[0:31:12](https://youtu.be/rPvWFCdEOLU?t=1872) and devices the Indians of parables and  
[0:31:15](https://youtu.be/rPvWFCdEOLU?t=1875) riddles and Israelites songs and praises  
[0:31:17](https://youtu.be/rPvWFCdEOLU?t=1877) to the lord of the hosts so you know  
[0:31:19](https://youtu.be/rPvWFCdEOLU?t=1879) poetry is like a mirror what's happening  
[0:31:22](https://youtu.be/rPvWFCdEOLU?t=1882) from a historical perspective and the  
[0:31:24](https://youtu.be/rPvWFCdEOLU?t=1884) other thing I want to say is we had our  
[0:31:26](https://youtu.be/rPvWFCdEOLU?t=1886) kind of saintly figures our pious  
[0:31:28](https://youtu.be/rPvWFCdEOLU?t=1888) predecessors our pious masters  
[0:31:30](https://youtu.be/rPvWFCdEOLU?t=1890) especially in the early three  
[0:31:32](https://youtu.be/rPvWFCdEOLU?t=1892) generations the love of God loving God  
[0:31:35](https://youtu.be/rPvWFCdEOLU?t=1895) was an act of worship  
[0:31:36](https://youtu.be/rPvWFCdEOLU?t=1896) right because worshiping Allah means  
[0:31:38](https://youtu.be/rPvWFCdEOLU?t=1898) what to know him to love him to obey Him  
[0:31:40](https://youtu.be/rPvWFCdEOLU?t=1900) and to direct and single out all acts of  
[0:31:42](https://youtu.be/rPvWFCdEOLU?t=1902) worship to God alone and there was a  
[0:31:44](https://youtu.be/rPvWFCdEOLU?t=1904) famous scholar if you like yeah it was a  
[0:31:48](https://youtu.be/rPvWFCdEOLU?t=1908) woman shahe her name is a Rabia  
[0:31:51](https://youtu.be/rPvWFCdEOLU?t=1911) al-adawiya she wrote a beautiful poem  
[0:31:54](https://youtu.be/rPvWFCdEOLU?t=1914) and she wrote about the love of allah is  
[0:31:57](https://youtu.be/rPvWFCdEOLU?t=1917) very moving she said two ways I love the  
[0:32:02](https://youtu.be/rPvWFCdEOLU?t=1922) selfishly  
[0:32:03](https://youtu.be/rPvWFCdEOLU?t=1923) and next as worthy is of thee two  
[0:32:08](https://youtu.be/rPvWFCdEOLU?t=1928) selfish love that I do not say think on  
[0:32:11](https://youtu.be/rPvWFCdEOLU?t=1931) thee with every thought tis purest love  
[0:32:14](https://youtu.be/rPvWFCdEOLU?t=1934) when thou dost raise two veil to my  
[0:32:18](https://youtu.be/rPvWFCdEOLU?t=1938) adoring gaze not mine the praise in that  
[0:32:21](https://youtu.be/rPvWFCdEOLU?t=1941) or this line is the praise in both I  
[0:32:25](https://youtu.be/rPvWFCdEOLU?t=1945) wish yeah it's a really powerful it's  
[0:32:30](https://youtu.be/rPvWFCdEOLU?t=1950) through our tradition we've had  
[0:32:31](https://youtu.be/rPvWFCdEOLU?t=1951) scholarly people pious people especially  
[0:32:34](https://youtu.be/rPvWFCdEOLU?t=1954) the early three generations talking  
[0:32:36](https://youtu.be/rPvWFCdEOLU?t=1956) about the love of the Divine talking  
[0:32:38](https://youtu.be/rPvWFCdEOLU?t=1958) about one of these amazing things so  
[0:32:40](https://youtu.be/rPvWFCdEOLU?t=1960) it's very important to understand that  
[0:32:42](https://youtu.be/rPvWFCdEOLU?t=1962) the idea of God's love and us loving God  
[0:32:45](https://youtu.be/rPvWFCdEOLU?t=1965) has manifested itself throughout history  
[0:32:48](https://youtu.be/rPvWFCdEOLU?t=1968) through our poetry through our  
[0:32:50](https://youtu.be/rPvWFCdEOLU?t=1970) literature I mentioned alaa ghazzal II  
[0:32:51](https://youtu.be/rPvWFCdEOLU?t=1971) when he talks about divine love  
[0:32:52](https://youtu.be/rPvWFCdEOLU?t=1972) what about the student of e-beam Tamiya  
[0:32:54](https://youtu.be/rPvWFCdEOLU?t=1974) even poem when he basically wrote you  
[0:32:57](https://youtu.be/rPvWFCdEOLU?t=1977) know he's caught the heart surgeon and  
[0:32:59](https://youtu.be/rPvWFCdEOLU?t=1979) I'm not talk about medical or we're  
[0:33:00](https://youtu.be/rPvWFCdEOLU?t=1980) talking about spiritual ha he talks  
[0:33:02](https://youtu.be/rPvWFCdEOLU?t=1982) about the love of Allah right and being  
[0:33:05](https://youtu.be/rPvWFCdEOLU?t=1985) close to Allah and loving him you know  
[0:33:07](https://youtu.be/rPvWFCdEOLU?t=1987) it is an aspect of the key aspect of  
[0:33:10](https://youtu.be/rPvWFCdEOLU?t=1990) worship to have a class which means  
[0:33:11](https://youtu.be/rPvWFCdEOLU?t=1991) sincerity to do the act of worship for  
[0:33:14](https://youtu.be/rPvWFCdEOLU?t=1994) Allah alone and one aspect of the class  
[0:33:16](https://youtu.be/rPvWFCdEOLU?t=1996) is do to do because he's worthy of it to  
[0:33:18](https://youtu.be/rPvWFCdEOLU?t=1998) do it because you love with him right so  
[0:33:21](https://youtu.be/rPvWFCdEOLU?t=2001) it permeates our tradition tradition so  
[0:33:24](https://youtu.be/rPvWFCdEOLU?t=2004) yeah it's unfortunate that you know  
[0:33:26](https://youtu.be/rPvWFCdEOLU?t=2006) people as popular you know they should  
[0:33:28](https://youtu.be/rPvWFCdEOLU?t=2008) have an epistemic duty yes an  
[0:33:31](https://youtu.be/rPvWFCdEOLU?t=2011) intellectual UT to at least allow the  
[0:33:33](https://youtu.be/rPvWFCdEOLU?t=2013) tradition to speak for itself from yeah  
[0:33:35](https://youtu.be/rPvWFCdEOLU?t=2015) and broad honesty like when you think  
[0:33:37](https://youtu.be/rPvWFCdEOLU?t=2017) about just the mercy of Allah even to  
[0:33:40](https://youtu.be/rPvWFCdEOLU?t=2020) the sinner the one that stunned all this  
[0:33:42](https://youtu.be/rPvWFCdEOLU?t=2022) evil and wrong bro  
[0:33:43](https://youtu.be/rPvWFCdEOLU?t=2023) Allah is loving mercy encompasses them  
[0:33:45](https://youtu.be/rPvWFCdEOLU?t=2025) Allah reminds them Allah calls them back  
[0:33:47](https://youtu.be/rPvWFCdEOLU?t=2027) online encourages them by telling them  
[0:33:49](https://youtu.be/rPvWFCdEOLU?t=2029) that he does not love them you know a  
[0:33:51](https://youtu.be/rPvWFCdEOLU?t=2031) lie encourages them by telling them who  
[0:33:53](https://youtu.be/rPvWFCdEOLU?t=2033) he does love Allah gives them time on  
[0:33:55](https://youtu.be/rPvWFCdEOLU?t=2035) this earth bro  
[0:33:56](https://youtu.be/rPvWFCdEOLU?t=2036) he doesn't just kill them or take their  
[0:33:57](https://youtu.be/rPvWFCdEOLU?t=2037) life immediately as soon as they commit  
[0:33:59](https://youtu.be/rPvWFCdEOLU?t=2039) a sin or do something even interestingly  
[0:34:00](https://youtu.be/rPvWFCdEOLU?t=2040) that is a manifestation of intense mercy  
[0:34:02](https://youtu.be/rPvWFCdEOLU?t=2042) yeah and as I said mercy is a cinnamon  
[0:34:05](https://youtu.be/rPvWFCdEOLU?t=2045) for love in the English language so  
[0:34:06](https://youtu.be/rPvWFCdEOLU?t=2046) Allah has a tense mercy for you and that  
[0:34:08](https://youtu.be/rPvWFCdEOLU?t=2048) he would say to you your state of being  
[0:34:10](https://youtu.be/rPvWFCdEOLU?t=2050) how he relates yourself others and how  
[0:34:12](https://youtu.be/rPvWFCdEOLU?t=2052) you relate to God is something that he  
[0:34:14](https://youtu.be/rPvWFCdEOLU?t=2054) does not love Allah so what would make  
[0:34:17](https://youtu.be/rPvWFCdEOLU?t=2057) you think I need to stay change my state  
[0:34:19](https://youtu.be/rPvWFCdEOLU?t=2059) of being yes  
[0:34:20](https://youtu.be/rPvWFCdEOLU?t=2060) mr. lambreaux and and all of this look  
[0:34:23](https://youtu.be/rPvWFCdEOLU?t=2063) how beautifully it's in line with the  
[0:34:25](https://youtu.be/rPvWFCdEOLU?t=2065) objective of this existence as well that  
[0:34:28](https://youtu.be/rPvWFCdEOLU?t=2068) Allah is not creating a situation now by  
[0:34:30](https://youtu.be/rPvWFCdEOLU?t=2070) some sort of sacrifice which which  
[0:34:32](https://youtu.be/rPvWFCdEOLU?t=2072) brings into question his justice you  
[0:34:34](https://youtu.be/rPvWFCdEOLU?t=2074) know brings it to question here is there  
[0:34:35](https://youtu.be/rPvWFCdEOLU?t=2075) is forgiveness  
[0:34:36](https://youtu.be/rPvWFCdEOLU?t=2076) it all just pans out in such a beautiful  
[0:34:38](https://youtu.be/rPvWFCdEOLU?t=2078) and coherent way span Allah you know  
[0:34:40](https://youtu.be/rPvWFCdEOLU?t=2080) just thinking absolutely let's let's  
[0:34:43](https://youtu.be/rPvWFCdEOLU?t=2083) finish let's finish off if he's not  
[0:34:45](https://youtu.be/rPvWFCdEOLU?t=2085) finished already  
[0:34:46](https://youtu.be/rPvWFCdEOLU?t=2086) he's pretty pretty much finished but  
[0:34:48](https://youtu.be/rPvWFCdEOLU?t=2088) let's finish off for he was less what  
[0:34:50](https://youtu.be/rPvWFCdEOLU?t=2090) you saying so I would agree with those  
[0:35:39](https://youtu.be/rPvWFCdEOLU?t=2139) okay so yep yeah well we've already  
[0:35:46](https://youtu.be/rPvWFCdEOLU?t=2146) dealt with those points just to go back  
[0:35:48](https://youtu.be/rPvWFCdEOLU?t=2148) on the point he says the God of Islam  
[0:35:49](https://youtu.be/rPvWFCdEOLU?t=2149) his love is partial selective and earned  
[0:35:52](https://youtu.be/rPvWFCdEOLU?t=2152) again that's not true  
[0:35:54](https://youtu.be/rPvWFCdEOLU?t=2154) God's intense mercy and remember mercy  
[0:35:56](https://youtu.be/rPvWFCdEOLU?t=2156) the cinnamon of love in the English  
[0:35:58](https://youtu.be/rPvWFCdEOLU?t=2158) language God's mercy is impartial is for  
[0:36:02](https://youtu.be/rPvWFCdEOLU?t=2162) everybody sinner and unbeliever dispiay  
[0:36:05](https://youtu.be/rPvWFCdEOLU?t=2165) good doer etc it's not select Clara  
[0:36:08](https://youtu.be/rPvWFCdEOLU?t=2168) Hamza can you just repeat what Craig  
[0:36:09](https://youtu.be/rPvWFCdEOLU?t=2169) said because I don't think the guys  
[0:36:11](https://youtu.be/rPvWFCdEOLU?t=2171) could hear the loss yes so basically  
[0:36:12](https://youtu.be/rPvWFCdEOLU?t=2172) what he said he said the God in Islam  
[0:36:14](https://youtu.be/rPvWFCdEOLU?t=2174) his love is partial selective and has to  
[0:36:17](https://youtu.be/rPvWFCdEOLU?t=2177) be earned  
[0:36:18](https://youtu.be/rPvWFCdEOLU?t=2178) and then I'm saying we already dealt  
[0:36:20](https://youtu.be/rPvWFCdEOLU?t=2180) with that because mercy Allah being a  
[0:36:23](https://youtu.be/rPvWFCdEOLU?t=2183) rahman intensely merciful mercy is a  
[0:36:26](https://youtu.be/rPvWFCdEOLU?t=2186) synonym for love and Allah says that his  
[0:36:28](https://youtu.be/rPvWFCdEOLU?t=2188) mercy encompasses everything so it's not  
[0:36:30](https://youtu.be/rPvWFCdEOLU?t=2190) partial it's not selective is for  
[0:36:32](https://youtu.be/rPvWFCdEOLU?t=2192) everyone and everything good person bad  
[0:36:34](https://youtu.be/rPvWFCdEOLU?t=2194) person believer deceiver and it's not  
[0:36:36](https://youtu.be/rPvWFCdEOLU?t=2196) earned because you could reject him you  
[0:36:39](https://youtu.be/rPvWFCdEOLU?t=2199) could live a life of disobeying him and  
[0:36:41](https://youtu.be/rPvWFCdEOLU?t=2201) a lie store and developing you in his  
[0:36:43](https://youtu.be/rPvWFCdEOLU?t=2203) intense powerful immediate mercy because  
[0:36:47](https://youtu.be/rPvWFCdEOLU?t=2207) that's what a right man means and  
[0:36:49](https://youtu.be/rPvWFCdEOLU?t=2209) interestingly the word ar-rahman shares  
[0:36:51](https://youtu.be/rPvWFCdEOLU?t=2211) the same root as the root for the womb  
[0:36:54](https://youtu.be/rPvWFCdEOLU?t=2214) right and you know the womb holds the  
[0:36:57](https://youtu.be/rPvWFCdEOLU?t=2217) baby and the mother  
[0:36:58](https://youtu.be/rPvWFCdEOLU?t=2218) what kind of love does she have for the  
[0:37:00](https://youtu.be/rPvWFCdEOLU?t=2220) baby and this echoes a prophetic  
[0:37:02](https://youtu.be/rPvWFCdEOLU?t=2222) tradition with the Prophet Muhammad upon  
[0:37:04](https://youtu.be/rPvWFCdEOLU?t=2224) whom be peace said that you know Allah  
[0:37:08](https://youtu.be/rPvWFCdEOLU?t=2228) has more affection for you than your  
[0:37:10](https://youtu.be/rPvWFCdEOLU?t=2230) mother's Hamas case closed I don't know  
[0:37:13](https://youtu.be/rPvWFCdEOLU?t=2233) what Craig is really is Craig reading  
[0:37:16](https://youtu.be/rPvWFCdEOLU?t=2236) the same tradition is he reading the  
[0:37:18](https://youtu.be/rPvWFCdEOLU?t=2238) same Quran is he reading the same  
[0:37:20](https://youtu.be/rPvWFCdEOLU?t=2240) intellectual spiritual tradition has he  
[0:37:23](https://youtu.be/rPvWFCdEOLU?t=2243) studied the Islamic theology properly so  
[0:37:25](https://youtu.be/rPvWFCdEOLU?t=2245) why when I say to him is this why don't  
[0:37:28](https://youtu.be/rPvWFCdEOLU?t=2248) you accept this woman to the invitation  
[0:37:31](https://youtu.be/rPvWFCdEOLU?t=2251) it's gonna be warm it's gonna be a  
[0:37:33](https://youtu.be/rPvWFCdEOLU?t=2253) dialogue it's not going to be hopefully  
[0:37:35](https://youtu.be/rPvWFCdEOLU?t=2255) arrogant and excessive is gonna be just  
[0:37:37](https://youtu.be/rPvWFCdEOLU?t=2257) two people speaking or as many people as  
[0:37:40](https://youtu.be/rPvWFCdEOLU?t=2260) you want come online for a live  
[0:37:43](https://youtu.be/rPvWFCdEOLU?t=2263) discussion with sapience Institute let's  
[0:37:46](https://youtu.be/rPvWFCdEOLU?t=2266) have a discussion on the  
[0:37:48](https://youtu.be/rPvWFCdEOLU?t=2268) of God in Islam and the concept of God  
[0:37:50](https://youtu.be/rPvWFCdEOLU?t=2270) in the Islamic in the Christian  
[0:37:53](https://youtu.be/rPvWFCdEOLU?t=2273) tradition it's time that we had a  
[0:37:55](https://youtu.be/rPvWFCdEOLU?t=2275) conversation about this it's time that  
[0:37:57](https://youtu.be/rPvWFCdEOLU?t=2277) we don't talk past each other it is time  
[0:37:59](https://youtu.be/rPvWFCdEOLU?t=2279) that we articulate our case for the  
[0:38:02](https://youtu.be/rPvWFCdEOLU?t=2282) concept of of God in our traditions in a  
[0:38:05](https://youtu.be/rPvWFCdEOLU?t=2285) warm intellectual and in in in in a  
[0:38:08](https://youtu.be/rPvWFCdEOLU?t=2288) compassionate way with wisdom and you  
[0:38:11](https://youtu.be/rPvWFCdEOLU?t=2291) know without talking over each other  
[0:38:12](https://youtu.be/rPvWFCdEOLU?t=2292) having a nice friendly discussion just  
[0:38:15](https://youtu.be/rPvWFCdEOLU?t=2295) like what you had with you know a  
[0:38:17](https://youtu.be/rPvWFCdEOLU?t=2297) popular YouTube atheist cosmic skeptic  
[0:38:20](https://youtu.be/rPvWFCdEOLU?t=2300) I'm sure you could do that with someone  
[0:38:21](https://youtu.be/rPvWFCdEOLU?t=2301) who you know is of the Abrahamic faiths  
[0:38:25](https://youtu.be/rPvWFCdEOLU?t=2305) let's have that discussion it's time  
[0:38:27](https://youtu.be/rPvWFCdEOLU?t=2307) that we had discussion on this  
[0:38:28](https://youtu.be/rPvWFCdEOLU?t=2308) particular point and to do it in a way  
[0:38:30](https://youtu.be/rPvWFCdEOLU?t=2310) that is edifying because maybe we've  
[0:38:33](https://youtu.be/rPvWFCdEOLU?t=2313) said something a little bit wrong today  
[0:38:34](https://youtu.be/rPvWFCdEOLU?t=2314) maybe we've misrepresented the Christian  
[0:38:36](https://youtu.be/rPvWFCdEOLU?t=2316) tradition maybe whatever the case may be  
[0:38:38](https://youtu.be/rPvWFCdEOLU?t=2318) we can actually learn from each other  
[0:38:40](https://youtu.be/rPvWFCdEOLU?t=2320) from that point of view which is very  
[0:38:42](https://youtu.be/rPvWFCdEOLU?t=2322) powerful very interesting  
[0:38:43](https://youtu.be/rPvWFCdEOLU?t=2323) notwithstanding there is another  
[0:38:45](https://youtu.be/rPvWFCdEOLU?t=2325) approach to dealing with this issue  
[0:38:47](https://youtu.be/rPvWFCdEOLU?t=2327) which brother Adnan Rashid if you go to  
[0:38:49](https://youtu.be/rPvWFCdEOLU?t=2329) brother Adnan Rasheed's YouTube channel  
[0:38:51](https://youtu.be/rPvWFCdEOLU?t=2331) he's actually dealt with this in a  
[0:38:53](https://youtu.be/rPvWFCdEOLU?t=2333) different way it was more of a you know  
[0:38:55](https://youtu.be/rPvWFCdEOLU?t=2335) well let's see if God is loving because  
[0:38:57](https://youtu.be/rPvWFCdEOLU?t=2337) look at the biblical tradition he says  
[0:38:59](https://youtu.be/rPvWFCdEOLU?t=2339) about killing the unbelievers and all of  
[0:39:01](https://youtu.be/rPvWFCdEOLU?t=2341) these things right and he uses that he's  
[0:39:04](https://youtu.be/rPvWFCdEOLU?t=2344) an he uses a texture approach so if so  
[0:39:07](https://youtu.be/rPvWFCdEOLU?t=2347) is interesting in that approach please  
[0:39:08](https://youtu.be/rPvWFCdEOLU?t=2348) go to our dawn which is YouTube channel  
[0:39:10](https://youtu.be/rPvWFCdEOLU?t=2350) for you to learn from that approach as  
[0:39:13](https://youtu.be/rPvWFCdEOLU?t=2353) well that's probably not the particular  
[0:39:15](https://youtu.be/rPvWFCdEOLU?t=2355) approach that I'm used to because that's  
[0:39:17](https://youtu.be/rPvWFCdEOLU?t=2357) not my learning I learned an expert on

[0:40:46](https://youtu.be/rPvWFCdEOLU?t=2446) one number one first and foremost to  
[0:40:48](https://youtu.be/rPvWFCdEOLU?t=2448) clarify you know how we understand and  
[0:40:51](https://youtu.be/rPvWFCdEOLU?t=2451) try to the best of our ability do  
[0:40:53](https://youtu.be/rPvWFCdEOLU?t=2453) justice to how we understand the love of  
[0:40:55](https://youtu.be/rPvWFCdEOLU?t=2455) Allah from the Islamic tradition and  
[0:40:56](https://youtu.be/rPvWFCdEOLU?t=2456) secondly was to invite dr. William Lane  
[0:40:58](https://youtu.be/rPvWFCdEOLU?t=2458) Craig for an official debate it could be  
[0:41:00](https://youtu.be/rPvWFCdEOLU?t=2460) online we know he's done it before with  
[0:41:02](https://youtu.be/rPvWFCdEOLU?t=2462) the cosmic skeptic etc online so there  
[0:41:04](https://youtu.be/rPvWFCdEOLU?t=2464) shouldn't be any excuses or issues so  
[0:41:07](https://youtu.be/rPvWFCdEOLU?t=2467) definitely you know and another thing  
[0:41:08](https://youtu.be/rPvWFCdEOLU?t=2468) brothers and sisters is humza there's

[0:41:13](https://youtu.be/rPvWFCdEOLU?t=2473) people watching this live is about three  
[0:41:14](https://youtu.be/rPvWFCdEOLU?t=2474) hundred and six now the brothers and  
[0:41:16](https://youtu.be/rPvWFCdEOLU?t=2476) sisters all night it's it's I would say  
[0:41:17](https://youtu.be/rPvWFCdEOLU?t=2477) it's a responsibility upon every single  
[0:41:19](https://youtu.be/rPvWFCdEOLU?t=2479) one of us right now to share this or  
[0:41:21](https://youtu.be/rPvWFCdEOLU?t=2481) tweet this to dr. William Lane Craig or  
[0:41:24](https://youtu.be/rPvWFCdEOLU?t=2484) his team and and get this out there so  
[0:41:26](https://youtu.be/rPvWFCdEOLU?t=2486) we can have that dialogue let's make  
[0:41:28](https://youtu.be/rPvWFCdEOLU?t=2488) this content and at the very least bro  
[0:41:31](https://youtu.be/rPvWFCdEOLU?t=2491) at least he gets to learn about what  
[0:41:32](https://youtu.be/rPvWFCdEOLU?t=2492) Islam says in regards to the love of God  
[0:41:33](https://youtu.be/rPvWFCdEOLU?t=2493) yes now one thing one thing I want to  
[0:41:35](https://youtu.be/rPvWFCdEOLU?t=2495) mention is to the Muslims right you know  
[0:41:38](https://youtu.be/rPvWFCdEOLU?t=2498) we have to take responsibility as well  
[0:41:40](https://youtu.be/rPvWFCdEOLU?t=2500) we haven't you know collectively  
[0:41:44](https://youtu.be/rPvWFCdEOLU?t=2504) especially in the West revived this  
[0:41:46](https://youtu.be/rPvWFCdEOLU?t=2506) understanding of worship that includes  
[0:41:48](https://youtu.be/rPvWFCdEOLU?t=2508) God's love it's very important for us to  
[0:41:52](https://youtu.be/rPvWFCdEOLU?t=2512) resurrect this classical mainstream  
[0:41:55](https://youtu.be/rPvWFCdEOLU?t=2515) Islamic understanding of the divine  
[0:41:57](https://youtu.be/rPvWFCdEOLU?t=2517) nature that his illudude he is the  
[0:41:59](https://youtu.be/rPvWFCdEOLU?t=2519) loving and how we relate to that because  
[0:42:01](https://youtu.be/rPvWFCdEOLU?t=2521) what in worshiping Allah Intel's knowing  
[0:42:04](https://youtu.be/rPvWFCdEOLU?t=2524) him but also loving him and obeying him  
[0:42:06](https://youtu.be/rPvWFCdEOLU?t=2526) and that includes being humbled before  
[0:42:08](https://youtu.be/rPvWFCdEOLU?t=2528) him and directing all acts of worship to  
[0:42:10](https://youtu.be/rPvWFCdEOLU?t=2530) him alone we need to start  
[0:42:12](https://youtu.be/rPvWFCdEOLU?t=2532) a loving relationship with Allah subhana  
[0:42:14](https://youtu.be/rPvWFCdEOLU?t=2534) WA Ta'ala the reason I'm saying that  
[0:42:16](https://youtu.be/rPvWFCdEOLU?t=2536) because it would change the way we  
[0:42:19](https://youtu.be/rPvWFCdEOLU?t=2539) become in the world and who we are so  
[0:42:21](https://youtu.be/rPvWFCdEOLU?t=2541) I've been so shocked especially when I  
[0:42:24](https://youtu.be/rPvWFCdEOLU?t=2544) became Muslim around 18 years ago that  
[0:42:26](https://youtu.be/rPvWFCdEOLU?t=2546) Christians can say that they have a  
[0:42:28](https://youtu.be/rPvWFCdEOLU?t=2548) loving relationship with the Lord  
[0:42:29](https://youtu.be/rPvWFCdEOLU?t=2549) Muslims don't have a loving relationship  
[0:42:31](https://youtu.be/rPvWFCdEOLU?t=2551) with law and I'm thinking how on earth  
[0:42:33](https://youtu.be/rPvWFCdEOLU?t=2553) can they even say this and ask because  
[0:42:36](https://youtu.be/rPvWFCdEOLU?t=2556) maybe we don't speak about this enough  
[0:42:38](https://youtu.be/rPvWFCdEOLU?t=2558) because if any Christian I'm talking to  
[0:42:41](https://youtu.be/rPvWFCdEOLU?t=2561) my Christian brothers and sisters in  
[0:42:42](https://youtu.be/rPvWFCdEOLU?t=2562) humanity now if you understood who Allah  
[0:42:45](https://youtu.be/rPvWFCdEOLU?t=2565) is that he doesn't require anything  
[0:42:47](https://youtu.be/rPvWFCdEOLU?t=2567) external to the way you relate to God in  
[0:42:49](https://youtu.be/rPvWFCdEOLU?t=2569) order to God for God to forgive you  
[0:42:51](https://youtu.be/rPvWFCdEOLU?t=2571) right you know it doesn't require an  
[0:42:53](https://youtu.be/rPvWFCdEOLU?t=2573) external sacrifice doesn't require you  
[0:42:55](https://youtu.be/rPvWFCdEOLU?t=2575) to believe that that sacrifice actually  
[0:42:57](https://youtu.be/rPvWFCdEOLU?t=2577) even happened just your heart to turn to  
[0:42:59](https://youtu.be/rPvWFCdEOLU?t=2579) Him that's all that's required this is  
[0:43:01](https://youtu.be/rPvWFCdEOLU?t=2581) maximal forgiveness this is maximal love  
[0:43:03](https://youtu.be/rPvWFCdEOLU?t=2583) the way you worship Allah is not through  
[0:43:06](https://youtu.be/rPvWFCdEOLU?t=2586) his son or through a pope or a book is a  
[0:43:11](https://youtu.be/rPvWFCdEOLU?t=2591) sheep yourself Salah the five daily  
[0:43:14](https://youtu.be/rPvWFCdEOLU?t=2594) prayers comes from the root word to  
[0:43:16](https://youtu.be/rPvWFCdEOLU?t=2596) connect we want to connect directly to  
[0:43:19](https://youtu.be/rPvWFCdEOLU?t=2599) the divine this is the direct loving  
[0:43:21](https://youtu.be/rPvWFCdEOLU?t=2601) relationship a direct loving  
[0:43:23](https://youtu.be/rPvWFCdEOLU?t=2603) relationship Jesus is not the bridge  
[0:43:26](https://youtu.be/rPvWFCdEOLU?t=2606) between you and the Father  
[0:43:28](https://youtu.be/rPvWFCdEOLU?t=2608) CSO Godfather but rod East is your heart

[0:43:38](https://youtu.be/rPvWFCdEOLU?t=2618) it become closer to allah by following  
[0:43:41](https://youtu.be/rPvWFCdEOLU?t=2621) the prophet muhammad sallallahu id he  
[0:43:43](https://youtu.be/rPvWFCdEOLU?t=2623) wasn't because Allah says in the Quran  
[0:43:44](https://youtu.be/rPvWFCdEOLU?t=2624) if you love Allah then follow me  
[0:43:47](https://youtu.be/rPvWFCdEOLU?t=2627) meaningful o Muhammad SAW solemn and  
[0:43:49](https://youtu.be/rPvWFCdEOLU?t=2629) Allah will love you and forgive your  
[0:43:51](https://youtu.be/rPvWFCdEOLU?t=2631) sins and this is a special type of love  
[0:43:52](https://youtu.be/rPvWFCdEOLU?t=2632) Allah has an intense mercy for you if  
[0:43:54](https://youtu.be/rPvWFCdEOLU?t=2634) you want that special type of love you  
[0:43:56](https://youtu.be/rPvWFCdEOLU?t=2636) want that love then you need to follow  
[0:44:00](https://youtu.be/rPvWFCdEOLU?t=2640) the way to him which is worshipping  
[0:44:02](https://youtu.be/rPvWFCdEOLU?t=2642) Allah subhana WA Ta'ala because because  
[0:44:07](https://youtu.be/rPvWFCdEOLU?t=2647) you know worshipping Allah subhana WA  
[0:44:09](https://youtu.be/rPvWFCdEOLU?t=2649) Ta'ala in the kind of [ __ ] way in  
[0:44:12](https://youtu.be/rPvWFCdEOLU?t=2652) the way of the sunnah of the process  
[0:44:14](https://youtu.be/rPvWFCdEOLU?t=2654) Salam is the way to connect to him and  
[0:44:16](https://youtu.be/rPvWFCdEOLU?t=2656) that doesn't require anything external  
[0:44:18](https://youtu.be/rPvWFCdEOLU?t=2658) doesn't require his son it is you  
[0:44:20](https://youtu.be/rPvWFCdEOLU?t=2660) directly to Allah so ways who has more  
[0:44:23](https://youtu.be/rPvWFCdEOLU?t=2663) of a loving relationship right from that  
[0:44:25](https://youtu.be/rPvWFCdEOLU?t=2665) point of view because it's  
[0:44:26](https://youtu.be/rPvWFCdEOLU?t=2666) it's it's all there it's you your heart  
[0:44:28](https://youtu.be/rPvWFCdEOLU?t=2668) and Allah so you know I want Christians  
[0:44:31](https://youtu.be/rPvWFCdEOLU?t=2671) to study this tradition to understand  
[0:44:34](https://youtu.be/rPvWFCdEOLU?t=2674) this tradition to understand who are  
[0:44:35](https://youtu.be/rPvWFCdEOLU?t=2675) lost Hanna what Allah is and maybe you  
[0:44:38](https://youtu.be/rPvWFCdEOLU?t=2678) should play a final video because it's  
[0:44:40](https://youtu.be/rPvWFCdEOLU?t=2680) very interesting that William Lane Craig  
[0:44:41](https://youtu.be/rPvWFCdEOLU?t=2681) was saying that God in the Quran hates  
[0:44:44](https://youtu.be/rPvWFCdEOLU?t=2684) so-and-so but what is actually the Bible  
[0:44:46](https://youtu.be/rPvWFCdEOLU?t=2686) say I mean you've become a victim of  
[0:44:48](https://youtu.be/rPvWFCdEOLU?t=2688) your own criticism watch this video guys  
[0:44:50](https://youtu.be/rPvWFCdEOLU?t=2690) and put the volume up yeah give me a  
[0:44:53](https://youtu.be/rPvWFCdEOLU?t=2693) second let me just  
[0:44:55](https://youtu.be/rPvWFCdEOLU?t=2695) well basically yeah carry on until you  
[0:44:58](https://youtu.be/rPvWFCdEOLU?t=2698) get it ready it's in Proverbs that the  
[0:45:00](https://youtu.be/rPvWFCdEOLU?t=2700) that the God of the Bible actually hates  
[0:45:02](https://youtu.be/rPvWFCdEOLU?t=2702) seven people or seven things at least  
[0:45:20](https://youtu.be/rPvWFCdEOLU?t=2720) God hates a liar proverbs chapter 6  
[0:45:25](https://youtu.be/rPvWFCdEOLU?t=2725) verse 16 says these six things doth the  
[0:45:29](https://youtu.be/rPvWFCdEOLU?t=2729) Lord hate yay seven are an abomination  
[0:45:33](https://youtu.be/rPvWFCdEOLU?t=2733) unto Him a problem a lying tongue and  
[0:45:38](https://youtu.be/rPvWFCdEOLU?t=2738) hands that shed innocent blood a heart  
[0:45:41](https://youtu.be/rPvWFCdEOLU?t=2741) that devises wicked imaginations feet  
[0:45:44](https://youtu.be/rPvWFCdEOLU?t=2744) that be swift and running to mischief a  
[0:45:47](https://youtu.be/rPvWFCdEOLU?t=2747) false witness that speaketh lies and he  
[0:45:50](https://youtu.be/rPvWFCdEOLU?t=2750) that soweth discord among brethren in  
[0:45:55](https://youtu.be/rPvWFCdEOLU?t=2755) the short list of seven things that God  
[0:45:58](https://youtu.be/rPvWFCdEOLU?t=2758) hates to amongst them are lying hey  
[0:46:02](https://youtu.be/rPvWFCdEOLU?t=2762) that's that that pretty much summarizes  
[0:46:03](https://youtu.be/rPvWFCdEOLU?t=2763) it bro I think that's another  
[0:46:05](https://youtu.be/rPvWFCdEOLU?t=2765) interesting points Marla you know a good  
[0:46:07](https://youtu.be/rPvWFCdEOLU?t=2767) we left at the end because it wasn't  
[0:46:08](https://youtu.be/rPvWFCdEOLU?t=2768) necessary broad who think about it you  
[0:46:10](https://youtu.be/rPvWFCdEOLU?t=2770) know make it yeah it wasn't but you know  
[0:46:13](https://youtu.be/rPvWFCdEOLU?t=2773) you have sometimes you need to be  
[0:46:15](https://youtu.be/rPvWFCdEOLU?t=2775) coherent and consistent you can't be a  
[0:46:16](https://youtu.be/rPvWFCdEOLU?t=2776) victim of your own criticism so by the  
[0:46:19](https://youtu.be/rPvWFCdEOLU?t=2779) same criticism to the biblical God my  
[0:46:21](https://youtu.be/rPvWFCdEOLU?t=2781) friend right hates God hates someone  
[0:46:24](https://youtu.be/rPvWFCdEOLU?t=2784) whose God hates talaiya  
[0:46:26](https://youtu.be/rPvWFCdEOLU?t=2786) right hate the liar bro the person who  
[0:46:29](https://youtu.be/rPvWFCdEOLU?t=2789) does false witness or something  
[0:46:31](https://youtu.be/rPvWFCdEOLU?t=2791) so you square the circle dr. William  
[0:46:35](https://youtu.be/rPvWFCdEOLU?t=2795) Lane Craig please Craig needs to be  
[0:46:37](https://youtu.be/rPvWFCdEOLU?t=2797) careful you're gonna say if I'm gonna  
[0:46:39](https://youtu.be/rPvWFCdEOLU?t=2799) say you know  
[0:46:40](https://youtu.be/rPvWFCdEOLU?t=2800) very careful that you're not lying  
[0:46:41](https://youtu.be/rPvWFCdEOLU?t=2801) especially about the Samba tradition  
[0:46:43](https://youtu.be/rPvWFCdEOLU?t=2803) we're not saying he is but he asked at  
[0:46:45](https://youtu.be/rPvWFCdEOLU?t=2805) least to his research when he's speaking  
[0:46:46](https://youtu.be/rPvWFCdEOLU?t=2806) about Islam and the love of God in Islam  
[0:46:48](https://youtu.be/rPvWFCdEOLU?t=2808) that being said brothers and sisters two  
[0:46:50](https://youtu.be/rPvWFCdEOLU?t=2810) things two calls to action number one  
[0:46:52](https://youtu.be/rPvWFCdEOLU?t=2812) share this we William Lane Craig get  
[0:46:54](https://youtu.be/rPvWFCdEOLU?t=2814) this out to him so we can make that  
[0:46:56](https://youtu.be/rPvWFCdEOLU?t=2816) actual debate happen between Hamza and  
[0:46:58](https://youtu.be/rPvWFCdEOLU?t=2818) Craig dr. Craig and secondly pro you'll  
[0:47:01](https://youtu.be/rPvWFCdEOLU?t=2821) be shocked last thing you know when I  
[0:47:03](https://youtu.be/rPvWFCdEOLU?t=2823) was going through doing a bit of  
[0:47:04](https://youtu.be/rPvWFCdEOLU?t=2824) research yesterday in Google so many
