### [00:00:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7gAwa9i-Vrw\&t=0) - [01:00:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7gAwa9i-Vrw\&t=3600)

discusses the arguments for and against the existence of god, the validity of the Quran, and Islam. Mohammed Hijab and Subboor Ahmad argue that knowledge is based on experience, intuition, and reason, and that a thing is defined as something that can conceivably exist. They also discuss the compatibility of atheism and determinism, the role of spirituality in Islam, and the impact of common ancestry on evolutionary theory.

**[00:00:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7gAwa9i-Vrw\&t=0)** The Sapience Institute is hosting a live stream discussing arguments for god's existence, the validity of the Quran, and Islam's truth. Mohammed Hijab and Subboor Ahmad will be discussing the arguments for Islam. Non-Muslims are most welcome to participate in the discussion.

*   **[00:05:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7gAwa9i-Vrw\&t=300)** The Sapience Institute is working to bring together different intellectual property from the Middle East, including books written by a doctor who has translated many into Arabic. Yusuf is a brother of Mohammed Hijab and joins the discussion to answer questions. He points out that a necessary fact cannot explain a contingent fact without introducing a fact in need of explanation, which introduces a new contingent fact in need of explanation. This argument is mischaracterized because it is not about facts and necessary existences, but about the category of existence.
*   **[00:10:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7gAwa9i-Vrw\&t=600)** Mohammed Hijab and Subboor Ahmad discuss the difference between facts and existences, and how a necessary existence cannot explain a contingent existence without introducing a contingent existence in need of explanation. This is a misunderstanding of the argument, as necessary existence is the cumulative result of reasoning from contingency.
*   **[00:15:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7gAwa9i-Vrw\&t=900)** The fallacy of composition says that because something is composed of smaller parts, the whole thing must be smaller. Bertrand Russell argued that, because human beings have a mother and father, humankind has a mother and father. This is contrary to what he said in his discussion with a fellow philosopher called Kostenkopson. Russell was saying that, if we're saying everything that begins to exist has a cause, the universe itself must have a cause. However, because we don't have a full knowledge of the universe, the fallacy of composition only works if we observe the whole.
*   \**[00:20:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7gAwa9i-Vrw\&t=1200)* Discusses the problem of trying to make claims about the universe without first understanding how it works. Mohammed Hijab and Subboor Ahmad discuss how this blind spot can be a problem in making arguments about the universe. The two discuss the use of two different arguments: the argument from causation (which is necessary to undercut the argument from part-to-whole) and the argument from contingency (which is necessary to argue that the universe is generated and/or dependent). The argument from causation relies on the idea that anything which is composed of parts is generated, while the argument from contingency relies on the idea that anything which is composed of parts can be assembled and reassembled. Neither argument provides a full understanding of the whole, and both are susceptible to the fallacy of composition. Therefore, the video concludes that it is important to use both arguments together in order to provide a full understanding of the universe.
*   **[00:25:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7gAwa9i-Vrw\&t=1500)** Mohammed Hijab and Subboor Ahmad discuss the nature of knowledge and logic in a live stream. They argue that one can have an argument with only one premise, and that knowledge is based on experience, intuition, and reason. They also discuss the point of causation, and how it can be argued a priori.
*   **[00:30:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7gAwa9i-Vrw\&t=1800)** Mohammed Hijab and Subboor Ahmad discuss the concept of a logical contradiction. They say that a thing is defined as something that can conceivably exist, so a square triangle can never exist. They argue that if something is a logical contradiction in this world, it will be a logical contradiction everywhere. Compatibilists believe that everything is possible and that knowledge of the mechanism of something is unknown, but they still believe in a continuous causal chain of events that renders everything that happens as necessarily happening.
*   **[00:35:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7gAwa9i-Vrw\&t=2100)** Mohammed Hijab and Subboor Ahmad discuss the implications of free will and determinism and how they can coexist. They also discuss the importance of moral issues, and how they can become irrelevant if determinism is taken to its logical conclusion.
*   **[00:40:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7gAwa9i-Vrw\&t=2400)** Sam Harris is a hypocrite because he challenges religion on moral bases while accepting hard determinism, which means that a human being on determinism is not responsible for their behavior.
*   **[00:45:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7gAwa9i-Vrw\&t=2700)** Mohammed Hijab and Subboor Ahmad discuss the compatibility of atheism and determinism, the role of spirituality in Islam, and the impact of common ancestry on evolutionary theory.
*   \**[00:50:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7gAwa9i-Vrw\&t=3000)* Discusses a controversy about junk DNA, with philosopher Philip Kitcher arguing that most of it is functional. Richard Dawkins and others disagree and claim that it is vestigial, meaning it is no longer useful. Jonathan Sacks, the former rabbi of the Grand Rabbi in the UK, agrees that the majority of it is functional, but cautions that the Darwinian paradigm may not be the best way to view this information.
*   **[00:55:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7gAwa9i-Vrw\&t=3300)** Mohammed Hijab and Subboor Ahmad discuss how natural selection can eliminate jobs that are not useful for the organism, and how this can lead to false positives in scientific research. Hijab challenges the study's definition of functional DNA, and Ahmad explains that the example he gave of a muscle is specific to a particular population, not universal.

### [01:00:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7gAwa9i-Vrw\&t=3600) - [02:00:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7gAwa9i-Vrw\&t=7200)

The Sapience Institute discusses various aspects of Islam and Judaism in a live video. Mohammed Hijab and Subboor Ahmad compare and contrast the two religions, discuss the importance of studying both in order to better understand Islam, and share their thoughts on the recent David Wood vs. Mohammed Hijab debate. They also advise caution when engaging in potentially dangerous practices, such as astral projection.

\**[01:00:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7gAwa9i-Vrw\&t=3600)* Discusses how arguments for Islam can be found in the Quran, and how theology is the strongest proof for Islam. He also suggests that studying the French case regarding islamophobia is important.

*   **[01:05:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7gAwa9i-Vrw\&t=3900)** Mohammed Hijab and Subboor Ahmad discuss the theology of Islam and how it compares to other religions. They discuss how Judaism and Christianity share similar concepts, but Islam is the only true religion. They also explain how Judaism hinders their argument for Islam because it includes elements of Judaism that go against the Quran. Finally, they talk about why it is important to study Judaism and Christianity in order to better understand Islam.
*   **[01:10:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7gAwa9i-Vrw\&t=4200)** The Sapience Institute discusses various aspects of Islam and Judaism, discussing how some of the similarities between the two religions may be deceiving. Mohammed Hijab and Subboor Ahmad provide perspectives on the matter.
*   **[01:15:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7gAwa9i-Vrw\&t=4500)** Mohammed Hijab and Subboor Ahmad discuss the evidence that prophets were expected in the end times, including the Prophet Muhammad. They also discuss Philo's writings, in which he mentions the Prophet Muhammad as a possible deuteronomy 18 prophet. Finally, they mention the Medinan Jew Sophia's dream in which she sees the moon and her father speaking to each other. She eventually decides to follow the Prophet Muhammad and is grateful to him for fulfilling her dream.
*   **[01:20:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7gAwa9i-Vrw\&t=4800)** Mohammed Hijab and Subboor Ahmad discuss judaism and he says that Eugenice's rubber is from 400-500 AD. He also says that jews should be careful when claiming to be experts in their field, as it can backfire. Finally, Hijab gives a piece of advice for young people.
*   **[01:25:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7gAwa9i-Vrw\&t=5100)** In this poem, the narrator talks about how fasting during Ramadan is hard for him, but Allah is still forgiving. He asks the messenger of God to free him from his fast, and the messenger of God responds that it is impossible. The narrator thanks Allah for his mercy, and ends with a request for Allah's guidance.
*   **[01:30:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7gAwa9i-Vrw\&t=5400)** Mohammed Hijab and Subboor Ahmad discuss the importance of poetry and its role in Islam. Hijab shares an example of a hadith in which a man has intercourse with his wife while lucid and aware of his surroundings. Ahmad points out that many people are unaware of astral projection, a possible side-effect of dmt use. Hijab advises caution before engaging in such potentially dangerous practices, as they could lead to harm if not done correctly.
*   **[01:35:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7gAwa9i-Vrw\&t=5700)** Mohammed Hijab and Subboor Ahmad discuss the idea of soul leaving the body and how it relates to the recent David Wood vs. Mohammed Hijab debate. They also discuss how a person's ego can lead to them underestimating their opponents. After the debate, Mohammed Hijab noticed that David Wood had lost confidence and retired.
*   **[01:40:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7gAwa9i-Vrw\&t=6000)** Mohammed Hijab and Subboor Ahmad discuss the potential consequences of multiple deities, and Qazi argues that they would have to be differentiated against each other in order to exist. Danish Khan asks Qazi about the argument in his book Kamal that dependent objects would limit the necessary existence of the independent deity. Qazi responds that this isn't any sort of doubt or hesitation, and offers two questions based on the argument.
*   **[01:45:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7gAwa9i-Vrw\&t=6300)** The Sapience Institute discusses the idea that if all God has is knowledge, then he cannot be the most powerful being because he would have equal knowledge and power to another being with the same abilities. This concept is similar to that of Jesus, who also had equal knowledge and power to other entities. If any Muslims believe that this logic negates their faith, it is important to appreciate the difference between the two beliefs.
*   **[01:50:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7gAwa9i-Vrw\&t=6600)** argues that if there are two necessary existences, one with necessary qualities and one without, then it is logically impossible for the two to be different. He goes on to say that if necessary resistance is the same in both existences, then it is equivalent to saying that they are the same. He concludes that if there are no moral restrictions, then it is possible for the two to be different.
*   \**[01:55:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7gAwa9i-Vrw\&t=6900)* Discusses the contradiction between being omnipotent and having mercy. He argues that this contradiction is only relative and can be resolved by understanding that actions are only evil insofar as we choose to interact with the world in a certain way.

### [02:00:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7gAwa9i-Vrw\&t=7200) - [02:05:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7gAwa9i-Vrw\&t=7500)

The Sapience Institute held a live event with Mohammed Hijab and Subboor Ahmad to discuss how Muslims can use technology to improve their lives and the global community. The panelists discussed the importance of maintaining a creative relationship with God, while also recognizing His mercy and wisdom.

**[02:00:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7gAwa9i-Vrw\&t=7200)** The Sapience Institute discusses the difference between evil and relative evil, and how our actions are indirectly creative because of God's creative relationship with us. Mohammed Hijab and Subboor Ahmad share their thoughts on the omnipotence and sovereignty of God. It is important to maintain a creative relationship with God, while also recognizing His mercy and wisdom.

*   **[02:05:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7gAwa9i-Vrw\&t=7500)** The Sapience Institute hosted a live event with Mohammed Hijab, a Muslim scholar, and Subboor Ahmad, a software engineer, to discuss the intersection of Islam and technology.

[0:01:03](https://youtu.be/7gAwa9i-Vrw?t=63) sapience institute\
[0:01:04](https://youtu.be/7gAwa9i-Vrw?t=64) regularly pushes out right i just had to\

[0:01:12](https://youtu.be/7gAwa9i-Vrw?t=72) what we are doing as support kind of\
[0:01:15](https://youtu.be/7gAwa9i-Vrw?t=75) alluded to here at\
[0:01:16](https://youtu.be/7gAwa9i-Vrw?t=76) the sapiens institute is really two\
[0:01:18](https://youtu.be/7gAwa9i-Vrw?t=78) things the objectives are twofold\
[0:01:21](https://youtu.be/7gAwa9i-Vrw?t=81) one is to argue\
[0:01:24](https://youtu.be/7gAwa9i-Vrw?t=84) rationally a case for the truth of islam\
[0:01:27](https://youtu.be/7gAwa9i-Vrw?t=87) why islam is true\
[0:01:29](https://youtu.be/7gAwa9i-Vrw?t=89) and the other one is to handle\
[0:01:31](https://youtu.be/7gAwa9i-Vrw?t=91) objections\
[0:01:32](https://youtu.be/7gAwa9i-Vrw?t=92) of those people who have such objections\
[0:01:35](https://youtu.be/7gAwa9i-Vrw?t=95) or detractors of islam these are just\
[0:01:37](https://youtu.be/7gAwa9i-Vrw?t=97) basically if you want to put it in\
[0:01:39](https://youtu.be/7gAwa9i-Vrw?t=99) a nutshell what we do how we do that\
[0:01:42](https://youtu.be/7gAwa9i-Vrw?t=102) obviously\
[0:01:42](https://youtu.be/7gAwa9i-Vrw?t=102) is through videographic information\
[0:01:44](https://youtu.be/7gAwa9i-Vrw?t=104) through the publication of material\
[0:01:46](https://youtu.be/7gAwa9i-Vrw?t=106) through training courses which is a big\
[0:01:48](https://youtu.be/7gAwa9i-Vrw?t=108) part of what we do\
[0:01:49](https://youtu.be/7gAwa9i-Vrw?t=109) training individuals and so on and so\
[0:01:51](https://youtu.be/7gAwa9i-Vrw?t=111) forth having\
[0:01:52](https://youtu.be/7gAwa9i-Vrw?t=112) live sessions with you guys like this uh\
[0:01:55](https://youtu.be/7gAwa9i-Vrw?t=115) among\
[0:01:56](https://youtu.be/7gAwa9i-Vrw?t=116) myriad of other things we do as well um\
[0:01:59](https://youtu.be/7gAwa9i-Vrw?t=119) research based text based which you will\
[0:02:02](https://youtu.be/7gAwa9i-Vrw?t=122) see hopefully inshallah in the next six\
[0:02:03](https://youtu.be/7gAwa9i-Vrw?t=123) months\
[0:02:05](https://youtu.be/7gAwa9i-Vrw?t=125) what we've been focusing on in terms of\
[0:02:07](https://youtu.be/7gAwa9i-Vrw?t=127) the sapience thoughts project\
[0:02:09](https://youtu.be/7gAwa9i-Vrw?t=129) what i have been focusing on because the\
[0:02:10](https://youtu.be/7gAwa9i-Vrw?t=130) safety and souls project is not just\
[0:02:13](https://youtu.be/7gAwa9i-Vrw?t=133) the material that i'm putting out but\
[0:02:15](https://youtu.be/7gAwa9i-Vrw?t=135) it's going to be\
[0:02:17](https://youtu.be/7gAwa9i-Vrw?t=137) many different speakers talking about\
[0:02:18](https://youtu.be/7gAwa9i-Vrw?t=138) different things but what i personally\
[0:02:20](https://youtu.be/7gAwa9i-Vrw?t=140) the project that i've undertook\
[0:02:22](https://youtu.be/7gAwa9i-Vrw?t=142) is um the scientific narratives\
[0:02:26](https://youtu.be/7gAwa9i-Vrw?t=146) narrative\
[0:02:27](https://youtu.be/7gAwa9i-Vrw?t=147) which has been out there for some time\
[0:02:30](https://youtu.be/7gAwa9i-Vrw?t=150) um i would say\
[0:02:31](https://youtu.be/7gAwa9i-Vrw?t=151) for the last 20 years ever since the\
[0:02:33](https://youtu.be/7gAwa9i-Vrw?t=153) scientific miracles narrative\
[0:02:35](https://youtu.be/7gAwa9i-Vrw?t=155) has been out there and so there has been\
[0:02:37](https://youtu.be/7gAwa9i-Vrw?t=157) kind of these\
[0:02:38](https://youtu.be/7gAwa9i-Vrw?t=158) uh back and fro kind of discussions\
[0:02:42](https://youtu.be/7gAwa9i-Vrw?t=162) between people who are advocating that\
[0:02:44](https://youtu.be/7gAwa9i-Vrw?t=164) this the quran is a scientific miracle\
[0:02:47](https://youtu.be/7gAwa9i-Vrw?t=167) because\
[0:02:47](https://youtu.be/7gAwa9i-Vrw?t=167) it contains information that couldn't\
[0:02:49](https://youtu.be/7gAwa9i-Vrw?t=169) have been known at the time\
[0:02:50](https://youtu.be/7gAwa9i-Vrw?t=170) and those on the other hand that are\
[0:02:52](https://youtu.be/7gAwa9i-Vrw?t=172) saying in fact the quran is not\
[0:02:54](https://youtu.be/7gAwa9i-Vrw?t=174) because it contains information which is\
[0:02:57](https://youtu.be/7gAwa9i-Vrw?t=177) contrary to modern science and these are\
[0:03:00](https://youtu.be/7gAwa9i-Vrw?t=180) competing claims\
[0:03:01](https://youtu.be/7gAwa9i-Vrw?t=181) so what we do is we come in the middle\
[0:03:03](https://youtu.be/7gAwa9i-Vrw?t=183) try and arbitrate these claims and say\
[0:03:05](https://youtu.be/7gAwa9i-Vrw?t=185) well hold on let's have a robust\
[0:03:06](https://youtu.be/7gAwa9i-Vrw?t=186) discussion number one is science\
[0:03:08](https://youtu.be/7gAwa9i-Vrw?t=188) corridorable or incorrigible\
[0:03:10](https://youtu.be/7gAwa9i-Vrw?t=190) is it transient or is it eternal in\
[0:03:12](https://youtu.be/7gAwa9i-Vrw?t=192) terms of its epistemic\
[0:03:14](https://youtu.be/7gAwa9i-Vrw?t=194) uh ability to produce truth number two\
[0:03:17](https://youtu.be/7gAwa9i-Vrw?t=197) are the\
[0:03:18](https://youtu.be/7gAwa9i-Vrw?t=198) verses of the quran are they or are they\
[0:03:21](https://youtu.be/7gAwa9i-Vrw?t=201) are they\
[0:03:22](https://youtu.be/7gAwa9i-Vrw?t=202) uh clear or are they ambiguous are they\
[0:03:27](https://youtu.be/7gAwa9i-Vrw?t=207) and then we say okay so what does the\
[0:03:28](https://youtu.be/7gAwa9i-Vrw?t=208) language allow there's a language allow\
[0:03:31](https://youtu.be/7gAwa9i-Vrw?t=211) this interpretation or this\
[0:03:32](https://youtu.be/7gAwa9i-Vrw?t=212) interpretation or even interesting\
[0:03:34](https://youtu.be/7gAwa9i-Vrw?t=214) enough does it allow both\
[0:03:35](https://youtu.be/7gAwa9i-Vrw?t=215) interpretations\
[0:03:36](https://youtu.be/7gAwa9i-Vrw?t=216) what does the president show what's the\
[0:03:38](https://youtu.be/7gAwa9i-Vrw?t=218) classical precedent\
[0:03:39](https://youtu.be/7gAwa9i-Vrw?t=219) what scholars said before this the the\
[0:03:42](https://youtu.be/7gAwa9i-Vrw?t=222) scientific revolution for example 16th\
[0:03:44](https://youtu.be/7gAwa9i-Vrw?t=224) century before\
[0:03:45](https://youtu.be/7gAwa9i-Vrw?t=225) things were very widely known to be\
[0:03:48](https://youtu.be/7gAwa9i-Vrw?t=228) scientifically true what were people\
[0:03:50](https://youtu.be/7gAwa9i-Vrw?t=230) saying\
[0:03:50](https://youtu.be/7gAwa9i-Vrw?t=230) in the 8th century the 9th century so we\
[0:03:52](https://youtu.be/7gAwa9i-Vrw?t=232) look at that\
[0:03:54](https://youtu.be/7gAwa9i-Vrw?t=234) and we have a team of very good\
[0:03:56](https://youtu.be/7gAwa9i-Vrw?t=236) researchers in the background\
[0:03:57](https://youtu.be/7gAwa9i-Vrw?t=237) helping us and gather all of these\
[0:03:59](https://youtu.be/7gAwa9i-Vrw?t=239) things and obviously this is an\
[0:04:00](https://youtu.be/7gAwa9i-Vrw?t=240) interdisciplinarian thing\
[0:04:02](https://youtu.be/7gAwa9i-Vrw?t=242) and we're putting philosophy of science\
[0:04:04](https://youtu.be/7gAwa9i-Vrw?t=244) in history of uh science\
[0:04:06](https://youtu.be/7gAwa9i-Vrw?t=246) um and the good news alhamdulillah is\
[0:04:08](https://youtu.be/7gAwa9i-Vrw?t=248) that we have completed\
[0:04:09](https://youtu.be/7gAwa9i-Vrw?t=249) the recording of this series so next\
[0:04:11](https://youtu.be/7gAwa9i-Vrw?t=251) week\
[0:04:12](https://youtu.be/7gAwa9i-Vrw?t=252) we already are uploading three videos\
[0:04:16](https://youtu.be/7gAwa9i-Vrw?t=256) per week the it should go up by next\
[0:04:19](https://youtu.be/7gAwa9i-Vrw?t=259) week to maybe five four to five videos a\
[0:04:21](https://youtu.be/7gAwa9i-Vrw?t=261) week\
[0:04:22](https://youtu.be/7gAwa9i-Vrw?t=262) uh of the sapiens thoughts um videos are\
[0:04:25](https://youtu.be/7gAwa9i-Vrw?t=265) going to\
[0:04:25](https://youtu.be/7gAwa9i-Vrw?t=265) go up and because what we have is a lot\
[0:04:28](https://youtu.be/7gAwa9i-Vrw?t=268) of\
[0:04:28](https://youtu.be/7gAwa9i-Vrw?t=268) as we have a backlog of uh information\
[0:04:31](https://youtu.be/7gAwa9i-Vrw?t=271) that has already been recorded\
[0:04:33](https://youtu.be/7gAwa9i-Vrw?t=273) that needs to go out there because now\
[0:04:34](https://youtu.be/7gAwa9i-Vrw?t=274) we want to go to the next\
[0:04:36](https://youtu.be/7gAwa9i-Vrw?t=276) set of uh contentions and\
[0:04:39](https://youtu.be/7gAwa9i-Vrw?t=279) arguments against got uh the gratitude\
[0:04:41](https://youtu.be/7gAwa9i-Vrw?t=281) of islam\
[0:04:42](https://youtu.be/7gAwa9i-Vrw?t=282) which is these kind of moral arguments\
[0:04:44](https://youtu.be/7gAwa9i-Vrw?t=284) when i kind of go into that\
[0:04:46](https://youtu.be/7gAwa9i-Vrw?t=286) that will be the next project and then\
[0:04:48](https://youtu.be/7gAwa9i-Vrw?t=288) obviously after that\
[0:04:49](https://youtu.be/7gAwa9i-Vrw?t=289) that or maybe during that we'll have to\
[0:04:51](https://youtu.be/7gAwa9i-Vrw?t=291) kind of discuss and see the logistics of\
[0:04:52](https://youtu.be/7gAwa9i-Vrw?t=292) it\
[0:04:53](https://youtu.be/7gAwa9i-Vrw?t=293) we're going to be giving arguments for\
[0:04:54](https://youtu.be/7gAwa9i-Vrw?t=294) the truthfulness of islam historical\
[0:04:56](https://youtu.be/7gAwa9i-Vrw?t=296) arguments predictions\
[0:04:58](https://youtu.be/7gAwa9i-Vrw?t=298) you know the preservation all of these\
[0:05:01](https://youtu.be/7gAwa9i-Vrw?t=301) kinds of things that you may have had\
[0:05:02](https://youtu.be/7gAwa9i-Vrw?t=302) before but we're going to kind of\
[0:05:03](https://youtu.be/7gAwa9i-Vrw?t=303) approach it from a different\
[0:05:04](https://youtu.be/7gAwa9i-Vrw?t=304) perspective when collaboration with uh\
[0:05:07](https://youtu.be/7gAwa9i-Vrw?t=307) great people from the\
[0:05:08](https://youtu.be/7gAwa9i-Vrw?t=308) the middle east and translating some of\
[0:05:11](https://youtu.be/7gAwa9i-Vrw?t=311) their works like a doctor\
[0:05:13](https://youtu.be/7gAwa9i-Vrw?t=313) who has uh you know books\
[0:05:16](https://youtu.be/7gAwa9i-Vrw?t=316) which are freely available in the arab\
[0:05:18](https://youtu.be/7gAwa9i-Vrw?t=318) world which were in the course of\
[0:05:20](https://youtu.be/7gAwa9i-Vrw?t=320) translating\
[0:05:21](https://youtu.be/7gAwa9i-Vrw?t=321) like um which is a\
[0:05:24](https://youtu.be/7gAwa9i-Vrw?t=324) big book that he has spent a lot of time\
[0:05:26](https://youtu.be/7gAwa9i-Vrw?t=326) on so we we're trying to pick the lower\
[0:05:28](https://youtu.be/7gAwa9i-Vrw?t=328) lane fruit\
[0:05:29](https://youtu.be/7gAwa9i-Vrw?t=329) bring all this kind of intellectual uh\
[0:05:31](https://youtu.be/7gAwa9i-Vrw?t=331) property together\
[0:05:32](https://youtu.be/7gAwa9i-Vrw?t=332) and information together and bring\
[0:05:35](https://youtu.be/7gAwa9i-Vrw?t=335) cutting-edge information\
[0:05:36](https://youtu.be/7gAwa9i-Vrw?t=336) uh and deliver it to the people\
[0:05:40](https://youtu.be/7gAwa9i-Vrw?t=340) so in a nutshell this is what we're\
[0:05:42](https://youtu.be/7gAwa9i-Vrw?t=342) trying to do\
[0:05:44](https://youtu.be/7gAwa9i-Vrw?t=344) absolutely for that um i'd like to jump\
[0:05:47](https://youtu.be/7gAwa9i-Vrw?t=347) straight in\
[0:05:48](https://youtu.be/7gAwa9i-Vrw?t=348) and go to the viewers uh we have our\
[0:05:51](https://youtu.be/7gAwa9i-Vrw?t=351) brother\
[0:05:51](https://youtu.be/7gAwa9i-Vrw?t=351) martial allah youssef who has some very\
[0:05:53](https://youtu.be/7gAwa9i-Vrw?t=353) colorful\
[0:05:54](https://youtu.be/7gAwa9i-Vrw?t=354) headphones welcome yusuf to sapience\
[0:05:58](https://youtu.be/7gAwa9i-Vrw?t=358) institute\
[0:05:59](https://youtu.be/7gAwa9i-Vrw?t=359) live let us know your questions let us\
[0:06:01](https://youtu.be/7gAwa9i-Vrw?t=361) know where you're coming from\
[0:06:03](https://youtu.be/7gAwa9i-Vrw?t=363) and just generally any other thing you\
[0:06:05](https://youtu.be/7gAwa9i-Vrw?t=365) want to share inshallah\
[0:06:11](https://youtu.be/7gAwa9i-Vrw?t=371) how are you doing brother alhamdulillah\
[0:06:16](https://youtu.be/7gAwa9i-Vrw?t=376) um so i have a bit of a it's a bit of a\
[0:06:18](https://youtu.be/7gAwa9i-Vrw?t=378) long\
[0:06:19](https://youtu.be/7gAwa9i-Vrw?t=379) uh question i was watching muhammad\
[0:06:21](https://youtu.be/7gAwa9i-Vrw?t=381) hijab i was watching your debate with\
[0:06:23](https://youtu.be/7gAwa9i-Vrw?t=383) edward uh tabash yes\
[0:06:26](https://youtu.be/7gAwa9i-Vrw?t=386) and he uh he was trying to refute the\
[0:06:30](https://youtu.be/7gAwa9i-Vrw?t=390) contingency argument\
[0:06:31](https://youtu.be/7gAwa9i-Vrw?t=391) yeah no i didn't i'm going to quote to\
[0:06:34](https://youtu.be/7gAwa9i-Vrw?t=394) you his refutation\
[0:06:37](https://youtu.be/7gAwa9i-Vrw?t=397) um and i would uh i want you to explain\
[0:06:40](https://youtu.be/7gAwa9i-Vrw?t=400) to me what his refutation is because i\
[0:06:42](https://youtu.be/7gAwa9i-Vrw?t=402) can't understand\
[0:06:44](https://youtu.be/7gAwa9i-Vrw?t=404) and why his refutation isn't correct so\
[0:06:47](https://youtu.be/7gAwa9i-Vrw?t=407) end quote he says a necessary fact\
[0:06:49](https://youtu.be/7gAwa9i-Vrw?t=409) cannot explain a contingent fact\
[0:06:51](https://youtu.be/7gAwa9i-Vrw?t=411) without introducing a fact in need of\
[0:06:54](https://youtu.be/7gAwa9i-Vrw?t=414) explanation\
[0:06:55](https://youtu.be/7gAwa9i-Vrw?t=415) if a necessary fact cannot explain a\
[0:06:57](https://youtu.be/7gAwa9i-Vrw?t=417) contingent fact except by entailing it\
[0:06:59](https://youtu.be/7gAwa9i-Vrw?t=419) because any fact entailed by a necessary\
[0:07:02](https://youtu.be/7gAwa9i-Vrw?t=422) fact\
[0:07:03](https://youtu.be/7gAwa9i-Vrw?t=423) must itself be necessary however the\
[0:07:06](https://youtu.be/7gAwa9i-Vrw?t=426) necessary fact does not entail the\
[0:07:07](https://youtu.be/7gAwa9i-Vrw?t=427) contingent fact\
[0:07:09](https://youtu.be/7gAwa9i-Vrw?t=429) then the explanatory explanatory\
[0:07:11](https://youtu.be/7gAwa9i-Vrw?t=431) connection\
[0:07:12](https://youtu.be/7gAwa9i-Vrw?t=432) it has to the contingent fact must be a\
[0:07:15](https://youtu.be/7gAwa9i-Vrw?t=435) contingent one\
[0:07:16](https://youtu.be/7gAwa9i-Vrw?t=436) which introduces a new contingent in\
[0:07:18](https://youtu.be/7gAwa9i-Vrw?t=438) fact in need of explanation\
[0:07:20](https://youtu.be/7gAwa9i-Vrw?t=440) and if the defender of the argument\
[0:07:21](https://youtu.be/7gAwa9i-Vrw?t=441) replies sorry\
[0:07:23](https://youtu.be/7gAwa9i-Vrw?t=443) sorry go back and go back three\
[0:07:28](https://youtu.be/7gAwa9i-Vrw?t=448) sentences\
[0:07:30](https://youtu.be/7gAwa9i-Vrw?t=450) the it has to the contingent fact must\
[0:07:32](https://youtu.be/7gAwa9i-Vrw?t=452) be in it might be a contingent one which\
[0:07:34](https://youtu.be/7gAwa9i-Vrw?t=454) introduces a new contingent in fact\
[0:07:36](https://youtu.be/7gAwa9i-Vrw?t=456) in need of explanation all right start\
[0:07:37](https://youtu.be/7gAwa9i-Vrw?t=457) again from the beginning sorry i i\
[0:07:39](https://youtu.be/7gAwa9i-Vrw?t=459) apologize i was not\
[0:07:40](https://youtu.be/7gAwa9i-Vrw?t=460) concentrating let me let me write this\
[0:07:43](https://youtu.be/7gAwa9i-Vrw?t=463) down so that\
[0:07:44](https://youtu.be/7gAwa9i-Vrw?t=464) i'm sure that got pen okay\
[0:07:48](https://youtu.be/7gAwa9i-Vrw?t=468) even i even i wrote it down myself all\
[0:07:50](https://youtu.be/7gAwa9i-Vrw?t=470) right so let's let's see what we have to\
[0:07:52](https://youtu.be/7gAwa9i-Vrw?t=472) say go ahead\
[0:07:53](https://youtu.be/7gAwa9i-Vrw?t=473) okay so a necessary fact cannot explain\
[0:07:56](https://youtu.be/7gAwa9i-Vrw?t=476) a contingent fact\
[0:07:58](https://youtu.be/7gAwa9i-Vrw?t=478) without introducing a fact\
[0:08:01](https://youtu.be/7gAwa9i-Vrw?t=481) in need of explanation without\
[0:08:04](https://youtu.be/7gAwa9i-Vrw?t=484) without without without uh introducing\
[0:08:08](https://youtu.be/7gAwa9i-Vrw?t=488) uh a contingent fact in need of\
[0:08:10](https://youtu.be/7gAwa9i-Vrw?t=490) explanation\
[0:08:14](https://youtu.be/7gAwa9i-Vrw?t=494) okay let's do one on our time otherwise\
[0:08:16](https://youtu.be/7gAwa9i-Vrw?t=496) it's impossible yeah\
[0:08:17](https://youtu.be/7gAwa9i-Vrw?t=497) sure okay okay so let's let's deal with\
[0:08:20](https://youtu.be/7gAwa9i-Vrw?t=500) that one\
[0:08:21](https://youtu.be/7gAwa9i-Vrw?t=501) all right a necessary fact cannot\
[0:08:24](https://youtu.be/7gAwa9i-Vrw?t=504) explain a contingent fact\
[0:08:26](https://youtu.be/7gAwa9i-Vrw?t=506) okay without introducing a contingent\
[0:08:29](https://youtu.be/7gAwa9i-Vrw?t=509) fact\
[0:08:31](https://youtu.be/7gAwa9i-Vrw?t=511) in need of explanation okay this\
[0:08:34](https://youtu.be/7gAwa9i-Vrw?t=514) already is a mischaracterization of the\
[0:08:36](https://youtu.be/7gAwa9i-Vrw?t=516) argument that's put forward on two\
[0:08:38](https://youtu.be/7gAwa9i-Vrw?t=518) grounds okay that's\
[0:08:39](https://youtu.be/7gAwa9i-Vrw?t=519) because we otherwise you're just gonna\
[0:08:40](https://youtu.be/7gAwa9i-Vrw?t=520) read all of what he has to say\
[0:08:42](https://youtu.be/7gAwa9i-Vrw?t=522) this first instance this first sentence\
[0:08:45](https://youtu.be/7gAwa9i-Vrw?t=525) already for me and i remember\
[0:08:47](https://youtu.be/7gAwa9i-Vrw?t=527) writing this down when we had the debate\
[0:08:50](https://youtu.be/7gAwa9i-Vrw?t=530) in california at that time\
[0:08:52](https://youtu.be/7gAwa9i-Vrw?t=532) and seeing what he's trying to say but\
[0:08:55](https://youtu.be/7gAwa9i-Vrw?t=535) look first of all we're not talking\
[0:08:56](https://youtu.be/7gAwa9i-Vrw?t=536) about necessary facts we're talking\
[0:08:58](https://youtu.be/7gAwa9i-Vrw?t=538) about necessary existences\
[0:09:00](https://youtu.be/7gAwa9i-Vrw?t=540) so here's what we need to distinguish\
[0:09:02](https://youtu.be/7gAwa9i-Vrw?t=542) between okay\
[0:09:03](https://youtu.be/7gAwa9i-Vrw?t=543) you have these universals or you can\
[0:09:05](https://youtu.be/7gAwa9i-Vrw?t=545) call them transcendental universals\
[0:09:07](https://youtu.be/7gAwa9i-Vrw?t=547) you can call them categories uh master\
[0:09:10](https://youtu.be/7gAwa9i-Vrw?t=550) key categories\
[0:09:11](https://youtu.be/7gAwa9i-Vrw?t=551) so for instance if i say a master key\
[0:09:14](https://youtu.be/7gAwa9i-Vrw?t=554) category or\
[0:09:15](https://youtu.be/7gAwa9i-Vrw?t=555) you can even call them geniuses okay\
[0:09:17](https://youtu.be/7gAwa9i-Vrw?t=557) genus yeah\
[0:09:19](https://youtu.be/7gAwa9i-Vrw?t=559) so for instance let's say a master key\
[0:09:21](https://youtu.be/7gAwa9i-Vrw?t=561) category is\
[0:09:23](https://youtu.be/7gAwa9i-Vrw?t=563) fatherhood okay fatherhood or let's say\
[0:09:26](https://youtu.be/7gAwa9i-Vrw?t=566) another master key category is existence\
[0:09:30](https://youtu.be/7gAwa9i-Vrw?t=570) okay you can say other master key\
[0:09:32](https://youtu.be/7gAwa9i-Vrw?t=572) categories facts\
[0:09:33](https://youtu.be/7gAwa9i-Vrw?t=573) now facts and existences are not the\
[0:09:35](https://youtu.be/7gAwa9i-Vrw?t=575) same thing they're not interchangeable\
[0:09:38](https://youtu.be/7gAwa9i-Vrw?t=578) my argument was never based on facts was\
[0:09:41](https://youtu.be/7gAwa9i-Vrw?t=581) a necessary fact and what's a contingent\
[0:09:43](https://youtu.be/7gAwa9i-Vrw?t=583) fact and this is very important\
[0:09:45](https://youtu.be/7gAwa9i-Vrw?t=585) the category that i was talking about\
[0:09:48](https://youtu.be/7gAwa9i-Vrw?t=588) was\
[0:09:48](https://youtu.be/7gAwa9i-Vrw?t=588) not the category of necessary facts or\
[0:09:52](https://youtu.be/7gAwa9i-Vrw?t=592) contingent\
[0:09:52](https://youtu.be/7gAwa9i-Vrw?t=592) facts the category which is important\
[0:09:55](https://youtu.be/7gAwa9i-Vrw?t=595) that needs to be\
[0:09:56](https://youtu.be/7gAwa9i-Vrw?t=596) paid attention to is existence\
[0:10:00](https://youtu.be/7gAwa9i-Vrw?t=600) so already this is a it's\
[0:10:02](https://youtu.be/7gAwa9i-Vrw?t=602) mischaracterization of the argument yeah\
[0:10:04](https://youtu.be/7gAwa9i-Vrw?t=604) because he says unnecessary fact cannot\
[0:10:06](https://youtu.be/7gAwa9i-Vrw?t=606) explain a contingent fact\
[0:10:08](https://youtu.be/7gAwa9i-Vrw?t=608) without introducing contingent facts in\
[0:10:12](https://youtu.be/7gAwa9i-Vrw?t=612) need of explanation\
[0:10:13](https://youtu.be/7gAwa9i-Vrw?t=613) okay well we're not talking about\
[0:10:15](https://youtu.be/7gAwa9i-Vrw?t=615) necessary facts and contingent facts the\
[0:10:17](https://youtu.be/7gAwa9i-Vrw?t=617) only\
[0:10:18](https://youtu.be/7gAwa9i-Vrw?t=618) part of that debate which i remember\
[0:10:19](https://youtu.be/7gAwa9i-Vrw?t=619) talking about necessary facts\
[0:10:21](https://youtu.be/7gAwa9i-Vrw?t=621) was when i said two plus two equals four\
[0:10:23](https://youtu.be/7gAwa9i-Vrw?t=623) is a necessary fact\
[0:10:25](https://youtu.be/7gAwa9i-Vrw?t=625) but i was using that as an analogy for\
[0:10:28](https://youtu.be/7gAwa9i-Vrw?t=628) necessary existences not as uh\
[0:10:30](https://youtu.be/7gAwa9i-Vrw?t=630) interchangeable with it\
[0:10:32](https://youtu.be/7gAwa9i-Vrw?t=632) which is a very important misconception\
[0:10:34](https://youtu.be/7gAwa9i-Vrw?t=634) i think i need to\
[0:10:35](https://youtu.be/7gAwa9i-Vrw?t=635) clarify right so there's a difference\
[0:10:37](https://youtu.be/7gAwa9i-Vrw?t=637) between\
[0:10:38](https://youtu.be/7gAwa9i-Vrw?t=638) facts and existences why do we have to\
[0:10:41](https://youtu.be/7gAwa9i-Vrw?t=641) deal with existences\
[0:10:42](https://youtu.be/7gAwa9i-Vrw?t=642) because existences is the base of\
[0:10:44](https://youtu.be/7gAwa9i-Vrw?t=644) everything\
[0:10:46](https://youtu.be/7gAwa9i-Vrw?t=646) that my argument started and this is not\
[0:10:48](https://youtu.be/7gAwa9i-Vrw?t=648) actually my argument\
[0:10:49](https://youtu.be/7gAwa9i-Vrw?t=649) but let's be honest it's the argument of\
[0:10:51](https://youtu.be/7gAwa9i-Vrw?t=651) avicenna it starts with\
[0:10:53](https://youtu.be/7gAwa9i-Vrw?t=653) there is no doubt that there is\
[0:10:55](https://youtu.be/7gAwa9i-Vrw?t=655) existence\
[0:10:56](https://youtu.be/7gAwa9i-Vrw?t=656) okay there's no sheikh there's no doubt\
[0:11:00](https://youtu.be/7gAwa9i-Vrw?t=660) that there is\
[0:11:01](https://youtu.be/7gAwa9i-Vrw?t=661) there is there is existence is\
[0:11:03](https://youtu.be/7gAwa9i-Vrw?t=663) difference to\
[0:11:04](https://youtu.be/7gAwa9i-Vrw?t=664) facts is existence yeah\
[0:11:08](https://youtu.be/7gAwa9i-Vrw?t=668) so the monthly category that i'm the or\
[0:11:10](https://youtu.be/7gAwa9i-Vrw?t=670) the universal the transcendental\
[0:11:11](https://youtu.be/7gAwa9i-Vrw?t=671) universal\
[0:11:12](https://youtu.be/7gAwa9i-Vrw?t=672) i'm dealing with here is not the\
[0:11:13](https://youtu.be/7gAwa9i-Vrw?t=673) transcendental universal of\
[0:11:15](https://youtu.be/7gAwa9i-Vrw?t=675) facts i am dealing with the\
[0:11:18](https://youtu.be/7gAwa9i-Vrw?t=678) transcendental universal\
[0:11:19](https://youtu.be/7gAwa9i-Vrw?t=679) of existences number one\
[0:11:23](https://youtu.be/7gAwa9i-Vrw?t=683) so let's rephrase this if if he says a\
[0:11:26](https://youtu.be/7gAwa9i-Vrw?t=686) necessary existence cannot\
[0:11:28](https://youtu.be/7gAwa9i-Vrw?t=688) explain\
[0:11:31](https://youtu.be/7gAwa9i-Vrw?t=691) instead of saying what he said which is\
[0:11:32](https://youtu.be/7gAwa9i-Vrw?t=692) which is a a\
[0:11:34](https://youtu.be/7gAwa9i-Vrw?t=694) necessary fact so if we if we\
[0:11:37](https://youtu.be/7gAwa9i-Vrw?t=697) re-characterize it as per\
[0:11:38](https://youtu.be/7gAwa9i-Vrw?t=698) what we're talking about which is the\
[0:11:40](https://youtu.be/7gAwa9i-Vrw?t=700) category of existence let's see if his\
[0:11:42](https://youtu.be/7gAwa9i-Vrw?t=702) argument has any way\
[0:11:44](https://youtu.be/7gAwa9i-Vrw?t=704) a necessary existence cannot explain\
[0:11:47](https://youtu.be/7gAwa9i-Vrw?t=707) a contingent existence without\
[0:11:49](https://youtu.be/7gAwa9i-Vrw?t=709) introducing a contingent existence\
[0:11:51](https://youtu.be/7gAwa9i-Vrw?t=711) in need of explanation that's false\
[0:11:54](https://youtu.be/7gAwa9i-Vrw?t=714) that's not true how is that true he has\
[0:11:56](https://youtu.be/7gAwa9i-Vrw?t=716) to that's that's a claim that's\
[0:11:58](https://youtu.be/7gAwa9i-Vrw?t=718) unevidenced\
[0:11:59](https://youtu.be/7gAwa9i-Vrw?t=719) right he's saying that unnecessary\
[0:12:02](https://youtu.be/7gAwa9i-Vrw?t=722) existence cannot explain\
[0:12:04](https://youtu.be/7gAwa9i-Vrw?t=724) a contingent existence let's say that\
[0:12:06](https://youtu.be/7gAwa9i-Vrw?t=726) because he's got it wrong\
[0:12:07](https://youtu.be/7gAwa9i-Vrw?t=727) facts the facts and existences are two\
[0:12:09](https://youtu.be/7gAwa9i-Vrw?t=729) different things and necessary existence\
[0:12:11](https://youtu.be/7gAwa9i-Vrw?t=731) cannot explain\
[0:12:12](https://youtu.be/7gAwa9i-Vrw?t=732) a contingent existence without\
[0:12:14](https://youtu.be/7gAwa9i-Vrw?t=734) introducing a contingent existence\
[0:12:16](https://youtu.be/7gAwa9i-Vrw?t=736) in need of expression that's absolutely\
[0:12:17](https://youtu.be/7gAwa9i-Vrw?t=737) false we believe that the necessary\
[0:12:19](https://youtu.be/7gAwa9i-Vrw?t=739) existence\
[0:12:21](https://youtu.be/7gAwa9i-Vrw?t=741) is the cumulative result\
[0:12:24](https://youtu.be/7gAwa9i-Vrw?t=744) okay of reasoning from contingency\
[0:12:29](https://youtu.be/7gAwa9i-Vrw?t=749) so what he's what he's supposing is that\
[0:12:31](https://youtu.be/7gAwa9i-Vrw?t=751) we're starting from\
[0:12:33](https://youtu.be/7gAwa9i-Vrw?t=753) uh we're starting from necessity and\
[0:12:35](https://youtu.be/7gAwa9i-Vrw?t=755) arguing back\
[0:12:36](https://youtu.be/7gAwa9i-Vrw?t=756) to contingency but what we're actually\
[0:12:39](https://youtu.be/7gAwa9i-Vrw?t=759) doing or what we actually have done\
[0:12:41](https://youtu.be/7gAwa9i-Vrw?t=761) is we have started from contingency and\
[0:12:44](https://youtu.be/7gAwa9i-Vrw?t=764) argued towards\
[0:12:45](https://youtu.be/7gAwa9i-Vrw?t=765) necessity the way the argument the form\
[0:12:48](https://youtu.be/7gAwa9i-Vrw?t=768) of the argument which she has miscap\
[0:12:50](https://youtu.be/7gAwa9i-Vrw?t=770) mischaracterized is not that because\
[0:12:53](https://youtu.be/7gAwa9i-Vrw?t=773) this would be a circular argument if we\
[0:12:55](https://youtu.be/7gAwa9i-Vrw?t=775) said that\
[0:12:56](https://youtu.be/7gAwa9i-Vrw?t=776) the necessary existence explains\
[0:12:59](https://youtu.be/7gAwa9i-Vrw?t=779) contingent existences well that would\
[0:13:02](https://youtu.be/7gAwa9i-Vrw?t=782) exactly be begging the question that\
[0:13:03](https://youtu.be/7gAwa9i-Vrw?t=783) would be\
[0:13:04](https://youtu.be/7gAwa9i-Vrw?t=784) me putting the first premise as the\
[0:13:06](https://youtu.be/7gAwa9i-Vrw?t=786) conclusion so that's not the way that we\
[0:13:08](https://youtu.be/7gAwa9i-Vrw?t=788) have\
[0:13:09](https://youtu.be/7gAwa9i-Vrw?t=789) uh argued in the debate and this is not\
[0:13:11](https://youtu.be/7gAwa9i-Vrw?t=791) the contingency again\
[0:13:13](https://youtu.be/7gAwa9i-Vrw?t=793) the contingency argument says there\
[0:13:15](https://youtu.be/7gAwa9i-Vrw?t=795) cannot be a world with only possible\
[0:13:17](https://youtu.be/7gAwa9i-Vrw?t=797) existences\
[0:13:18](https://youtu.be/7gAwa9i-Vrw?t=798) this is what it's saying it's saying\
[0:13:19](https://youtu.be/7gAwa9i-Vrw?t=799) that a world it's inconceivable and this\
[0:13:23](https://youtu.be/7gAwa9i-Vrw?t=803) is called\
[0:13:23](https://youtu.be/7gAwa9i-Vrw?t=803) it's called argumentum add absurdum\
[0:13:27](https://youtu.be/7gAwa9i-Vrw?t=807) okay argumentum adam absurdum is to\
[0:13:29](https://youtu.be/7gAwa9i-Vrw?t=809) let's try\
[0:13:30](https://youtu.be/7gAwa9i-Vrw?t=810) and conceive of a world with only\
[0:13:32](https://youtu.be/7gAwa9i-Vrw?t=812) possible existences or to be specific\
[0:13:34](https://youtu.be/7gAwa9i-Vrw?t=814) let's try and conceive of a series of\
[0:13:38](https://youtu.be/7gAwa9i-Vrw?t=818) things\
[0:13:39](https://youtu.be/7gAwa9i-Vrw?t=819) existence thing existing things\
[0:13:42](https://youtu.be/7gAwa9i-Vrw?t=822) wherein all of those theories are\
[0:13:45](https://youtu.be/7gAwa9i-Vrw?t=825) contingently existing not\
[0:13:46](https://youtu.be/7gAwa9i-Vrw?t=826) uh necessary existence we will say that\
[0:13:49](https://youtu.be/7gAwa9i-Vrw?t=829) such series cannot exist\
[0:13:51](https://youtu.be/7gAwa9i-Vrw?t=831) without something outside of it\
[0:13:55](https://youtu.be/7gAwa9i-Vrw?t=835) which is necessary in order to explicate\
[0:13:58](https://youtu.be/7gAwa9i-Vrw?t=838) it or\
[0:13:58](https://youtu.be/7gAwa9i-Vrw?t=838) explain it all the series itself has to\
[0:14:01](https://youtu.be/7gAwa9i-Vrw?t=841) be necessary\
[0:14:02](https://youtu.be/7gAwa9i-Vrw?t=842) in which case we will say how could it\
[0:14:04](https://youtu.be/7gAwa9i-Vrw?t=844) be when\
[0:14:06](https://youtu.be/7gAwa9i-Vrw?t=846) it can be rearranged or that you can\
[0:14:08](https://youtu.be/7gAwa9i-Vrw?t=848) conceive of adding and subtracting to it\
[0:14:10](https://youtu.be/7gAwa9i-Vrw?t=850) so that's the form of the argument so in\
[0:14:12](https://youtu.be/7gAwa9i-Vrw?t=852) other words to say\
[0:14:13](https://youtu.be/7gAwa9i-Vrw?t=853) that unnecessary fact cannot explain a\
[0:14:15](https://youtu.be/7gAwa9i-Vrw?t=855) contingent fact without introducing a\
[0:14:17](https://youtu.be/7gAwa9i-Vrw?t=857) contingent fact\
[0:14:19](https://youtu.be/7gAwa9i-Vrw?t=859) in need of explanation number one is\
[0:14:21](https://youtu.be/7gAwa9i-Vrw?t=861) mischaracterization on two counts\
[0:14:23](https://youtu.be/7gAwa9i-Vrw?t=863) because that's not the form of the\
[0:14:24](https://youtu.be/7gAwa9i-Vrw?t=864) argument we have not even mentioned the\
[0:14:26](https://youtu.be/7gAwa9i-Vrw?t=866) words\
[0:14:27](https://youtu.be/7gAwa9i-Vrw?t=867) facts is not what we were talking about\
[0:14:29](https://youtu.be/7gAwa9i-Vrw?t=869) we were talking about existences\
[0:14:31](https://youtu.be/7gAwa9i-Vrw?t=871) that's number one number two uh\
[0:14:34](https://youtu.be/7gAwa9i-Vrw?t=874) we weren't arguing in a circle we\
[0:14:36](https://youtu.be/7gAwa9i-Vrw?t=876) weren't arguing from necessary existence\
[0:14:38](https://youtu.be/7gAwa9i-Vrw?t=878) to contingent existence\
[0:14:39](https://youtu.be/7gAwa9i-Vrw?t=879) in indeed we're in fact doing the exact\
[0:14:42](https://youtu.be/7gAwa9i-Vrw?t=882) opposite of that which is arguing from\
[0:14:43](https://youtu.be/7gAwa9i-Vrw?t=883) contingency to necessity does that\
[0:14:45](https://youtu.be/7gAwa9i-Vrw?t=885) answer the question\
[0:14:47](https://youtu.be/7gAwa9i-Vrw?t=887) uh yes it does thank you very much\
[0:14:50](https://youtu.be/7gAwa9i-Vrw?t=890) yeah uh the i have one one question is\
[0:14:53](https://youtu.be/7gAwa9i-Vrw?t=893) the last question\
[0:14:55](https://youtu.be/7gAwa9i-Vrw?t=895) same debate um you also mentioned how\
[0:14:58](https://youtu.be/7gAwa9i-Vrw?t=898) burton russell said that\
[0:14:59](https://youtu.be/7gAwa9i-Vrw?t=899) the argument from causation or cause and\
[0:15:01](https://youtu.be/7gAwa9i-Vrw?t=901) effect has the fallacy of\
[0:15:03](https://youtu.be/7gAwa9i-Vrw?t=903) composition yes so\
[0:15:07](https://youtu.be/7gAwa9i-Vrw?t=907) i want you to like uh request that you\
[0:15:10](https://youtu.be/7gAwa9i-Vrw?t=910) explain that a bit more because i don't\
[0:15:13](https://youtu.be/7gAwa9i-Vrw?t=913) kind of\
[0:15:14](https://youtu.be/7gAwa9i-Vrw?t=914) see it and why would this fallacy\
[0:15:18](https://youtu.be/7gAwa9i-Vrw?t=918) maybe you know for example why wouldn't\
[0:15:19](https://youtu.be/7gAwa9i-Vrw?t=919) it apply to contingency\
[0:15:21](https://youtu.be/7gAwa9i-Vrw?t=921) why only cause effect yeah that's it\
[0:15:23](https://youtu.be/7gAwa9i-Vrw?t=923) though thank you\
[0:15:25](https://youtu.be/7gAwa9i-Vrw?t=925) the argument the the contingency sorry\
[0:15:27](https://youtu.be/7gAwa9i-Vrw?t=927) the cosmo um the composition fallacy\
[0:15:29](https://youtu.be/7gAwa9i-Vrw?t=929) is the in my opinion anyway it's the\
[0:15:31](https://youtu.be/7gAwa9i-Vrw?t=931) most\
[0:15:32](https://youtu.be/7gAwa9i-Vrw?t=932) uh severe um logical\
[0:15:36](https://youtu.be/7gAwa9i-Vrw?t=936) um objection and probably the one of the\
[0:15:39](https://youtu.be/7gAwa9i-Vrw?t=939) most\
[0:15:41](https://youtu.be/7gAwa9i-Vrw?t=941) you know um i would say uh\
[0:15:45](https://youtu.be/7gAwa9i-Vrw?t=945) serious actually objections to the the\
[0:15:48](https://youtu.be/7gAwa9i-Vrw?t=948) calam cosmological argument from a\
[0:15:49](https://youtu.be/7gAwa9i-Vrw?t=949) brazilian perspective\
[0:15:51](https://youtu.be/7gAwa9i-Vrw?t=951) and i'll explain to you what this is\
[0:15:52](https://youtu.be/7gAwa9i-Vrw?t=952) first of all the argument goes as\
[0:15:54](https://youtu.be/7gAwa9i-Vrw?t=954) follows we're saying that\
[0:15:57](https://youtu.be/7gAwa9i-Vrw?t=957) you've got two kinds of fallacy you've\
[0:15:59](https://youtu.be/7gAwa9i-Vrw?t=959) got the fallacy of composition and you\
[0:16:00](https://youtu.be/7gAwa9i-Vrw?t=960) have the fallacy of division\
[0:16:02](https://youtu.be/7gAwa9i-Vrw?t=962) okay these are opposites in fact the\
[0:16:05](https://youtu.be/7gAwa9i-Vrw?t=965) fallacy of division is the opposite to\
[0:16:06](https://youtu.be/7gAwa9i-Vrw?t=966) the fallacy of composition\
[0:16:08](https://youtu.be/7gAwa9i-Vrw?t=968) and just for your notes\
[0:16:11](https://youtu.be/7gAwa9i-Vrw?t=971) um this whole study is called myriology\
[0:16:15](https://youtu.be/7gAwa9i-Vrw?t=975) muriology is the body of parts and holes\
[0:16:18](https://youtu.be/7gAwa9i-Vrw?t=978) parts and holes\
[0:16:26](https://youtu.be/7gAwa9i-Vrw?t=986) so the study apartment which has by the\
[0:16:27](https://youtu.be/7gAwa9i-Vrw?t=987) way taking and like with analytic\
[0:16:29](https://youtu.be/7gAwa9i-Vrw?t=989) philosophy now in the 21st century has\
[0:16:31](https://youtu.be/7gAwa9i-Vrw?t=991) taken different forms like it's\
[0:16:32](https://youtu.be/7gAwa9i-Vrw?t=992) it's undergone different kinds of uh\
[0:16:35](https://youtu.be/7gAwa9i-Vrw?t=995) formulations yeah\
[0:16:36](https://youtu.be/7gAwa9i-Vrw?t=996) but the point is this they're saying\
[0:16:38](https://youtu.be/7gAwa9i-Vrw?t=998) look\
[0:16:40](https://youtu.be/7gAwa9i-Vrw?t=1000) he bertrand russell he said\
[0:16:43](https://youtu.be/7gAwa9i-Vrw?t=1003) that with his uh in his discussion with\
[0:16:46](https://youtu.be/7gAwa9i-Vrw?t=1006) um\
[0:16:47](https://youtu.be/7gAwa9i-Vrw?t=1007) uh called kostenkopson\
[0:16:50](https://youtu.be/7gAwa9i-Vrw?t=1010) in the radio debate he said right\
[0:16:53](https://youtu.be/7gAwa9i-Vrw?t=1013) yeah yeah yeah yeah yeah i thought yeah\
[0:16:56](https://youtu.be/7gAwa9i-Vrw?t=1016) i forget exactly as brown\
[0:16:58](https://youtu.be/7gAwa9i-Vrw?t=1018) but he said he was not just a priest to\
[0:17:00](https://youtu.be/7gAwa9i-Vrw?t=1020) be fair he was actually\
[0:17:02](https://youtu.be/7gAwa9i-Vrw?t=1022) a very serious philosopher as well um\
[0:17:05](https://youtu.be/7gAwa9i-Vrw?t=1025) and and basically said just because\
[0:17:08](https://youtu.be/7gAwa9i-Vrw?t=1028) that human beings have a mother and\
[0:17:10](https://youtu.be/7gAwa9i-Vrw?t=1030) father it doesn't mean humankind has a\
[0:17:12](https://youtu.be/7gAwa9i-Vrw?t=1032) mother and father right\
[0:17:13](https://youtu.be/7gAwa9i-Vrw?t=1033) and so this is what bertrand russell was\
[0:17:14](https://youtu.be/7gAwa9i-Vrw?t=1034) saying in other words he's saying this\
[0:17:16](https://youtu.be/7gAwa9i-Vrw?t=1036) an elephant is so big or small to our to\
[0:17:20](https://youtu.be/7gAwa9i-Vrw?t=1040) in\
[0:17:21](https://youtu.be/7gAwa9i-Vrw?t=1041) comparative to us is it bigger it's big\
[0:17:24](https://youtu.be/7gAwa9i-Vrw?t=1044) it's a big one yeah now an elephant is\
[0:17:27](https://youtu.be/7gAwa9i-Vrw?t=1047) composed of\
[0:17:29](https://youtu.be/7gAwa9i-Vrw?t=1049) many different atoms now our atoms big\
[0:17:32](https://youtu.be/7gAwa9i-Vrw?t=1052) or small\
[0:17:34](https://youtu.be/7gAwa9i-Vrw?t=1054) compared to us they're small yeah so\
[0:17:38](https://youtu.be/7gAwa9i-Vrw?t=1058) yes so you have the big elephant which\
[0:17:40](https://youtu.be/7gAwa9i-Vrw?t=1060) is made up of small atoms yes\
[0:17:44](https://youtu.be/7gAwa9i-Vrw?t=1064) yeah all right good now here's the point\
[0:17:46](https://youtu.be/7gAwa9i-Vrw?t=1066) he was saying this if we're saying\
[0:17:47](https://youtu.be/7gAwa9i-Vrw?t=1067) everything that begins to exist has a\
[0:17:49](https://youtu.be/7gAwa9i-Vrw?t=1069) cause\
[0:17:50](https://youtu.be/7gAwa9i-Vrw?t=1070) the universe began to exist therefore\
[0:17:51](https://youtu.be/7gAwa9i-Vrw?t=1071) the universe has a cause\
[0:17:53](https://youtu.be/7gAwa9i-Vrw?t=1073) yes are you with me so far yes yes\
[0:17:56](https://youtu.be/7gAwa9i-Vrw?t=1076) how do we know that the universe has a\
[0:17:58](https://youtu.be/7gAwa9i-Vrw?t=1078) cause because\
[0:18:00](https://youtu.be/7gAwa9i-Vrw?t=1080) or how do we argue for it if we use this\
[0:18:03](https://youtu.be/7gAwa9i-Vrw?t=1083) form of the argument\
[0:18:05](https://youtu.be/7gAwa9i-Vrw?t=1085) we argue for it by saying that since\
[0:18:07](https://youtu.be/7gAwa9i-Vrw?t=1087) there are causes within the universe the\
[0:18:09](https://youtu.be/7gAwa9i-Vrw?t=1089) universe itself must have a\
[0:18:11](https://youtu.be/7gAwa9i-Vrw?t=1091) course are you with\
[0:18:14](https://youtu.be/7gAwa9i-Vrw?t=1094) okay good so far so good right so he's\
[0:18:17](https://youtu.be/7gAwa9i-Vrw?t=1097) saying\
[0:18:18](https://youtu.be/7gAwa9i-Vrw?t=1098) but there is clearly a disparity between\
[0:18:20](https://youtu.be/7gAwa9i-Vrw?t=1100) the part\
[0:18:21](https://youtu.be/7gAwa9i-Vrw?t=1101) and the whole so in other words\
[0:18:24](https://youtu.be/7gAwa9i-Vrw?t=1104) for example the elephant is made up of\
[0:18:27](https://youtu.be/7gAwa9i-Vrw?t=1107) small atoms and yet the elephant is big\
[0:18:31](https://youtu.be/7gAwa9i-Vrw?t=1111) so you can have a difference in property\
[0:18:34](https://youtu.be/7gAwa9i-Vrw?t=1114) between that which is\
[0:18:36](https://youtu.be/7gAwa9i-Vrw?t=1116) a part of something and the larger part\
[0:18:38](https://youtu.be/7gAwa9i-Vrw?t=1118) of it\
[0:18:39](https://youtu.be/7gAwa9i-Vrw?t=1119) in the case of the elephant you have\
[0:18:41](https://youtu.be/7gAwa9i-Vrw?t=1121) small atoms making up a big elephant\
[0:18:43](https://youtu.be/7gAwa9i-Vrw?t=1123) are you with me so far\
[0:18:46](https://youtu.be/7gAwa9i-Vrw?t=1126) yeah yeah i am here you're saying that\
[0:18:49](https://youtu.be/7gAwa9i-Vrw?t=1129) the universe itself has a cause because\
[0:18:51](https://youtu.be/7gAwa9i-Vrw?t=1131) the universe has causes within it\
[0:18:54](https://youtu.be/7gAwa9i-Vrw?t=1134) you he's saying it's the same problem\
[0:18:58](https://youtu.be/7gAwa9i-Vrw?t=1138) you got the same problem you're saying\
[0:18:59](https://youtu.be/7gAwa9i-Vrw?t=1139) that you're doing tamim you're doing\
[0:19:00](https://youtu.be/7gAwa9i-Vrw?t=1140) generalization\
[0:19:01](https://youtu.be/7gAwa9i-Vrw?t=1141) you're saying because what's in it is\
[0:19:03](https://youtu.be/7gAwa9i-Vrw?t=1143) small the whole thing must be small\
[0:19:05](https://youtu.be/7gAwa9i-Vrw?t=1145) yeah so it's because what's within it\
[0:19:08](https://youtu.be/7gAwa9i-Vrw?t=1148) are causes yeah\
[0:19:10](https://youtu.be/7gAwa9i-Vrw?t=1150) the whole thing must have a cause now\
[0:19:13](https://youtu.be/7gAwa9i-Vrw?t=1153) here's the problem\
[0:19:15](https://youtu.be/7gAwa9i-Vrw?t=1155) the fallacy of composition only works\
[0:19:18](https://youtu.be/7gAwa9i-Vrw?t=1158) when you have a full knowledge of the\
[0:19:20](https://youtu.be/7gAwa9i-Vrw?t=1160) whole\
[0:19:21](https://youtu.be/7gAwa9i-Vrw?t=1161) okay now let me explain if i have\
[0:19:25](https://youtu.be/7gAwa9i-Vrw?t=1165) if i say the the the uh\
[0:19:29](https://youtu.be/7gAwa9i-Vrw?t=1169) brick wall is made up of red bricks\
[0:19:34](https://youtu.be/7gAwa9i-Vrw?t=1174) now each brick is what color\
[0:19:37](https://youtu.be/7gAwa9i-Vrw?t=1177) red red and the wall is what color\
[0:19:41](https://youtu.be/7gAwa9i-Vrw?t=1181) red red so is there is there\
[0:19:44](https://youtu.be/7gAwa9i-Vrw?t=1184) compatibility here\
[0:19:45](https://youtu.be/7gAwa9i-Vrw?t=1185) between the part and the hole yeah how\
[0:19:48](https://youtu.be/7gAwa9i-Vrw?t=1188) do i know\
[0:19:49](https://youtu.be/7gAwa9i-Vrw?t=1189) how do i know because you absorb\
[0:19:52](https://youtu.be/7gAwa9i-Vrw?t=1192) observed\
[0:19:53](https://youtu.be/7gAwa9i-Vrw?t=1193) the whole because i've observed the\
[0:19:55](https://youtu.be/7gAwa9i-Vrw?t=1195) whole has anyone observed the universe\
[0:19:56](https://youtu.be/7gAwa9i-Vrw?t=1196) from a outside perspective no\
[0:20:00](https://youtu.be/7gAwa9i-Vrw?t=1200) no so can we make claims about the\
[0:20:02](https://youtu.be/7gAwa9i-Vrw?t=1202) universe\
[0:20:03](https://youtu.be/7gAwa9i-Vrw?t=1203) interesting what this does the problem\
[0:20:06](https://youtu.be/7gAwa9i-Vrw?t=1206) here\
[0:20:08](https://youtu.be/7gAwa9i-Vrw?t=1208) what this does is it basically stunts\
[0:20:11](https://youtu.be/7gAwa9i-Vrw?t=1211) the discussion because\
[0:20:12](https://youtu.be/7gAwa9i-Vrw?t=1212) either one of those people cannot say\
[0:20:14](https://youtu.be/7gAwa9i-Vrw?t=1214) like the theists cannot say\
[0:20:16](https://youtu.be/7gAwa9i-Vrw?t=1216) just because there are causes within the\
[0:20:18](https://youtu.be/7gAwa9i-Vrw?t=1218) universe that the universe itself has a\
[0:20:20](https://youtu.be/7gAwa9i-Vrw?t=1220) cause\
[0:20:21](https://youtu.be/7gAwa9i-Vrw?t=1221) and the atheist can't say just because\
[0:20:23](https://youtu.be/7gAwa9i-Vrw?t=1223) there are causes within the universe\
[0:20:25](https://youtu.be/7gAwa9i-Vrw?t=1225) it doesn't because neither the theist or\
[0:20:27](https://youtu.be/7gAwa9i-Vrw?t=1227) the atheist has what a full knowledge of\
[0:20:30](https://youtu.be/7gAwa9i-Vrw?t=1230) the whole the whole universe thank you\
[0:20:32](https://youtu.be/7gAwa9i-Vrw?t=1232) very much so this\
[0:20:33](https://youtu.be/7gAwa9i-Vrw?t=1233) this is why it's serious because it\
[0:20:35](https://youtu.be/7gAwa9i-Vrw?t=1235) doesn't number one it's not an undercut\
[0:20:37](https://youtu.be/7gAwa9i-Vrw?t=1237) it's not a defeater but it's a blind\
[0:20:40](https://youtu.be/7gAwa9i-Vrw?t=1240) spot\
[0:20:40](https://youtu.be/7gAwa9i-Vrw?t=1240) it is a blind spot it's a it's a blind\
[0:20:44](https://youtu.be/7gAwa9i-Vrw?t=1244) spot\
[0:20:45](https://youtu.be/7gAwa9i-Vrw?t=1245) which has to be covered that's why i\
[0:20:47](https://youtu.be/7gAwa9i-Vrw?t=1247) don't argue from causation\
[0:20:49](https://youtu.be/7gAwa9i-Vrw?t=1249) i this is what even the foil said yeah\
[0:20:51](https://youtu.be/7gAwa9i-Vrw?t=1251) able to file one of the arab\
[0:20:54](https://youtu.be/7gAwa9i-Vrw?t=1254) philosophers he says this and i\
[0:20:56](https://youtu.be/7gAwa9i-Vrw?t=1256) mentioned this in my book actually okay\
[0:20:58](https://youtu.be/7gAwa9i-Vrw?t=1258) cosmological arguments he says you have\
[0:21:00](https://youtu.be/7gAwa9i-Vrw?t=1260) to argue on two tracks\
[0:21:03](https://youtu.be/7gAwa9i-Vrw?t=1263) and what he was talking about two tracks\
[0:21:04](https://youtu.be/7gAwa9i-Vrw?t=1264) is the causation and\
[0:21:06](https://youtu.be/7gAwa9i-Vrw?t=1266) contingency which is necessity\
[0:21:08](https://youtu.be/7gAwa9i-Vrw?t=1268) contingency because when you use both\
[0:21:10](https://youtu.be/7gAwa9i-Vrw?t=1270) it's like when you\
[0:21:10](https://youtu.be/7gAwa9i-Vrw?t=1270) play chess it's not possible i don't\
[0:21:12](https://youtu.be/7gAwa9i-Vrw?t=1272) play chess but for my limited knowledge\
[0:21:14](https://youtu.be/7gAwa9i-Vrw?t=1274) of the game\
[0:21:15](https://youtu.be/7gAwa9i-Vrw?t=1275) it's not possible usually for you to\
[0:21:17](https://youtu.be/7gAwa9i-Vrw?t=1277) finish off the queen unless you have two\
[0:21:18](https://youtu.be/7gAwa9i-Vrw?t=1278) things moving at the same time\
[0:21:20](https://youtu.be/7gAwa9i-Vrw?t=1280) you have to set up the punch in order\
[0:21:22](https://youtu.be/7gAwa9i-Vrw?t=1282) the haymaker in order for it to land\
[0:21:24](https://youtu.be/7gAwa9i-Vrw?t=1284) causation is like i'm happy to use\
[0:21:27](https://youtu.be/7gAwa9i-Vrw?t=1287) causation\
[0:21:28](https://youtu.be/7gAwa9i-Vrw?t=1288) but causation in order to for the the\
[0:21:30](https://youtu.be/7gAwa9i-Vrw?t=1290) argument to be\
[0:21:31](https://youtu.be/7gAwa9i-Vrw?t=1291) an undercutter completely should be\
[0:21:33](https://youtu.be/7gAwa9i-Vrw?t=1293) coupled with contingency\
[0:21:34](https://youtu.be/7gAwa9i-Vrw?t=1294) why because contingency the same thing\
[0:21:37](https://youtu.be/7gAwa9i-Vrw?t=1297) is not\
[0:21:38](https://youtu.be/7gAwa9i-Vrw?t=1298) it's not the same we're not making an\
[0:21:41](https://youtu.be/7gAwa9i-Vrw?t=1301) argument from\
[0:21:41](https://youtu.be/7gAwa9i-Vrw?t=1301) part to whole in fact we're making an\
[0:21:45](https://youtu.be/7gAwa9i-Vrw?t=1305) argument\
[0:21:46](https://youtu.be/7gAwa9i-Vrw?t=1306) that which is called which is actually\
[0:21:49](https://youtu.be/7gAwa9i-Vrw?t=1309) the opposite\
[0:21:50](https://youtu.be/7gAwa9i-Vrw?t=1310) we're saying that anything which is made\
[0:21:51](https://youtu.be/7gAwa9i-Vrw?t=1311) up of anything parts\
[0:21:54](https://youtu.be/7gAwa9i-Vrw?t=1314) anything which is made up of parts is\
[0:21:56](https://youtu.be/7gAwa9i-Vrw?t=1316) dependent\
[0:21:57](https://youtu.be/7gAwa9i-Vrw?t=1317) the universe is made up of parts\
[0:21:58](https://youtu.be/7gAwa9i-Vrw?t=1318) therefore the universe is better\
[0:22:00](https://youtu.be/7gAwa9i-Vrw?t=1320) can you see this so yeah anything which\
[0:22:03](https://youtu.be/7gAwa9i-Vrw?t=1323) is i wouldn't\
[0:22:04](https://youtu.be/7gAwa9i-Vrw?t=1324) we would define parts we're talking\
[0:22:05](https://youtu.be/7gAwa9i-Vrw?t=1325) about something which can be\
[0:22:07](https://youtu.be/7gAwa9i-Vrw?t=1327) assembled and reassembled somebody can\
[0:22:09](https://youtu.be/7gAwa9i-Vrw?t=1329) take in the arcane a pizza\
[0:22:10](https://youtu.be/7gAwa9i-Vrw?t=1330) you take a pizza eat it you slice like\
[0:22:13](https://youtu.be/7gAwa9i-Vrw?t=1333) that anything which is made of the human\
[0:22:15](https://youtu.be/7gAwa9i-Vrw?t=1335) being\
[0:22:16](https://youtu.be/7gAwa9i-Vrw?t=1336) and by the way is in the quran you know\
[0:22:20](https://youtu.be/7gAwa9i-Vrw?t=1340) when allah says you know um\
[0:22:23](https://youtu.be/7gAwa9i-Vrw?t=1343) quebec he's the one who doesn't keep of\
[0:22:26](https://youtu.be/7gAwa9i-Vrw?t=1346) you\
[0:22:28](https://youtu.be/7gAwa9i-Vrw?t=1348) is where you put different parts and you\
[0:22:30](https://youtu.be/7gAwa9i-Vrw?t=1350) put them together now the fact\
[0:22:32](https://youtu.be/7gAwa9i-Vrw?t=1352) that and that something is\
[0:22:35](https://youtu.be/7gAwa9i-Vrw?t=1355) more or in this case composed of\
[0:22:39](https://youtu.be/7gAwa9i-Vrw?t=1359) parts like this shows that there is a\
[0:22:42](https://youtu.be/7gAwa9i-Vrw?t=1362) moroccan\
[0:22:44](https://youtu.be/7gAwa9i-Vrw?t=1364) that there is something which allowed\
[0:22:46](https://youtu.be/7gAwa9i-Vrw?t=1366) these things to be put composed together\
[0:22:48](https://youtu.be/7gAwa9i-Vrw?t=1368) now so we're not arguing from parts to\
[0:22:51](https://youtu.be/7gAwa9i-Vrw?t=1371) holes and in fact we're doing the\
[0:22:52](https://youtu.be/7gAwa9i-Vrw?t=1372) opposite\
[0:22:52](https://youtu.be/7gAwa9i-Vrw?t=1372) we're saying not even arguing from a\
[0:22:54](https://youtu.be/7gAwa9i-Vrw?t=1374) holster parts even where\
[0:22:56](https://youtu.be/7gAwa9i-Vrw?t=1376) we're making one simple observation\
[0:22:59](https://youtu.be/7gAwa9i-Vrw?t=1379) anything that is made up of parts is\
[0:23:01](https://youtu.be/7gAwa9i-Vrw?t=1381) generated\
[0:23:03](https://youtu.be/7gAwa9i-Vrw?t=1383) okay is dependent is dependent dependent\
[0:23:06](https://youtu.be/7gAwa9i-Vrw?t=1386) and or generated and that the universe\
[0:23:09](https://youtu.be/7gAwa9i-Vrw?t=1389) is made up of parts therefore it's\
[0:23:10](https://youtu.be/7gAwa9i-Vrw?t=1390) generated and or depend\
[0:23:12](https://youtu.be/7gAwa9i-Vrw?t=1392) tell us in this case the only way out\
[0:23:15](https://youtu.be/7gAwa9i-Vrw?t=1395) of this is to to claim that the universe\
[0:23:18](https://youtu.be/7gAwa9i-Vrw?t=1398) is not made up of parts\
[0:23:19](https://youtu.be/7gAwa9i-Vrw?t=1399) and that it's not dependent and now you\
[0:23:22](https://youtu.be/7gAwa9i-Vrw?t=1402) have to start providing proofs now the\
[0:23:24](https://youtu.be/7gAwa9i-Vrw?t=1404) burden of proof is upon the person who's\
[0:23:25](https://youtu.be/7gAwa9i-Vrw?t=1405) making the claim\
[0:23:28](https://youtu.be/7gAwa9i-Vrw?t=1408) huh yeah yeah yeah well that's what\
[0:23:30](https://youtu.be/7gAwa9i-Vrw?t=1410) solves the composition fallacy for me\
[0:23:32](https://youtu.be/7gAwa9i-Vrw?t=1412) you argue on you can use this argument\
[0:23:34](https://youtu.be/7gAwa9i-Vrw?t=1414) of gazali yeah\
[0:23:36](https://youtu.be/7gAwa9i-Vrw?t=1416) it's good nice but don't use it by\
[0:23:38](https://youtu.be/7gAwa9i-Vrw?t=1418) itself that's why i use the other one\
[0:23:39](https://youtu.be/7gAwa9i-Vrw?t=1419) because they'll always come with a\
[0:23:40](https://youtu.be/7gAwa9i-Vrw?t=1420) composition fallacy you know\
[0:23:43](https://youtu.be/7gAwa9i-Vrw?t=1423) and both of us have no full answer of\
[0:23:44](https://youtu.be/7gAwa9i-Vrw?t=1424) the whole we can uh yani\
[0:23:46](https://youtu.be/7gAwa9i-Vrw?t=1426) if you wanted to go into metaphysical\
[0:23:48](https://youtu.be/7gAwa9i-Vrw?t=1428) causation ah\
[0:23:49](https://youtu.be/7gAwa9i-Vrw?t=1429) it's a it's a it's a jar with\
[0:23:53](https://youtu.be/7gAwa9i-Vrw?t=1433) worms that you know you don't want to\
[0:23:55](https://youtu.be/7gAwa9i-Vrw?t=1435) open it\
[0:23:56](https://youtu.be/7gAwa9i-Vrw?t=1436) it's seriously it's a long story yeah\
[0:23:59](https://youtu.be/7gAwa9i-Vrw?t=1439) causation there's philosophers have\
[0:24:01](https://youtu.be/7gAwa9i-Vrw?t=1441) spoken about it for a long time you can\
[0:24:02](https://youtu.be/7gAwa9i-Vrw?t=1442) argue of metaphysical causation meaning\
[0:24:04](https://youtu.be/7gAwa9i-Vrw?t=1444) annie\
[0:24:04](https://youtu.be/7gAwa9i-Vrw?t=1444) causation is not physical only you can\
[0:24:07](https://youtu.be/7gAwa9i-Vrw?t=1447) you can argue on a priori grounds and\
[0:24:09](https://youtu.be/7gAwa9i-Vrw?t=1449) that's another way out\
[0:24:10](https://youtu.be/7gAwa9i-Vrw?t=1450) but for that for that to be accessible\
[0:24:12](https://youtu.be/7gAwa9i-Vrw?t=1452) to a lay audience\
[0:24:14](https://youtu.be/7gAwa9i-Vrw?t=1454) that's going to be a challenge in and of\
[0:24:16](https://youtu.be/7gAwa9i-Vrw?t=1456) itself so i\
[0:24:18](https://youtu.be/7gAwa9i-Vrw?t=1458) that's why i like to use the argument\
[0:24:19](https://youtu.be/7gAwa9i-Vrw?t=1459) that i use does that make sense\
[0:24:21](https://youtu.be/7gAwa9i-Vrw?t=1461) yeah it does yeah but what about the the\
[0:24:23](https://youtu.be/7gAwa9i-Vrw?t=1463) fossil because you mentioned the\
[0:24:24](https://youtu.be/7gAwa9i-Vrw?t=1464) opposite of the fallacy of composition\
[0:24:26](https://youtu.be/7gAwa9i-Vrw?t=1466) is the fallacy of division\
[0:24:28](https://youtu.be/7gAwa9i-Vrw?t=1468) yeah but this is not applicable here\
[0:24:31](https://youtu.be/7gAwa9i-Vrw?t=1471) you know why it's not applicable because\
[0:24:32](https://youtu.be/7gAwa9i-Vrw?t=1472) we're not saying that\
[0:24:34](https://youtu.be/7gAwa9i-Vrw?t=1474) we are making a single premise argument\
[0:24:37](https://youtu.be/7gAwa9i-Vrw?t=1477) we're not\
[0:24:38](https://youtu.be/7gAwa9i-Vrw?t=1478) one two three we're saying one thing\
[0:24:40](https://youtu.be/7gAwa9i-Vrw?t=1480) anything which is\
[0:24:41](https://youtu.be/7gAwa9i-Vrw?t=1481) generated sorry anything that is made up\
[0:24:44](https://youtu.be/7gAwa9i-Vrw?t=1484) of parts\
[0:24:44](https://youtu.be/7gAwa9i-Vrw?t=1484) is it generated yeah generated\
[0:24:47](https://youtu.be/7gAwa9i-Vrw?t=1487) that's one and you can have an argument\
[0:24:49](https://youtu.be/7gAwa9i-Vrw?t=1489) with one premise that's my argument\
[0:24:51](https://youtu.be/7gAwa9i-Vrw?t=1491) anything that is made up of parts that\
[0:24:54](https://youtu.be/7gAwa9i-Vrw?t=1494) you can write\
[0:24:55](https://youtu.be/7gAwa9i-Vrw?t=1495) down take out and put in like this is\
[0:24:56](https://youtu.be/7gAwa9i-Vrw?t=1496) what we mean by parts it's\
[0:24:58](https://youtu.be/7gAwa9i-Vrw?t=1498) subject to disassembly if you want to\
[0:25:00](https://youtu.be/7gAwa9i-Vrw?t=1500) call it that you know\
[0:25:01](https://youtu.be/7gAwa9i-Vrw?t=1501) anything that is subject to disassembly\
[0:25:04](https://youtu.be/7gAwa9i-Vrw?t=1504) or additional subtraction\
[0:25:05](https://youtu.be/7gAwa9i-Vrw?t=1505) anything like that that is dependent\
[0:25:08](https://youtu.be/7gAwa9i-Vrw?t=1508) that's\
[0:25:08](https://youtu.be/7gAwa9i-Vrw?t=1508) one observation one premise argument\
[0:25:11](https://youtu.be/7gAwa9i-Vrw?t=1511) and if someone says no it has to be\
[0:25:12](https://youtu.be/7gAwa9i-Vrw?t=1512) three premises who told you that it has\
[0:25:15](https://youtu.be/7gAwa9i-Vrw?t=1515) to be three premises\
[0:25:16](https://youtu.be/7gAwa9i-Vrw?t=1516) that this is uh this actually is not\
[0:25:18](https://youtu.be/7gAwa9i-Vrw?t=1518) correct you can have\
[0:25:20](https://youtu.be/7gAwa9i-Vrw?t=1520) an argument which is a logical argument\
[0:25:22](https://youtu.be/7gAwa9i-Vrw?t=1522) with only one premise\
[0:25:26](https://youtu.be/7gAwa9i-Vrw?t=1526) okay cool okay that was uh\
[0:25:29](https://youtu.be/7gAwa9i-Vrw?t=1529) you know that was it that was it that's\
[0:25:30](https://youtu.be/7gAwa9i-Vrw?t=1530) it brother yusuf before you go\
[0:25:33](https://youtu.be/7gAwa9i-Vrw?t=1533) yes um so jazakallah for joining us on\

[0:25:39](https://youtu.be/7gAwa9i-Vrw?t=1539) very good questions\
[0:25:41](https://youtu.be/7gAwa9i-Vrw?t=1541) and uh these answers i i don't want them\
[0:25:43](https://youtu.be/7gAwa9i-Vrw?t=1543) to be lost on the\
[0:25:45](https://youtu.be/7gAwa9i-Vrw?t=1545) nether regions of the internet so if you\
[0:25:47](https://youtu.be/7gAwa9i-Vrw?t=1547) could\
[0:25:48](https://youtu.be/7gAwa9i-Vrw?t=1548) actually write up the answers that hijab\
[0:25:51](https://youtu.be/7gAwa9i-Vrw?t=1551) gave\
[0:25:52](https://youtu.be/7gAwa9i-Vrw?t=1552) and if because martial you've written\
[0:25:54](https://youtu.be/7gAwa9i-Vrw?t=1554) the other stuff as well\
[0:25:56](https://youtu.be/7gAwa9i-Vrw?t=1556) um in terms of the questions and if you\
[0:25:58](https://youtu.be/7gAwa9i-Vrw?t=1558) could actually post that\
[0:26:00](https://youtu.be/7gAwa9i-Vrw?t=1560) in the comment section so you could just\
[0:26:02](https://youtu.be/7gAwa9i-Vrw?t=1562) if you if you take the time stamp which\
[0:26:03](https://youtu.be/7gAwa9i-Vrw?t=1563) was i think around 16 mark\
[0:26:05](https://youtu.be/7gAwa9i-Vrw?t=1565) when you tried asking and you say by the\
[0:26:07](https://youtu.be/7gAwa9i-Vrw?t=1567) way we discussed this and you and you\
[0:26:09](https://youtu.be/7gAwa9i-Vrw?t=1569) summarized it\
[0:26:10](https://youtu.be/7gAwa9i-Vrw?t=1570) yeah and anybody else that joins us i\
[0:26:12](https://youtu.be/7gAwa9i-Vrw?t=1572) would also say that we don't want just\
[0:26:14](https://youtu.be/7gAwa9i-Vrw?t=1574) this\
[0:26:14](https://youtu.be/7gAwa9i-Vrw?t=1574) information to be you know just floating\
[0:26:16](https://youtu.be/7gAwa9i-Vrw?t=1576) around on the because these live streams\
[0:26:18](https://youtu.be/7gAwa9i-Vrw?t=1578) are quite long\
[0:26:19](https://youtu.be/7gAwa9i-Vrw?t=1579) so i really enjoyed the back and forth\
[0:26:20](https://youtu.be/7gAwa9i-Vrw?t=1580) between you two and there was a lot of\
[0:26:22](https://youtu.be/7gAwa9i-Vrw?t=1582) very novel information there\
[0:26:24](https://youtu.be/7gAwa9i-Vrw?t=1584) so i think this will you know it'll take\
[0:26:25](https://youtu.be/7gAwa9i-Vrw?t=1585) you a bit of time uh maybe half an hour\
[0:26:27](https://youtu.be/7gAwa9i-Vrw?t=1587) something\
[0:26:29](https://youtu.be/7gAwa9i-Vrw?t=1589) i'm willing of course i'm willing yeah\
[0:26:30](https://youtu.be/7gAwa9i-Vrw?t=1590) that's our problem yeah also\
[0:26:32](https://youtu.be/7gAwa9i-Vrw?t=1592) um it would be good if uh what's it\
[0:26:35](https://youtu.be/7gAwa9i-Vrw?t=1595) called\
[0:26:37](https://youtu.be/7gAwa9i-Vrw?t=1597) i'm not sure if you're on twitter or\
[0:26:39](https://youtu.be/7gAwa9i-Vrw?t=1599) whatever if you could\
[0:26:40](https://youtu.be/7gAwa9i-Vrw?t=1600) uh you know tweet that out as well right\
[0:26:44](https://youtu.be/7gAwa9i-Vrw?t=1604) um and just\
[0:26:47](https://youtu.be/7gAwa9i-Vrw?t=1607) do hijab just with the twitter\
[0:26:50](https://youtu.be/7gAwa9i-Vrw?t=1610) what i'm finding and maybe even if you\
[0:26:52](https://youtu.be/7gAwa9i-Vrw?t=1612) take a clip of this video\
[0:26:54](https://youtu.be/7gAwa9i-Vrw?t=1614) and then you just re repost it on\
[0:26:56](https://youtu.be/7gAwa9i-Vrw?t=1616) twitter and stuff\
[0:26:57](https://youtu.be/7gAwa9i-Vrw?t=1617) because some of these things are really\
[0:26:58](https://youtu.be/7gAwa9i-Vrw?t=1618) like you know like we have to sometimes\
[0:27:00](https://youtu.be/7gAwa9i-Vrw?t=1620) repeat them every week as well\
[0:27:02](https://youtu.be/7gAwa9i-Vrw?t=1622) but this thing was this this thing was\
[0:27:04](https://youtu.be/7gAwa9i-Vrw?t=1624) quite unique so i don't want it to be\
[0:27:06](https://youtu.be/7gAwa9i-Vrw?t=1626) lost\
[0:27:08](https://youtu.be/7gAwa9i-Vrw?t=1628) okay thank you uh one last small thing\
[0:27:11](https://youtu.be/7gAwa9i-Vrw?t=1631) uh mohammed hijab i have a message for\
[0:27:13](https://youtu.be/7gAwa9i-Vrw?t=1633) you\
[0:27:14](https://youtu.be/7gAwa9i-Vrw?t=1634) um i have i have a friend of mine\
[0:27:18](https://youtu.be/7gAwa9i-Vrw?t=1638) i was it was kind of like you know\
[0:27:19](https://youtu.be/7gAwa9i-Vrw?t=1639) difficult to like you know\
[0:27:21](https://youtu.be/7gAwa9i-Vrw?t=1641) get him interested in islam\
[0:27:24](https://youtu.be/7gAwa9i-Vrw?t=1644) alhamdulillah you know it happened\
[0:27:25](https://youtu.be/7gAwa9i-Vrw?t=1645) through\
[0:27:26](https://youtu.be/7gAwa9i-Vrw?t=1646) through your videos and through like\
[0:27:27](https://youtu.be/7gAwa9i-Vrw?t=1647) your debates and stuff\
[0:27:29](https://youtu.be/7gAwa9i-Vrw?t=1649) yeah so he loves you he wanted me to\
[0:27:31](https://youtu.be/7gAwa9i-Vrw?t=1651) tell you that send you the message\
[0:27:42](https://youtu.be/7gAwa9i-Vrw?t=1662) okay next we will go to our brother\
[0:27:45](https://youtu.be/7gAwa9i-Vrw?t=1665) and by the way brother yusuf anybody who\
[0:27:47](https://youtu.be/7gAwa9i-Vrw?t=1667) finishes on the live\
[0:27:49](https://youtu.be/7gAwa9i-Vrw?t=1669) i i get them to leave the studio because\
[0:27:51](https://youtu.be/7gAwa9i-Vrw?t=1671) there's lots of people trying to enter\
[0:27:53](https://youtu.be/7gAwa9i-Vrw?t=1673) and emyard only allows us to allow 10\
[0:27:56](https://youtu.be/7gAwa9i-Vrw?t=1676) people to enter a time\
[0:27:57](https://youtu.be/7gAwa9i-Vrw?t=1677) by the way we do a complaint from last\
[0:27:59](https://youtu.be/7gAwa9i-Vrw?t=1679) week's live stream guys\
[0:28:00](https://youtu.be/7gAwa9i-Vrw?t=1680) um so i'm gonna try and reduce\
[0:28:03](https://youtu.be/7gAwa9i-Vrw?t=1683) uh each question into one question so\
[0:28:06](https://youtu.be/7gAwa9i-Vrw?t=1686) that more and more people actually\
[0:28:07](https://youtu.be/7gAwa9i-Vrw?t=1687) interact and then we can recycle as well\
[0:28:09](https://youtu.be/7gAwa9i-Vrw?t=1689) because uh uh we we had that issue that\
[0:28:12](https://youtu.be/7gAwa9i-Vrw?t=1692) a lot of people were waiting we couldn't\
[0:28:14](https://youtu.be/7gAwa9i-Vrw?t=1694) actually get through to them\
[0:28:15](https://youtu.be/7gAwa9i-Vrw?t=1695) so the next is brother janae\
[0:28:18](https://youtu.be/7gAwa9i-Vrw?t=1698) welcome what is your question\
[0:28:25](https://youtu.be/7gAwa9i-Vrw?t=1705) um yeah my question sorry just before\
[0:28:28](https://youtu.be/7gAwa9i-Vrw?t=1708) i'll get to my question just on that\
[0:28:30](https://youtu.be/7gAwa9i-Vrw?t=1710) the point of causation couldn't you also\
[0:28:33](https://youtu.be/7gAwa9i-Vrw?t=1713) oh can you hear me\
[0:28:34](https://youtu.be/7gAwa9i-Vrw?t=1714) yes yeah yeah we're here oh something\
[0:28:36](https://youtu.be/7gAwa9i-Vrw?t=1716) happened okay\
[0:28:37](https://youtu.be/7gAwa9i-Vrw?t=1717) can you also just argue i think you\
[0:28:39](https://youtu.be/7gAwa9i-Vrw?t=1719) mentioned it by saying the a priority\
[0:28:41](https://youtu.be/7gAwa9i-Vrw?t=1721) thing\
[0:28:42](https://youtu.be/7gAwa9i-Vrw?t=1722) that well all of our knowledge is or\
[0:28:44](https://youtu.be/7gAwa9i-Vrw?t=1724) like yani\
[0:28:45](https://youtu.be/7gAwa9i-Vrw?t=1725) as in we only get our knowledge by\
[0:28:46](https://youtu.be/7gAwa9i-Vrw?t=1726) whether you're gonna argue\
[0:28:48](https://youtu.be/7gAwa9i-Vrw?t=1728) um rationality experience intuition\
[0:28:50](https://youtu.be/7gAwa9i-Vrw?t=1730) whatever\
[0:28:51](https://youtu.be/7gAwa9i-Vrw?t=1731) so on that basis we see the universe\
[0:28:54](https://youtu.be/7gAwa9i-Vrw?t=1734) around us everything has causation\
[0:28:56](https://youtu.be/7gAwa9i-Vrw?t=1736) so from our experience then um the most\
[0:28:59](https://youtu.be/7gAwa9i-Vrw?t=1739) rational argument that we can possibly\
[0:29:01](https://youtu.be/7gAwa9i-Vrw?t=1741) make\
[0:29:01](https://youtu.be/7gAwa9i-Vrw?t=1741) is assume that causation also happens\
[0:29:04](https://youtu.be/7gAwa9i-Vrw?t=1744) there because\
[0:29:05](https://youtu.be/7gAwa9i-Vrw?t=1745) even if it's not that's a fine argument\
[0:29:07](https://youtu.be/7gAwa9i-Vrw?t=1747) in my opinion and that's a\
[0:29:08](https://youtu.be/7gAwa9i-Vrw?t=1748) great argument uh the reason why i do\
[0:29:11](https://youtu.be/7gAwa9i-Vrw?t=1751) the argument the way i do it\
[0:29:12](https://youtu.be/7gAwa9i-Vrw?t=1752) you can add that to it is because it\
[0:29:14](https://youtu.be/7gAwa9i-Vrw?t=1754) just leaves no space for that\
[0:29:16](https://youtu.be/7gAwa9i-Vrw?t=1756) like but yeah that there's a fine\
[0:29:18](https://youtu.be/7gAwa9i-Vrw?t=1758) argument and\
[0:29:20](https://youtu.be/7gAwa9i-Vrw?t=1760) what i think is good is if you use\
[0:29:21](https://youtu.be/7gAwa9i-Vrw?t=1761) mathematics or something which is\
[0:29:23](https://youtu.be/7gAwa9i-Vrw?t=1763) like clearly out of the realm of the\
[0:29:26](https://youtu.be/7gAwa9i-Vrw?t=1766) empirical\
[0:29:26](https://youtu.be/7gAwa9i-Vrw?t=1766) right out of the wrong and show that is\
[0:29:28](https://youtu.be/7gAwa9i-Vrw?t=1768) there is there no causation going on\
[0:29:30](https://youtu.be/7gAwa9i-Vrw?t=1770) here this\
[0:29:31](https://youtu.be/7gAwa9i-Vrw?t=1771) like for example even logical arguments\
[0:29:33](https://youtu.be/7gAwa9i-Vrw?t=1773) themselves you know\
[0:29:35](https://youtu.be/7gAwa9i-Vrw?t=1775) something causes something else or you\
[0:29:37](https://youtu.be/7gAwa9i-Vrw?t=1777) know there are so many things that are\
[0:29:39](https://youtu.be/7gAwa9i-Vrw?t=1779) happening\
[0:29:40](https://youtu.be/7gAwa9i-Vrw?t=1780) which you can you can argue for a priori\
[0:29:42](https://youtu.be/7gAwa9i-Vrw?t=1782) um causation\
[0:29:43](https://youtu.be/7gAwa9i-Vrw?t=1783) and for sure there's a lot of stuff that\
[0:29:46](https://youtu.be/7gAwa9i-Vrw?t=1786) has been written it's back and forth on\
[0:29:47](https://youtu.be/7gAwa9i-Vrw?t=1787) it\
[0:29:48](https://youtu.be/7gAwa9i-Vrw?t=1788) but because there's some some degree of\
[0:29:51](https://youtu.be/7gAwa9i-Vrw?t=1791) philosophical controversy okay\
[0:29:54](https://youtu.be/7gAwa9i-Vrw?t=1794) that's why i i always try and find under\
[0:29:57](https://youtu.be/7gAwa9i-Vrw?t=1797) cutters\
[0:29:57](https://youtu.be/7gAwa9i-Vrw?t=1797) yeah i need something which no one can\
[0:30:00](https://youtu.be/7gAwa9i-Vrw?t=1800) come back from\
[0:30:01](https://youtu.be/7gAwa9i-Vrw?t=1801) yeah oh you can you can throw that in\
[0:30:03](https://youtu.be/7gAwa9i-Vrw?t=1803) there for sure\
[0:30:05](https://youtu.be/7gAwa9i-Vrw?t=1805) yeah you know i get that okay so\
[0:30:07](https://youtu.be/7gAwa9i-Vrw?t=1807) basically\
[0:30:08](https://youtu.be/7gAwa9i-Vrw?t=1808) my question yeah so i kind of have two\
[0:30:10](https://youtu.be/7gAwa9i-Vrw?t=1810) questions but we'll see how it goes so\
[0:30:11](https://youtu.be/7gAwa9i-Vrw?t=1811) the first one is\
[0:30:12](https://youtu.be/7gAwa9i-Vrw?t=1812) basically to do with um uh the idea of\
[0:30:15](https://youtu.be/7gAwa9i-Vrw?t=1815) um like a logical contradiction right\
[0:30:18](https://youtu.be/7gAwa9i-Vrw?t=1818) so is it that like um\
[0:30:23](https://youtu.be/7gAwa9i-Vrw?t=1823) uh i do we as muslims basically believe\
[0:30:26](https://youtu.be/7gAwa9i-Vrw?t=1826) that uh if something's a logical\
[0:30:28](https://youtu.be/7gAwa9i-Vrw?t=1828) contradiction in this realm\
[0:30:30](https://youtu.be/7gAwa9i-Vrw?t=1830) in this world it will be a logical\
[0:30:31](https://youtu.be/7gAwa9i-Vrw?t=1831) contradiction everywhere like\
[0:30:33](https://youtu.be/7gAwa9i-Vrw?t=1833) nothing can be and not be at the same\
[0:30:36](https://youtu.be/7gAwa9i-Vrw?t=1836) time that's everywhere\
[0:30:37](https://youtu.be/7gAwa9i-Vrw?t=1837) that that's just you can just say yes or\
[0:30:39](https://youtu.be/7gAwa9i-Vrw?t=1839) no and i'll add to that\
[0:30:43](https://youtu.be/7gAwa9i-Vrw?t=1843) now it depends on how you define a\
[0:30:44](https://youtu.be/7gAwa9i-Vrw?t=1844) logical contradiction if you're talking\
[0:30:46](https://youtu.be/7gAwa9i-Vrw?t=1846) about\
[0:30:46](https://youtu.be/7gAwa9i-Vrw?t=1846) \[Music]\
[0:30:48](https://youtu.be/7gAwa9i-Vrw?t=1848) if you're talking about textbook logical\
[0:30:49](https://youtu.be/7gAwa9i-Vrw?t=1849) definitions then yes this is the case\
[0:30:51](https://youtu.be/7gAwa9i-Vrw?t=1851) because a thing is defined as by\
[0:30:54](https://youtu.be/7gAwa9i-Vrw?t=1854) definition\
[0:30:56](https://youtu.be/7gAwa9i-Vrw?t=1856) that which can conceivably exist so for\
[0:30:59](https://youtu.be/7gAwa9i-Vrw?t=1859) example a square triangle can\
[0:31:01](https://youtu.be/7gAwa9i-Vrw?t=1861) there's no possible world in which a\
[0:31:03](https://youtu.be/7gAwa9i-Vrw?t=1863) square\
[0:31:04](https://youtu.be/7gAwa9i-Vrw?t=1864) squared triangle or triangle squared\
[0:31:07](https://youtu.be/7gAwa9i-Vrw?t=1867) can never exist it cannot exist because\
[0:31:09](https://youtu.be/7gAwa9i-Vrw?t=1869) of its uh\
[0:31:10](https://youtu.be/7gAwa9i-Vrw?t=1870) impossibility yeah it's not a thing\
[0:31:14](https://youtu.be/7gAwa9i-Vrw?t=1874) yeah okay so then on that then um\
[0:31:17](https://youtu.be/7gAwa9i-Vrw?t=1877) couldn't someone argue\
[0:31:20](https://youtu.be/7gAwa9i-Vrw?t=1880) like for example let's say on the debate\
[0:31:23](https://youtu.be/7gAwa9i-Vrw?t=1883) kind of thing right\
[0:31:24](https://youtu.be/7gAwa9i-Vrw?t=1884) um if if we respond to the god of debate\
[0:31:26](https://youtu.be/7gAwa9i-Vrw?t=1886) we say okay look this is from god's\
[0:31:27](https://youtu.be/7gAwa9i-Vrw?t=1887) attributes\
[0:31:28](https://youtu.be/7gAwa9i-Vrw?t=1888) yeah uh he predestines and he gives us\
[0:31:31](https://youtu.be/7gAwa9i-Vrw?t=1891) free will\
[0:31:32](https://youtu.be/7gAwa9i-Vrw?t=1892) and since it's in god's realm we can't\
[0:31:34](https://youtu.be/7gAwa9i-Vrw?t=1894) understand it\
[0:31:35](https://youtu.be/7gAwa9i-Vrw?t=1895) but it's not for us to you know any pick\
[0:31:37](https://youtu.be/7gAwa9i-Vrw?t=1897) and choose what what he has to tell us\
[0:31:39](https://youtu.be/7gAwa9i-Vrw?t=1899) so if he tells us it's true but then\
[0:31:42](https://youtu.be/7gAwa9i-Vrw?t=1902) couldn't\
[0:31:42](https://youtu.be/7gAwa9i-Vrw?t=1902) someone argue okay but even if it's even\
[0:31:45](https://youtu.be/7gAwa9i-Vrw?t=1905) if god's in some other realm\
[0:31:49](https://youtu.be/7gAwa9i-Vrw?t=1909) predestination and free will that's a\
[0:31:51](https://youtu.be/7gAwa9i-Vrw?t=1911) open kind of contradiction\
[0:31:53](https://youtu.be/7gAwa9i-Vrw?t=1913) so it's a logical contradiction so it\
[0:31:54](https://youtu.be/7gAwa9i-Vrw?t=1914) can't be possible in any possible world\
[0:31:57](https://youtu.be/7gAwa9i-Vrw?t=1917) yeah i don't think that can be argued\
[0:31:59](https://youtu.be/7gAwa9i-Vrw?t=1919) like that um\
[0:32:00](https://youtu.be/7gAwa9i-Vrw?t=1920) the reason why i first of all if that\
[0:32:02](https://youtu.be/7gAwa9i-Vrw?t=1922) was so simple then there would not be\
[0:32:05](https://youtu.be/7gAwa9i-Vrw?t=1925) this huge school of thought called the\
[0:32:06](https://youtu.be/7gAwa9i-Vrw?t=1926) compatibilists first of all\
[0:32:08](https://youtu.be/7gAwa9i-Vrw?t=1928) right because the compatibilists which\
[0:32:11](https://youtu.be/7gAwa9i-Vrw?t=1931) range from thomas hobbs\
[0:32:13](https://youtu.be/7gAwa9i-Vrw?t=1933) and go all the way to john mill john\
[0:32:15](https://youtu.be/7gAwa9i-Vrw?t=1935) stuart mill\
[0:32:16](https://youtu.be/7gAwa9i-Vrw?t=1936) and all of those in between and i think\
[0:32:18](https://youtu.be/7gAwa9i-Vrw?t=1938) if you do a probably a count\
[0:32:20](https://youtu.be/7gAwa9i-Vrw?t=1940) philosophy count in the secular world of\
[0:32:23](https://youtu.be/7gAwa9i-Vrw?t=1943) uh\
[0:32:23](https://youtu.be/7gAwa9i-Vrw?t=1943) compatibility it's probably the largest\
[0:32:25](https://youtu.be/7gAwa9i-Vrw?t=1945) school of thought of the three a\
[0:32:26](https://youtu.be/7gAwa9i-Vrw?t=1946) libertarian\
[0:32:27](https://youtu.be/7gAwa9i-Vrw?t=1947) compatibilist and determinist but do\
[0:32:30](https://youtu.be/7gAwa9i-Vrw?t=1950) they believe like sorry just quickly\
[0:32:31](https://youtu.be/7gAwa9i-Vrw?t=1951) in terms of compatibility i know they\
[0:32:33](https://youtu.be/7gAwa9i-Vrw?t=1953) may believe what's it called that\
[0:32:35](https://youtu.be/7gAwa9i-Vrw?t=1955) everything and it can be known\
[0:32:36](https://youtu.be/7gAwa9i-Vrw?t=1956) beforehand but do they believe that\
[0:32:37](https://youtu.be/7gAwa9i-Vrw?t=1957) everything is literally decreed\
[0:32:39](https://youtu.be/7gAwa9i-Vrw?t=1959) and also you can have that tweet the way\
[0:32:42](https://youtu.be/7gAwa9i-Vrw?t=1962) that the\
[0:32:43](https://youtu.be/7gAwa9i-Vrw?t=1963) the they would frame it they wouldn't\
[0:32:44](https://youtu.be/7gAwa9i-Vrw?t=1964) use what decreed they would they would\
[0:32:46](https://youtu.be/7gAwa9i-Vrw?t=1966) just say that there is an uninterrupted\
[0:32:47](https://youtu.be/7gAwa9i-Vrw?t=1967) causal chain of events\
[0:32:49](https://youtu.be/7gAwa9i-Vrw?t=1969) which renders everything that happens\
[0:32:52](https://youtu.be/7gAwa9i-Vrw?t=1972) as necessarily happening because of that\
[0:32:55](https://youtu.be/7gAwa9i-Vrw?t=1975) change so in other words\
[0:32:56](https://youtu.be/7gAwa9i-Vrw?t=1976) everything that i'm saying right now\
[0:32:58](https://youtu.be/7gAwa9i-Vrw?t=1978) everything that i'm doing\
[0:32:59](https://youtu.be/7gAwa9i-Vrw?t=1979) is happening because of this\
[0:33:01](https://youtu.be/7gAwa9i-Vrw?t=1981) uninterrupted chain of causal events\
[0:33:04](https://youtu.be/7gAwa9i-Vrw?t=1984) atheists believe in this by the way like\
[0:33:05](https://youtu.be/7gAwa9i-Vrw?t=1985) sam harris has a book\
[0:33:08](https://youtu.be/7gAwa9i-Vrw?t=1988) on it so this is what they say\
[0:33:11](https://youtu.be/7gAwa9i-Vrw?t=1991) everything i'm saying\
[0:33:12](https://youtu.be/7gAwa9i-Vrw?t=1992) in fact everything i'm thinking not just\
[0:33:13](https://youtu.be/7gAwa9i-Vrw?t=1993) about everything i'm saying is as a\
[0:33:15](https://youtu.be/7gAwa9i-Vrw?t=1995) result of the uninterrupted causal like\
[0:33:18](https://youtu.be/7gAwa9i-Vrw?t=1998) something happened before this and\
[0:33:19](https://youtu.be/7gAwa9i-Vrw?t=1999) something happened before that and\
[0:33:20](https://youtu.be/7gAwa9i-Vrw?t=2000) something happened before that\
[0:33:21](https://youtu.be/7gAwa9i-Vrw?t=2001) and these dominoes caused me to do and\
[0:33:23](https://youtu.be/7gAwa9i-Vrw?t=2003) say what's happening right now and what\
[0:33:25](https://youtu.be/7gAwa9i-Vrw?t=2005) i'm saying right now\
[0:33:26](https://youtu.be/7gAwa9i-Vrw?t=2006) the problem that these people face is\
[0:33:28](https://youtu.be/7gAwa9i-Vrw?t=2008) intuition okay the immediate knowledge\
[0:33:30](https://youtu.be/7gAwa9i-Vrw?t=2010) of me\
[0:33:31](https://youtu.be/7gAwa9i-Vrw?t=2011) having the first person experience which\
[0:33:34](https://youtu.be/7gAwa9i-Vrw?t=2014) is undeniable to me which is that i have\
[0:33:36](https://youtu.be/7gAwa9i-Vrw?t=2016) volition\
[0:33:37](https://youtu.be/7gAwa9i-Vrw?t=2017) okay now for for anyone to deny that\
[0:33:40](https://youtu.be/7gAwa9i-Vrw?t=2020) that i have that\
[0:33:41](https://youtu.be/7gAwa9i-Vrw?t=2021) is tantamount to almost denying one's\
[0:33:44](https://youtu.be/7gAwa9i-Vrw?t=2024) exist owns existence\
[0:33:45](https://youtu.be/7gAwa9i-Vrw?t=2025) it's it's impossible for one to falsify\
[0:33:48](https://youtu.be/7gAwa9i-Vrw?t=2028) that\
[0:33:48](https://youtu.be/7gAwa9i-Vrw?t=2028) and epistemologically it's you could\
[0:33:51](https://youtu.be/7gAwa9i-Vrw?t=2031) argue even more powerful some have\
[0:33:52](https://youtu.be/7gAwa9i-Vrw?t=2032) argued more powerful than\
[0:33:54](https://youtu.be/7gAwa9i-Vrw?t=2034) the demonstrative method you could argue\
[0:33:56](https://youtu.be/7gAwa9i-Vrw?t=2036) these things so you have these two\
[0:33:57](https://youtu.be/7gAwa9i-Vrw?t=2037) things which on their\
[0:33:59](https://youtu.be/7gAwa9i-Vrw?t=2039) world view are almost impossible to\
[0:34:02](https://youtu.be/7gAwa9i-Vrw?t=2042) refute\
[0:34:03](https://youtu.be/7gAwa9i-Vrw?t=2043) number one is the uninterrupted causal\
[0:34:06](https://youtu.be/7gAwa9i-Vrw?t=2046) line\
[0:34:06](https://youtu.be/7gAwa9i-Vrw?t=2046) of things that have happened before what\
[0:34:08](https://youtu.be/7gAwa9i-Vrw?t=2048) i'm saying now has happened\
[0:34:10](https://youtu.be/7gAwa9i-Vrw?t=2050) and number two the immediate knowledge\
[0:34:12](https://youtu.be/7gAwa9i-Vrw?t=2052) that i have of volition\
[0:34:15](https://youtu.be/7gAwa9i-Vrw?t=2055) and these two things have to somehow\
[0:34:17](https://youtu.be/7gAwa9i-Vrw?t=2057) exist together\
[0:34:18](https://youtu.be/7gAwa9i-Vrw?t=2058) the mechanism of them existing together\
[0:34:21](https://youtu.be/7gAwa9i-Vrw?t=2061) is unknown\
[0:34:22](https://youtu.be/7gAwa9i-Vrw?t=2062) but then to say that it's a\
[0:34:24](https://youtu.be/7gAwa9i-Vrw?t=2064) contradiction is equivalent to going to\
[0:34:26](https://youtu.be/7gAwa9i-Vrw?t=2066) quantum physics and saying well we don't\
[0:34:28](https://youtu.be/7gAwa9i-Vrw?t=2068) understand how two particles can be in\
[0:34:30](https://youtu.be/7gAwa9i-Vrw?t=2070) one place at the same time\
[0:34:32](https://youtu.be/7gAwa9i-Vrw?t=2072) and therefore it's a contradiction it's\
[0:34:33](https://youtu.be/7gAwa9i-Vrw?t=2073) a contradiction because we're using\
[0:34:36](https://youtu.be/7gAwa9i-Vrw?t=2076) uh different paradigms for different\
[0:34:38](https://youtu.be/7gAwa9i-Vrw?t=2078) things\
[0:34:39](https://youtu.be/7gAwa9i-Vrw?t=2079) in this case we are talking about\
[0:34:42](https://youtu.be/7gAwa9i-Vrw?t=2082) something\
[0:34:42](https://youtu.be/7gAwa9i-Vrw?t=2082) which we don't actually have knowledge\
[0:34:44](https://youtu.be/7gAwa9i-Vrw?t=2084) of the mechanism of\
[0:34:46](https://youtu.be/7gAwa9i-Vrw?t=2086) so we're saying that it has to be the\
[0:34:48](https://youtu.be/7gAwa9i-Vrw?t=2088) case one and two have to be the case but\
[0:34:51](https://youtu.be/7gAwa9i-Vrw?t=2091) how the howellness is to be honest with\
[0:34:53](https://youtu.be/7gAwa9i-Vrw?t=2093) you no compatibilist\
[0:34:55](https://youtu.be/7gAwa9i-Vrw?t=2095) within any school of thought that i've\
[0:34:57](https://youtu.be/7gAwa9i-Vrw?t=2097) seen have given me a really\
[0:34:59](https://youtu.be/7gAwa9i-Vrw?t=2099) robust definition of how the two things\
[0:35:00](https://youtu.be/7gAwa9i-Vrw?t=2100) can happen at the same time\
[0:35:02](https://youtu.be/7gAwa9i-Vrw?t=2102) so i would say that just because we have\
[0:35:04](https://youtu.be/7gAwa9i-Vrw?t=2104) to suspend judgment on the wholeness of\
[0:35:06](https://youtu.be/7gAwa9i-Vrw?t=2106) how these two things happen at the same\
[0:35:08](https://youtu.be/7gAwa9i-Vrw?t=2108) time it doesn't mean to say now that the\
[0:35:10](https://youtu.be/7gAwa9i-Vrw?t=2110) two things are not happening at the same\
[0:35:11](https://youtu.be/7gAwa9i-Vrw?t=2111) time\
[0:35:12](https://youtu.be/7gAwa9i-Vrw?t=2112) you know and so the the fact that you\
[0:35:16](https://youtu.be/7gAwa9i-Vrw?t=2116) can dump\
[0:35:17](https://youtu.be/7gAwa9i-Vrw?t=2117) demonstrate both of those things free\
[0:35:19](https://youtu.be/7gAwa9i-Vrw?t=2119) will and determinism\
[0:35:21](https://youtu.be/7gAwa9i-Vrw?t=2121) okay it's not an evidence against either\
[0:35:23](https://youtu.be/7gAwa9i-Vrw?t=2123) of them\
[0:35:24](https://youtu.be/7gAwa9i-Vrw?t=2124) uh number one and number two the fact\
[0:35:27](https://youtu.be/7gAwa9i-Vrw?t=2127) that we can't explain mechanisms\
[0:35:29](https://youtu.be/7gAwa9i-Vrw?t=2129) of their equal existence or coexistence\
[0:35:34](https://youtu.be/7gAwa9i-Vrw?t=2134) or symbiotic existence it's not an\
[0:35:36](https://youtu.be/7gAwa9i-Vrw?t=2136) evidence that\
[0:35:37](https://youtu.be/7gAwa9i-Vrw?t=2137) that such symbiotic existence is not\
[0:35:39](https://youtu.be/7gAwa9i-Vrw?t=2139) happening\
[0:35:40](https://youtu.be/7gAwa9i-Vrw?t=2140) so if you wanted to mechanically write\
[0:35:42](https://youtu.be/7gAwa9i-Vrw?t=2142) down how is this happening is\
[0:35:44](https://youtu.be/7gAwa9i-Vrw?t=2144) the k fear the how the on the honest\
[0:35:46](https://youtu.be/7gAwa9i-Vrw?t=2146) truth is no one knows how\
[0:35:48](https://youtu.be/7gAwa9i-Vrw?t=2148) but if if we would be in a problem if we\
[0:35:51](https://youtu.be/7gAwa9i-Vrw?t=2151) couldn't demonstrate either of the two\
[0:35:52](https://youtu.be/7gAwa9i-Vrw?t=2152) things\
[0:35:53](https://youtu.be/7gAwa9i-Vrw?t=2153) like if we couldn't demonstrate the fact\
[0:35:55](https://youtu.be/7gAwa9i-Vrw?t=2155) that there is an uninterrupted causal\
[0:35:56](https://youtu.be/7gAwa9i-Vrw?t=2156) line\
[0:35:57](https://youtu.be/7gAwa9i-Vrw?t=2157) which we believe comes from allah they\
[0:36:00](https://youtu.be/7gAwa9i-Vrw?t=2160) believe there's an infinite regress or\
[0:36:01](https://youtu.be/7gAwa9i-Vrw?t=2161) whatever they want to say\
[0:36:02](https://youtu.be/7gAwa9i-Vrw?t=2162) or we couldn't demonstrate that we have\
[0:36:04](https://youtu.be/7gAwa9i-Vrw?t=2164) volition okay\
[0:36:06](https://youtu.be/7gAwa9i-Vrw?t=2166) then we'd have some problems but we can\
[0:36:08](https://youtu.be/7gAwa9i-Vrw?t=2168) demonstrate both of those things but not\
[0:36:10](https://youtu.be/7gAwa9i-Vrw?t=2170) how they\
[0:36:11](https://youtu.be/7gAwa9i-Vrw?t=2171) symbiotically uh mechanically\
[0:36:14](https://youtu.be/7gAwa9i-Vrw?t=2174) uh interact with one another and this is\
[0:36:17](https://youtu.be/7gAwa9i-Vrw?t=2177) the mystery of\
[0:36:19](https://youtu.be/7gAwa9i-Vrw?t=2179) that that's right so to call it a\
[0:36:20](https://youtu.be/7gAwa9i-Vrw?t=2180) contradiction because you don't know how\
[0:36:22](https://youtu.be/7gAwa9i-Vrw?t=2182) it interacts with her\
[0:36:23](https://youtu.be/7gAwa9i-Vrw?t=2183) it's almost equivalent to calling\
[0:36:26](https://youtu.be/7gAwa9i-Vrw?t=2186) um you know something of quantum physics\
[0:36:29](https://youtu.be/7gAwa9i-Vrw?t=2189) uh contradiction\
[0:36:30](https://youtu.be/7gAwa9i-Vrw?t=2190) yeah um so then on that point then\
[0:36:32](https://youtu.be/7gAwa9i-Vrw?t=2192) wouldn't the\
[0:36:33](https://youtu.be/7gAwa9i-Vrw?t=2193) like a response be that well well how do\
[0:36:36](https://youtu.be/7gAwa9i-Vrw?t=2196) you know that something's like a\
[0:36:38](https://youtu.be/7gAwa9i-Vrw?t=2198) uh so true by intuition that you know\
[0:36:40](https://youtu.be/7gAwa9i-Vrw?t=2200) and you must be true because for you\
[0:36:42](https://youtu.be/7gAwa9i-Vrw?t=2202) it might be that okay i definitely have\
[0:36:44](https://youtu.be/7gAwa9i-Vrw?t=2204) free will that's intuitive but someone\
[0:36:45](https://youtu.be/7gAwa9i-Vrw?t=2205) else\
[0:36:46](https://youtu.be/7gAwa9i-Vrw?t=2206) it's intuitive that you know this like\
[0:36:48](https://youtu.be/7gAwa9i-Vrw?t=2208) they'll they'll say okay it's intuitive\
[0:36:51](https://youtu.be/7gAwa9i-Vrw?t=2211) look honestly this is something which\
[0:36:53](https://youtu.be/7gAwa9i-Vrw?t=2213) almost everyone agrees because\
[0:36:55](https://youtu.be/7gAwa9i-Vrw?t=2215) uh moral the whole justice system is\
[0:36:58](https://youtu.be/7gAwa9i-Vrw?t=2218) based on this assumption okay there\
[0:37:01](https://youtu.be/7gAwa9i-Vrw?t=2221) would be no courts\
[0:37:03](https://youtu.be/7gAwa9i-Vrw?t=2223) if we were not responsible for our own\
[0:37:04](https://youtu.be/7gAwa9i-Vrw?t=2224) actions that's this was the argument of\
[0:37:07](https://youtu.be/7gAwa9i-Vrw?t=2227) the liberals and that's why they made\
[0:37:08](https://youtu.be/7gAwa9i-Vrw?t=2228) their point to mention this you know\
[0:37:10](https://youtu.be/7gAwa9i-Vrw?t=2230) there would be no blame on anyone\
[0:37:13](https://youtu.be/7gAwa9i-Vrw?t=2233) like you know what sam harris makes his\
[0:37:15](https://youtu.be/7gAwa9i-Vrw?t=2235) moral arguments for example he makes uh\
[0:37:17](https://youtu.be/7gAwa9i-Vrw?t=2237) and those who follow him and other\
[0:37:18](https://youtu.be/7gAwa9i-Vrw?t=2238) terminus like him\
[0:37:20](https://youtu.be/7gAwa9i-Vrw?t=2240) they say this person was so bad to me\
[0:37:22](https://youtu.be/7gAwa9i-Vrw?t=2242) you know this person was that this\
[0:37:23](https://youtu.be/7gAwa9i-Vrw?t=2243) person's so horrible\
[0:37:24](https://youtu.be/7gAwa9i-Vrw?t=2244) religion is so bad why are you making\
[0:37:25](https://youtu.be/7gAwa9i-Vrw?t=2245) all these arguments yeah these people\
[0:37:27](https://youtu.be/7gAwa9i-Vrw?t=2247) are not responsible for their actions\
[0:37:29](https://youtu.be/7gAwa9i-Vrw?t=2249) on your worldview with one\
[0:37:32](https://youtu.be/7gAwa9i-Vrw?t=2252) a young man in oxford university young\
[0:37:35](https://youtu.be/7gAwa9i-Vrw?t=2255) park who keeps changing his mind on\
[0:37:36](https://youtu.be/7gAwa9i-Vrw?t=2256) certain opinions\
[0:37:38](https://youtu.be/7gAwa9i-Vrw?t=2258) and he keeps you know complaining about\
[0:37:40](https://youtu.be/7gAwa9i-Vrw?t=2260) how my behavior is\
[0:37:42](https://youtu.be/7gAwa9i-Vrw?t=2262) he makes video here with the video\
[0:37:43](https://youtu.be/7gAwa9i-Vrw?t=2263) they're upset about this you know\
[0:37:44](https://youtu.be/7gAwa9i-Vrw?t=2264) triggered and i'm standing back him up\
[0:37:47](https://youtu.be/7gAwa9i-Vrw?t=2267) you know cut him off and you know it's\
[0:37:50](https://youtu.be/7gAwa9i-Vrw?t=2270) obviously there's some kind of\
[0:37:52](https://youtu.be/7gAwa9i-Vrw?t=2272) looking up to me and stuff like that\
[0:37:53](https://youtu.be/7gAwa9i-Vrw?t=2273) it's very natural stuff no problem\
[0:37:55](https://youtu.be/7gAwa9i-Vrw?t=2275) but you know he makes this video saying\
[0:37:58](https://youtu.be/7gAwa9i-Vrw?t=2278) he done this and he recited the quran\
[0:38:00](https://youtu.be/7gAwa9i-Vrw?t=2280) like that and\
[0:38:00](https://youtu.be/7gAwa9i-Vrw?t=2280) whatever whatever the complaints he had\
[0:38:03](https://youtu.be/7gAwa9i-Vrw?t=2283) why are you blaming me if you're a\
[0:38:04](https://youtu.be/7gAwa9i-Vrw?t=2284) determinist\
[0:38:05](https://youtu.be/7gAwa9i-Vrw?t=2285) you should blame the uninterrupted\
[0:38:07](https://youtu.be/7gAwa9i-Vrw?t=2287) causal line of events\
[0:38:08](https://youtu.be/7gAwa9i-Vrw?t=2288) which caused me to do these things for\
[0:38:11](https://youtu.be/7gAwa9i-Vrw?t=2291) no cause of my own no plan of mind and\
[0:38:12](https://youtu.be/7gAwa9i-Vrw?t=2292) do this\
[0:38:13](https://youtu.be/7gAwa9i-Vrw?t=2293) it was the uninterrupted causal line sam\
[0:38:16](https://youtu.be/7gAwa9i-Vrw?t=2296) harris\
[0:38:16](https://youtu.be/7gAwa9i-Vrw?t=2296) uh ifrazie one time he said it's very\
[0:38:18](https://youtu.be/7gAwa9i-Vrw?t=2298) interesting or like he said sam harris\
[0:38:20](https://youtu.be/7gAwa9i-Vrw?t=2300) wrote a book\
[0:38:21](https://youtu.be/7gAwa9i-Vrw?t=2301) called what's it called the free will is\
[0:38:22](https://youtu.be/7gAwa9i-Vrw?t=2302) it called free will waking up\
[0:38:26](https://youtu.be/7gAwa9i-Vrw?t=2306) his book on the determinism one not the\
[0:38:28](https://youtu.be/7gAwa9i-Vrw?t=2308) moral landscape the free will one or he\
[0:38:30](https://youtu.be/7gAwa9i-Vrw?t=2310) talks about free will\
[0:38:31](https://youtu.be/7gAwa9i-Vrw?t=2311) and at the bottom of it he wrote sam\
[0:38:33](https://youtu.be/7gAwa9i-Vrw?t=2313) harris\
[0:38:34](https://youtu.be/7gAwa9i-Vrw?t=2314) why are you why are you taking\
[0:38:36](https://youtu.be/7gAwa9i-Vrw?t=2316) responsibility for the book\
[0:38:38](https://youtu.be/7gAwa9i-Vrw?t=2318) you know when actually it was an\
[0:38:40](https://youtu.be/7gAwa9i-Vrw?t=2320) uninterrupted cause of line that which\
[0:38:42](https://youtu.be/7gAwa9i-Vrw?t=2322) yeah you had no say in the matter it was\
[0:38:44](https://youtu.be/7gAwa9i-Vrw?t=2324) you being forced in a sense\
[0:38:46](https://youtu.be/7gAwa9i-Vrw?t=2326) into compulsion and necessity to write\
[0:38:48](https://youtu.be/7gAwa9i-Vrw?t=2328) the book\
[0:38:49](https://youtu.be/7gAwa9i-Vrw?t=2329) why i don't understand why i determine\
[0:38:51](https://youtu.be/7gAwa9i-Vrw?t=2331) this is the worst\
[0:38:52](https://youtu.be/7gAwa9i-Vrw?t=2332) kind of contradiction i don't understand\
[0:38:55](https://youtu.be/7gAwa9i-Vrw?t=2335) why determinist\
[0:38:56](https://youtu.be/7gAwa9i-Vrw?t=2336) atheists who do not believe human free\
[0:38:59](https://youtu.be/7gAwa9i-Vrw?t=2339) will\
[0:39:00](https://youtu.be/7gAwa9i-Vrw?t=2340) have the audacity to come to human\
[0:39:02](https://youtu.be/7gAwa9i-Vrw?t=2342) beings and\
[0:39:03](https://youtu.be/7gAwa9i-Vrw?t=2343) blame them for anything it wasn't my\
[0:39:05](https://youtu.be/7gAwa9i-Vrw?t=2345) fault\
[0:39:06](https://youtu.be/7gAwa9i-Vrw?t=2346) everything according to this world view\
[0:39:09](https://youtu.be/7gAwa9i-Vrw?t=2349) was because of an uninterrupted causal\
[0:39:11](https://youtu.be/7gAwa9i-Vrw?t=2351) line\
[0:39:11](https://youtu.be/7gAwa9i-Vrw?t=2351) which forced and compelled me to this\
[0:39:14](https://youtu.be/7gAwa9i-Vrw?t=2354) you know just to add to that they are so\
[0:39:17](https://youtu.be/7gAwa9i-Vrw?t=2357) loud about human rights\
[0:39:19](https://youtu.be/7gAwa9i-Vrw?t=2359) yeah human rights is like you know\
[0:39:22](https://youtu.be/7gAwa9i-Vrw?t=2362) pronouns and\
[0:39:24](https://youtu.be/7gAwa9i-Vrw?t=2364) uh feminism and all this stuff but it's\
[0:39:27](https://youtu.be/7gAwa9i-Vrw?t=2367) all meaningless\
[0:39:28](https://youtu.be/7gAwa9i-Vrw?t=2368) under determinism absolutely uh uh oh um\
[0:39:31](https://youtu.be/7gAwa9i-Vrw?t=2371) you know i'm just determined to be you\
[0:39:34](https://youtu.be/7gAwa9i-Vrw?t=2374) know to not care\
[0:39:35](https://youtu.be/7gAwa9i-Vrw?t=2375) about these things okay you're\
[0:39:36](https://youtu.be/7gAwa9i-Vrw?t=2376) determined to care about them it's just\
[0:39:39](https://youtu.be/7gAwa9i-Vrw?t=2379) and you know i i think this is a good\
[0:39:41](https://youtu.be/7gAwa9i-Vrw?t=2381) segue to bring in\
[0:39:42](https://youtu.be/7gAwa9i-Vrw?t=2382) your research about uh during your\
[0:39:45](https://youtu.be/7gAwa9i-Vrw?t=2385) masters on\
[0:39:46](https://youtu.be/7gAwa9i-Vrw?t=2386) how moral issues are seen as so\
[0:39:49](https://youtu.be/7gAwa9i-Vrw?t=2389) important\
[0:39:50](https://youtu.be/7gAwa9i-Vrw?t=2390) they're more important than the\
[0:39:51](https://youtu.be/7gAwa9i-Vrw?t=2391) scientific issues other issues\
[0:39:53](https://youtu.be/7gAwa9i-Vrw?t=2393) yet those moral things become completely\
[0:39:56](https://youtu.be/7gAwa9i-Vrw?t=2396) irrelevant\
[0:39:56](https://youtu.be/7gAwa9i-Vrw?t=2396) if when you take determinism absolutely\
[0:40:00](https://youtu.be/7gAwa9i-Vrw?t=2400) the new atheist the new atheist project\
[0:40:03](https://youtu.be/7gAwa9i-Vrw?t=2403) one of its main\
[0:40:05](https://youtu.be/7gAwa9i-Vrw?t=2405) kind of arguments against religion is\
[0:40:07](https://youtu.be/7gAwa9i-Vrw?t=2407) moral yeah\
[0:40:09](https://youtu.be/7gAwa9i-Vrw?t=2409) but if half of them are saying that\
[0:40:11](https://youtu.be/7gAwa9i-Vrw?t=2411) we're determinists i know daniel dennett\
[0:40:12](https://youtu.be/7gAwa9i-Vrw?t=2412) doesn't believe in that he has an\
[0:40:14](https://youtu.be/7gAwa9i-Vrw?t=2414) argument with\
[0:40:15](https://youtu.be/7gAwa9i-Vrw?t=2415) harris so i'm not saying all that but\
[0:40:16](https://youtu.be/7gAwa9i-Vrw?t=2416) someone like harris he's a complete\
[0:40:18](https://youtu.be/7gAwa9i-Vrw?t=2418) hypocrite\
[0:40:19](https://youtu.be/7gAwa9i-Vrw?t=2419) sam harris is a complete hypocrite\
[0:40:21](https://youtu.be/7gAwa9i-Vrw?t=2421) because why\
[0:40:22](https://youtu.be/7gAwa9i-Vrw?t=2422) is sam harris challenging religion on\
[0:40:25](https://youtu.be/7gAwa9i-Vrw?t=2425) moral bases\
[0:40:26](https://youtu.be/7gAwa9i-Vrw?t=2426) when in fact morality or at least\
[0:40:30](https://youtu.be/7gAwa9i-Vrw?t=2430) individual responsibility\
[0:40:32](https://youtu.be/7gAwa9i-Vrw?t=2432) is totally suspended on a deterministic\
[0:40:35](https://youtu.be/7gAwa9i-Vrw?t=2435) worldview\
[0:40:36](https://youtu.be/7gAwa9i-Vrw?t=2436) a human being on determinism\
[0:40:39](https://youtu.be/7gAwa9i-Vrw?t=2439) is not responsible for their behavior\
[0:40:43](https://youtu.be/7gAwa9i-Vrw?t=2443) a human being on determinism is a puppet\
[0:40:47](https://youtu.be/7gAwa9i-Vrw?t=2447) yes they are puppet and that which is\
[0:40:51](https://youtu.be/7gAwa9i-Vrw?t=2451) puppeteering them\
[0:40:52](https://youtu.be/7gAwa9i-Vrw?t=2452) is the uninterrupted causal line of\
[0:40:55](https://youtu.be/7gAwa9i-Vrw?t=2455) events so for someone like this\
[0:40:59](https://youtu.be/7gAwa9i-Vrw?t=2459) sam harris and co who are cowards yeah\
[0:41:01](https://youtu.be/7gAwa9i-Vrw?t=2461) because they will never\
[0:41:02](https://youtu.be/7gAwa9i-Vrw?t=2462) yeah come forward and debate anyone on\
[0:41:04](https://youtu.be/7gAwa9i-Vrw?t=2464) these matters\
[0:41:06](https://youtu.be/7gAwa9i-Vrw?t=2466) and they're having debates only among\
[0:41:07](https://youtu.be/7gAwa9i-Vrw?t=2467) their own little echo chambers\
[0:41:10](https://youtu.be/7gAwa9i-Vrw?t=2470) how on earth and how dare they come out\
[0:41:13](https://youtu.be/7gAwa9i-Vrw?t=2473) and challenge religion on a basis like\
[0:41:16](https://youtu.be/7gAwa9i-Vrw?t=2476) this\
[0:41:17](https://youtu.be/7gAwa9i-Vrw?t=2477) this is a clear-cut contradiction which\
[0:41:20](https://youtu.be/7gAwa9i-Vrw?t=2480) i i'm actually shocked hasn't been\
[0:41:23](https://youtu.be/7gAwa9i-Vrw?t=2483) called out\
[0:41:24](https://youtu.be/7gAwa9i-Vrw?t=2484) and he's had conversations with\
[0:41:26](https://youtu.be/7gAwa9i-Vrw?t=2486) intellectuals like jordan peterson and\
[0:41:28](https://youtu.be/7gAwa9i-Vrw?t=2488) uh others you know yeah why isn't anyone\
[0:41:31](https://youtu.be/7gAwa9i-Vrw?t=2491) like ben shapiro maybe even\
[0:41:38](https://youtu.be/7gAwa9i-Vrw?t=2498) have you not understood this determinism\
[0:41:40](https://youtu.be/7gAwa9i-Vrw?t=2500) is you are not responsible for your own\
[0:41:42](https://youtu.be/7gAwa9i-Vrw?t=2502) behavior\
[0:41:44](https://youtu.be/7gAwa9i-Vrw?t=2504) come on and you know um when you see\
[0:41:46](https://youtu.be/7gAwa9i-Vrw?t=2506) these hard determinists\
[0:41:48](https://youtu.be/7gAwa9i-Vrw?t=2508) trying to explain themselves and trying\
[0:41:50](https://youtu.be/7gAwa9i-Vrw?t=2510) to explain why they believe in\
[0:41:51](https://youtu.be/7gAwa9i-Vrw?t=2511) punishment\
[0:41:52](https://youtu.be/7gAwa9i-Vrw?t=2512) why they believe in accountability why\
[0:41:54](https://youtu.be/7gAwa9i-Vrw?t=2514) they believe in the justice system or\
[0:41:56](https://youtu.be/7gAwa9i-Vrw?t=2516) morality or any of these types of things\
[0:41:58](https://youtu.be/7gAwa9i-Vrw?t=2518) you find that they're just playing\
[0:42:00](https://youtu.be/7gAwa9i-Vrw?t=2520) semantical games they really\
[0:42:02](https://youtu.be/7gAwa9i-Vrw?t=2522) do not accept hard determinism although\
[0:42:05](https://youtu.be/7gAwa9i-Vrw?t=2525) they just label themselves\
[0:42:07](https://youtu.be/7gAwa9i-Vrw?t=2527) because there is consequentialism yeah\
[0:42:08](https://youtu.be/7gAwa9i-Vrw?t=2528) yeah he said well how are you going to\
[0:42:09](https://youtu.be/7gAwa9i-Vrw?t=2529) be a consequentialist determinist yeah\
[0:42:11](https://youtu.be/7gAwa9i-Vrw?t=2531) well yeah you're giving us like a\
[0:42:13](https://youtu.be/7gAwa9i-Vrw?t=2533) welfare you know consequentialism and\
[0:42:15](https://youtu.be/7gAwa9i-Vrw?t=2535) then you're determined so everything is\
[0:42:16](https://youtu.be/7gAwa9i-Vrw?t=2536) like it's everything now your behaviors\
[0:42:19](https://youtu.be/7gAwa9i-Vrw?t=2539) your silly train\
[0:42:20](https://youtu.be/7gAwa9i-Vrw?t=2540) uh idea why is this that's unbelievable\
[0:42:24](https://youtu.be/7gAwa9i-Vrw?t=2544) these are the intellectuals of the day\
[0:42:26](https://youtu.be/7gAwa9i-Vrw?t=2546) yeah\
[0:42:28](https://youtu.be/7gAwa9i-Vrw?t=2548) you don't realize subhanallah you know\
[0:42:30](https://youtu.be/7gAwa9i-Vrw?t=2550) the islamic court has been dealing with\
[0:42:31](https://youtu.be/7gAwa9i-Vrw?t=2551) this question\
[0:42:33](https://youtu.be/7gAwa9i-Vrw?t=2553) for thousands 300 years they pretend\
[0:42:35](https://youtu.be/7gAwa9i-Vrw?t=2555) they came to the party\
[0:42:36](https://youtu.be/7gAwa9i-Vrw?t=2556) and they realized all the stuff all this\
[0:42:38](https://youtu.be/7gAwa9i-Vrw?t=2558) stuff and no one\
[0:42:40](https://youtu.be/7gAwa9i-Vrw?t=2560) no one before them but you know like\
[0:42:42](https://youtu.be/7gAwa9i-Vrw?t=2562) like the old saying uh there's nothing\
[0:42:44](https://youtu.be/7gAwa9i-Vrw?t=2564) new under the sun\
[0:42:45](https://youtu.be/7gAwa9i-Vrw?t=2565) yeah yeah it's i mean they're primitive\
[0:42:48](https://youtu.be/7gAwa9i-Vrw?t=2568) in their thinking because what they're\
[0:42:50](https://youtu.be/7gAwa9i-Vrw?t=2570) doing is they're kind of like\
[0:42:52](https://youtu.be/7gAwa9i-Vrw?t=2572) the answers be and we're like no we're\
[0:42:54](https://youtu.be/7gAwa9i-Vrw?t=2574) asking you a philosophical question\
[0:42:56](https://youtu.be/7gAwa9i-Vrw?t=2576) i said you\
[0:43:00](https://youtu.be/7gAwa9i-Vrw?t=2580) you know these people these new atheists\
[0:43:02](https://youtu.be/7gAwa9i-Vrw?t=2582) because they don't a lot of them don't\
[0:43:03](https://youtu.be/7gAwa9i-Vrw?t=2583) even believe\
[0:43:04](https://youtu.be/7gAwa9i-Vrw?t=2584) in theology as a subject that's what uh\
[0:43:07](https://youtu.be/7gAwa9i-Vrw?t=2587) and a lot of them have a disdain for\
[0:43:09](https://youtu.be/7gAwa9i-Vrw?t=2589) philosophy like for example they're\
[0:43:11](https://youtu.be/7gAwa9i-Vrw?t=2591) yeah and that's why he was humiliated by\
[0:43:12](https://youtu.be/7gAwa9i-Vrw?t=2592) uh pigleyuchi and that lecture by\
[0:43:15](https://youtu.be/7gAwa9i-Vrw?t=2595) telling him\
[0:43:15](https://youtu.be/7gAwa9i-Vrw?t=2595) you know these are eight things and he's\
[0:43:17](https://youtu.be/7gAwa9i-Vrw?t=2597) supposed to be a new atheist\
[0:43:18](https://youtu.be/7gAwa9i-Vrw?t=2598) as well bro the worst thing is what the\
[0:43:21](https://youtu.be/7gAwa9i-Vrw?t=2601) issue is they refuse to stand on the\
[0:43:23](https://youtu.be/7gAwa9i-Vrw?t=2603) shoulders of\
[0:43:24](https://youtu.be/7gAwa9i-Vrw?t=2604) giants oh they refused the fact that\
[0:43:27](https://youtu.be/7gAwa9i-Vrw?t=2607) people before they were intelligent as\
[0:43:28](https://youtu.be/7gAwa9i-Vrw?t=2608) well not only intelligent but they have\
[0:43:30](https://youtu.be/7gAwa9i-Vrw?t=2610) dealt with their issues\
[0:43:31](https://youtu.be/7gAwa9i-Vrw?t=2611) shown a contradiction in their reasoning\
[0:43:33](https://youtu.be/7gAwa9i-Vrw?t=2613) and have\
[0:43:34](https://youtu.be/7gAwa9i-Vrw?t=2614) a whole legacy to show what kind of\
[0:43:36](https://youtu.be/7gAwa9i-Vrw?t=2616) contribution they're talking about\
[0:43:39](https://youtu.be/7gAwa9i-Vrw?t=2619) sam harris's views on determinism and\
[0:43:40](https://youtu.be/7gAwa9i-Vrw?t=2620) consequentialism are so contradictory\
[0:43:43](https://youtu.be/7gAwa9i-Vrw?t=2623) that actually\
[0:43:43](https://youtu.be/7gAwa9i-Vrw?t=2623) it actually makes me angry brother yeah\
[0:43:45](https://youtu.be/7gAwa9i-Vrw?t=2625) well i actually makes me angry that some\
[0:43:47](https://youtu.be/7gAwa9i-Vrw?t=2627) atheists are going around\
[0:43:48](https://youtu.be/7gAwa9i-Vrw?t=2628) and actually copying his style makes me\
[0:43:50](https://youtu.be/7gAwa9i-Vrw?t=2630) angry yeah yeah and\
[0:43:51](https://youtu.be/7gAwa9i-Vrw?t=2631) even um just a segway um\
[0:43:55](https://youtu.be/7gAwa9i-Vrw?t=2635) his debate with craig william lane craig\
[0:43:58](https://youtu.be/7gAwa9i-Vrw?t=2638) right\
[0:43:59](https://youtu.be/7gAwa9i-Vrw?t=2639) yes there's some debates that what you\
[0:44:01](https://youtu.be/7gAwa9i-Vrw?t=2641) do\
[0:44:02](https://youtu.be/7gAwa9i-Vrw?t=2642) is after the debate the most respectable\
[0:44:04](https://youtu.be/7gAwa9i-Vrw?t=2644) thing is you just take off your coat\
[0:44:07](https://youtu.be/7gAwa9i-Vrw?t=2647) and you go work in a 7-eleven or a\
[0:44:09](https://youtu.be/7gAwa9i-Vrw?t=2649) petrol station\
[0:44:10](https://youtu.be/7gAwa9i-Vrw?t=2650) and that's it that's it there's no point\
[0:44:13](https://youtu.be/7gAwa9i-Vrw?t=2653) carrying on so like the debate with\
[0:44:14](https://youtu.be/7gAwa9i-Vrw?t=2654) david wood where he decided to carry on\
[0:44:17](https://youtu.be/7gAwa9i-Vrw?t=2657) debate with sam harris he decided to\
[0:44:18](https://youtu.be/7gAwa9i-Vrw?t=2658) carry on but actually anybody that\
[0:44:20](https://youtu.be/7gAwa9i-Vrw?t=2660) watches that debate i'm being honest\
[0:44:22](https://youtu.be/7gAwa9i-Vrw?t=2662) with you\
[0:44:22](https://youtu.be/7gAwa9i-Vrw?t=2662) guys i don't think i've ever seen\
[0:44:26](https://youtu.be/7gAwa9i-Vrw?t=2666) an atheist lose that badly yet still if\
[0:44:29](https://youtu.be/7gAwa9i-Vrw?t=2669) you watch every single one of his\
[0:44:30](https://youtu.be/7gAwa9i-Vrw?t=2670) replies he's he he's\
[0:44:32](https://youtu.be/7gAwa9i-Vrw?t=2672) he's basically doing motivism he's\
[0:44:34](https://youtu.be/7gAwa9i-Vrw?t=2674) trying to steal well that's why he's\
[0:44:35](https://youtu.be/7gAwa9i-Vrw?t=2675) retired bro yeah yeah\
[0:44:37](https://youtu.be/7gAwa9i-Vrw?t=2677) why do you think he's retired from\
[0:44:37](https://youtu.be/7gAwa9i-Vrw?t=2677) debating he's retired from debating\
[0:44:39](https://youtu.be/7gAwa9i-Vrw?t=2679) because now he's going on spiritualism\
[0:44:41](https://youtu.be/7gAwa9i-Vrw?t=2681) yeah talking about scripture and this\
[0:44:43](https://youtu.be/7gAwa9i-Vrw?t=2683) and that lost the plot\
[0:44:44](https://youtu.be/7gAwa9i-Vrw?t=2684) bro let me let's be honest with him yeah\
[0:44:47](https://youtu.be/7gAwa9i-Vrw?t=2687) this message to sam harris and someone\
[0:44:48](https://youtu.be/7gAwa9i-Vrw?t=2688) sent this to him maybe one of the guys\
[0:44:50](https://youtu.be/7gAwa9i-Vrw?t=2690) cut this out\
[0:44:51](https://youtu.be/7gAwa9i-Vrw?t=2691) yeah and send it to him yeah listen sam\
[0:44:54](https://youtu.be/7gAwa9i-Vrw?t=2694) we know that you're trying to be a\
[0:44:55](https://youtu.be/7gAwa9i-Vrw?t=2695) spiritualist because you have\
[0:44:56](https://youtu.be/7gAwa9i-Vrw?t=2696) a spiritual void yeah you have a\
[0:44:59](https://youtu.be/7gAwa9i-Vrw?t=2699) spiritual void because\
[0:45:01](https://youtu.be/7gAwa9i-Vrw?t=2701) sam harris you're an atheist\
[0:45:04](https://youtu.be/7gAwa9i-Vrw?t=2704) and not only are you an atheist but you\
[0:45:05](https://youtu.be/7gAwa9i-Vrw?t=2705) are a determinist suffering from\
[0:45:07](https://youtu.be/7gAwa9i-Vrw?t=2707) cognitive dissonance because somehow\
[0:45:09](https://youtu.be/7gAwa9i-Vrw?t=2709) you're a consequentialist as well\
[0:45:10](https://youtu.be/7gAwa9i-Vrw?t=2710) these are incompatible that's right\
[0:45:13](https://youtu.be/7gAwa9i-Vrw?t=2713) these are incompatible philosophical\
[0:45:14](https://youtu.be/7gAwa9i-Vrw?t=2714) postulations\
[0:45:16](https://youtu.be/7gAwa9i-Vrw?t=2716) consequentialism assumes that you have\
[0:45:19](https://youtu.be/7gAwa9i-Vrw?t=2719) um you have volition and you have free\
[0:45:21](https://youtu.be/7gAwa9i-Vrw?t=2721) will whereas determinism\
[0:45:22](https://youtu.be/7gAwa9i-Vrw?t=2722) completely denies that so you going now\
[0:45:25](https://youtu.be/7gAwa9i-Vrw?t=2725) to be a spiritualist and helping people\
[0:45:26](https://youtu.be/7gAwa9i-Vrw?t=2726) breathe and this and that and think of\
[0:45:29](https://youtu.be/7gAwa9i-Vrw?t=2729) little depression leaving depression you\
[0:45:31](https://youtu.be/7gAwa9i-Vrw?t=2731) will not be able to do that because\
[0:45:33](https://youtu.be/7gAwa9i-Vrw?t=2733) you have already determined that there\
[0:45:36](https://youtu.be/7gAwa9i-Vrw?t=2736) is a limit to our existence and that is\
[0:45:38](https://youtu.be/7gAwa9i-Vrw?t=2738) the empirical\
[0:45:38](https://youtu.be/7gAwa9i-Vrw?t=2738) naturalistic limit therefore you trying\
[0:45:41](https://youtu.be/7gAwa9i-Vrw?t=2741) to be a spiritualist of some\
[0:45:43](https://youtu.be/7gAwa9i-Vrw?t=2743) an atheist guru of some sort is as\
[0:45:46](https://youtu.be/7gAwa9i-Vrw?t=2746) joke as a joke as hitler trying to be an\
[0:45:49](https://youtu.be/7gAwa9i-Vrw?t=2749) advocate for the anti-semitic\
[0:45:50](https://youtu.be/7gAwa9i-Vrw?t=2750) for the anti-semitic party don't try it\
[0:45:53](https://youtu.be/7gAwa9i-Vrw?t=2753) my friend\
[0:45:53](https://youtu.be/7gAwa9i-Vrw?t=2753) yeah and you're trying to give people an\
[0:45:56](https://youtu.be/7gAwa9i-Vrw?t=2756) alternative you realize that people\
[0:45:57](https://youtu.be/7gAwa9i-Vrw?t=2757) require the spirit\
[0:45:59](https://youtu.be/7gAwa9i-Vrw?t=2759) bro it's an admission well no not only\
[0:46:00](https://youtu.be/7gAwa9i-Vrw?t=2760) this enough people need spirituality\
[0:46:03](https://youtu.be/7gAwa9i-Vrw?t=2763) you bang on about science and how\
[0:46:05](https://youtu.be/7gAwa9i-Vrw?t=2765) western\
[0:46:06](https://youtu.be/7gAwa9i-Vrw?t=2766) world came up with science and how\
[0:46:08](https://youtu.be/7gAwa9i-Vrw?t=2768) science is the way that we should be\
[0:46:10](https://youtu.be/7gAwa9i-Vrw?t=2770) trying to understand the world\
[0:46:12](https://youtu.be/7gAwa9i-Vrw?t=2772) yeah this is the new hds narrative yeah\
[0:46:14](https://youtu.be/7gAwa9i-Vrw?t=2774) at the same time yeah you're talking\
[0:46:15](https://youtu.be/7gAwa9i-Vrw?t=2775) about spirituality which has no\
[0:46:17](https://youtu.be/7gAwa9i-Vrw?t=2777) scientific basis absolutely\
[0:46:19](https://youtu.be/7gAwa9i-Vrw?t=2779) absolutely yeah it's crucial absolutely\
[0:46:22](https://youtu.be/7gAwa9i-Vrw?t=2782) so\
[0:46:23](https://youtu.be/7gAwa9i-Vrw?t=2783) brother junaid sorry about that before\
[0:46:25](https://youtu.be/7gAwa9i-Vrw?t=2785) banging on about this guy but\
[0:46:26](https://youtu.be/7gAwa9i-Vrw?t=2786) um\
[0:46:30](https://youtu.be/7gAwa9i-Vrw?t=2790) we will now go to french muslim\
[0:46:33](https://youtu.be/7gAwa9i-Vrw?t=2793) i'm assuming you're from germany\
[0:46:36](https://youtu.be/7gAwa9i-Vrw?t=2796) is that right me no no i'm french right\
[0:46:40](https://youtu.be/7gAwa9i-Vrw?t=2800) you're french\
[0:46:43](https://youtu.be/7gAwa9i-Vrw?t=2803) so yeah thank you uh first of all i'd\
[0:46:45](https://youtu.be/7gAwa9i-Vrw?t=2805) like to apologize for slaughtering\
[0:46:47](https://youtu.be/7gAwa9i-Vrw?t=2807) english\
[0:46:47](https://youtu.be/7gAwa9i-Vrw?t=2807) with my french accent i'll try to to be\
[0:46:49](https://youtu.be/7gAwa9i-Vrw?t=2809) as scared as possible sorry what's that\
[0:46:52](https://youtu.be/7gAwa9i-Vrw?t=2812) uh i said that first of all yeah\
[0:47:00](https://youtu.be/7gAwa9i-Vrw?t=2820) \[Music]\
[0:47:02](https://youtu.be/7gAwa9i-Vrw?t=2822) okay so i have a question for subor um\
[0:47:04](https://youtu.be/7gAwa9i-Vrw?t=2824) regarding evolution and more\
[0:47:06](https://youtu.be/7gAwa9i-Vrw?t=2826) particularly\
[0:47:06](https://youtu.be/7gAwa9i-Vrw?t=2826) than vestigial organs um\
[0:47:10](https://youtu.be/7gAwa9i-Vrw?t=2830) this is a question with today to a\
[0:47:12](https://youtu.be/7gAwa9i-Vrw?t=2832) dimension\
[0:47:13](https://youtu.be/7gAwa9i-Vrw?t=2833) i like i i try to to make it in one\
[0:47:16](https://youtu.be/7gAwa9i-Vrw?t=2836) question\
[0:47:17](https://youtu.be/7gAwa9i-Vrw?t=2837) so a recent paper showed how during the\
[0:47:20](https://youtu.be/7gAwa9i-Vrw?t=2840) embryo\
[0:47:20](https://youtu.be/7gAwa9i-Vrw?t=2840) genesis how we see additional muscle\
[0:47:24](https://youtu.be/7gAwa9i-Vrw?t=2844) developing in the ends of the embryo and\
[0:47:27](https://youtu.be/7gAwa9i-Vrw?t=2847) which is which are\
[0:47:28](https://youtu.be/7gAwa9i-Vrw?t=2848) supposedly like reptiles muscle so the\
[0:47:31](https://youtu.be/7gAwa9i-Vrw?t=2851) muscles develop and then die\
[0:47:33](https://youtu.be/7gAwa9i-Vrw?t=2853) and the paper identified this as a\
[0:47:35](https://youtu.be/7gAwa9i-Vrw?t=2855) phenomenon has a reminiscence of reptile\
[0:47:38](https://youtu.be/7gAwa9i-Vrw?t=2858) muscles\
[0:47:38](https://youtu.be/7gAwa9i-Vrw?t=2858) and which is supposedly come from a\
[0:47:41](https://youtu.be/7gAwa9i-Vrw?t=2861) distant common ancestor\
[0:47:42](https://youtu.be/7gAwa9i-Vrw?t=2862) of human being um so there is this\
[0:47:45](https://youtu.be/7gAwa9i-Vrw?t=2865) dimension\
[0:47:46](https://youtu.be/7gAwa9i-Vrw?t=2866) and another dimension to make it short\
[0:47:48](https://youtu.be/7gAwa9i-Vrw?t=2868) uh which is like the palmaris longus\
[0:47:50](https://youtu.be/7gAwa9i-Vrw?t=2870) muscle you know in the in the forearm\
[0:47:52](https://youtu.be/7gAwa9i-Vrw?t=2872) which is a slightly different issue\
[0:47:54](https://youtu.be/7gAwa9i-Vrw?t=2874) because uh\
[0:47:54](https://youtu.be/7gAwa9i-Vrw?t=2874) this is not like the appendice or\
[0:47:56](https://youtu.be/7gAwa9i-Vrw?t=2876) something like that because this is not\
[0:47:58](https://youtu.be/7gAwa9i-Vrw?t=2878) present in every human being\
[0:47:59](https://youtu.be/7gAwa9i-Vrw?t=2879) uh this is a and whether or not it's\
[0:48:02](https://youtu.be/7gAwa9i-Vrw?t=2882) present\
[0:48:02](https://youtu.be/7gAwa9i-Vrw?t=2882) it it has no effect on like the the\
[0:48:05](https://youtu.be/7gAwa9i-Vrw?t=2885) power in your hand or\
[0:48:07](https://youtu.be/7gAwa9i-Vrw?t=2887) in your forearm so how do how do we deal\
[0:48:09](https://youtu.be/7gAwa9i-Vrw?t=2889) with that\
[0:48:10](https://youtu.be/7gAwa9i-Vrw?t=2890) because i know that you've dealt with\
[0:48:11](https://youtu.be/7gAwa9i-Vrw?t=2891) this issue in many videos and uh\
[0:48:13](https://youtu.be/7gAwa9i-Vrw?t=2893) barakah laufik for for your work it\
[0:48:15](https://youtu.be/7gAwa9i-Vrw?t=2895) helps a lot thank you\
[0:48:17](https://youtu.be/7gAwa9i-Vrw?t=2897) so yeah very good question the thing is\
[0:48:19](https://youtu.be/7gAwa9i-Vrw?t=2899) firstly for the benefit of viewers i'm\
[0:48:20](https://youtu.be/7gAwa9i-Vrw?t=2900) just going to dump things down a little\
[0:48:22](https://youtu.be/7gAwa9i-Vrw?t=2902) bit\
[0:48:23](https://youtu.be/7gAwa9i-Vrw?t=2903) by explaining what is vestigial organs\
[0:48:25](https://youtu.be/7gAwa9i-Vrw?t=2905) um\
[0:48:26](https://youtu.be/7gAwa9i-Vrw?t=2906) so in essence vestigial organs are\
[0:48:29](https://youtu.be/7gAwa9i-Vrw?t=2909) going to be um parts of the body which\
[0:48:34](https://youtu.be/7gAwa9i-Vrw?t=2914) had a function and no longer have a\
[0:48:36](https://youtu.be/7gAwa9i-Vrw?t=2916) function and therefore\
[0:48:37](https://youtu.be/7gAwa9i-Vrw?t=2917) are vestigial right they're just like\
[0:48:40](https://youtu.be/7gAwa9i-Vrw?t=2920) this\
[0:48:40](https://youtu.be/7gAwa9i-Vrw?t=2920) yeah well they they used to say that\
[0:48:42](https://youtu.be/7gAwa9i-Vrw?t=2922) about the appendix is\
[0:48:43](https://youtu.be/7gAwa9i-Vrw?t=2923) good you raise the appendix because now\
[0:48:45](https://youtu.be/7gAwa9i-Vrw?t=2925) we know the appendix actually has some\
[0:48:47](https://youtu.be/7gAwa9i-Vrw?t=2927) very important functions although darwin\
[0:48:49](https://youtu.be/7gAwa9i-Vrw?t=2929) said he was vestigial the first thing i\
[0:48:51](https://youtu.be/7gAwa9i-Vrw?t=2931) want you to understand brother\
[0:48:53](https://youtu.be/7gAwa9i-Vrw?t=2933) is that common ancestry is not an\
[0:48:57](https://youtu.be/7gAwa9i-Vrw?t=2937) assumption\
[0:48:58](https://youtu.be/7gAwa9i-Vrw?t=2938) it's not a hypothesis it's not a theory\
[0:49:01](https://youtu.be/7gAwa9i-Vrw?t=2941) it is a\
[0:49:03](https://youtu.be/7gAwa9i-Vrw?t=2943) unquestioned paradigm\
[0:49:06](https://youtu.be/7gAwa9i-Vrw?t=2946) the bedrock of evolutionary theory\
[0:49:09](https://youtu.be/7gAwa9i-Vrw?t=2949) so um paul nelson i'm not sure if you\
[0:49:12](https://youtu.be/7gAwa9i-Vrw?t=2952) uh saw my interviews with him he he\
[0:49:15](https://youtu.be/7gAwa9i-Vrw?t=2955) points this out he's a philosopher of\
[0:49:16](https://youtu.be/7gAwa9i-Vrw?t=2956) biology that\
[0:49:17](https://youtu.be/7gAwa9i-Vrw?t=2957) it's not even up for questioning and\
[0:49:18](https://youtu.be/7gAwa9i-Vrw?t=2958) there's no scientific evidence\
[0:49:21](https://youtu.be/7gAwa9i-Vrw?t=2961) which could hypothetically challenge it\
[0:49:24](https://youtu.be/7gAwa9i-Vrw?t=2964) because\
[0:49:24](https://youtu.be/7gAwa9i-Vrw?t=2964) it's just taken as no matter what i mean\
[0:49:27](https://youtu.be/7gAwa9i-Vrw?t=2967) it's like\
[0:49:27](https://youtu.be/7gAwa9i-Vrw?t=2967) a plus b is equal to c right so c\
[0:49:31](https://youtu.be/7gAwa9i-Vrw?t=2971) is common ancestry no matter what it\
[0:49:33](https://youtu.be/7gAwa9i-Vrw?t=2973) always adds up to c c is always always\
[0:49:35](https://youtu.be/7gAwa9i-Vrw?t=2975) there\
[0:49:35](https://youtu.be/7gAwa9i-Vrw?t=2975) so vestigial organs from an islamic\
[0:49:39](https://youtu.be/7gAwa9i-Vrw?t=2979) perspective from a creationist\
[0:49:41](https://youtu.be/7gAwa9i-Vrw?t=2981) perspective\
[0:49:42](https://youtu.be/7gAwa9i-Vrw?t=2982) there's nothing wrong with the idea of\
[0:49:45](https://youtu.be/7gAwa9i-Vrw?t=2985) believing that they were organs which\
[0:49:47](https://youtu.be/7gAwa9i-Vrw?t=2987) were used and then\
[0:49:48](https://youtu.be/7gAwa9i-Vrw?t=2988) over time we lost functions for them so\
[0:49:50](https://youtu.be/7gAwa9i-Vrw?t=2990) for example i was watching a very\
[0:49:52](https://youtu.be/7gAwa9i-Vrw?t=2992) interesting documentary about these fish\
[0:49:56](https://youtu.be/7gAwa9i-Vrw?t=2996) who were living uh\
[0:49:59](https://youtu.be/7gAwa9i-Vrw?t=2999) and uh they were living in a part of the\
[0:50:01](https://youtu.be/7gAwa9i-Vrw?t=3001) ocean where obviously they were using\
[0:50:03](https://youtu.be/7gAwa9i-Vrw?t=3003) their eyes and stuff like this\
[0:50:05](https://youtu.be/7gAwa9i-Vrw?t=3005) then what happened is um they actually\
[0:50:07](https://youtu.be/7gAwa9i-Vrw?t=3007) got trapped\
[0:50:08](https://youtu.be/7gAwa9i-Vrw?t=3008) near this desert area in which they got\
[0:50:11](https://youtu.be/7gAwa9i-Vrw?t=3011) trapped underneath\
[0:50:13](https://youtu.be/7gAwa9i-Vrw?t=3013) some basically they got cut off from\
[0:50:15](https://youtu.be/7gAwa9i-Vrw?t=3015) natural light\
[0:50:17](https://youtu.be/7gAwa9i-Vrw?t=3017) and then they reproduced and reproduced\
[0:50:19](https://youtu.be/7gAwa9i-Vrw?t=3019) and as you know\
[0:50:20](https://youtu.be/7gAwa9i-Vrw?t=3020) um the human body it conserves\
[0:50:23](https://youtu.be/7gAwa9i-Vrw?t=3023) um energy right and humans even us\
[0:50:27](https://youtu.be/7gAwa9i-Vrw?t=3027) uh if we stop using something our body\
[0:50:30](https://youtu.be/7gAwa9i-Vrw?t=3030) stops putting energy towards that thing\
[0:50:32](https://youtu.be/7gAwa9i-Vrw?t=3032) right so what happened was over time and\
[0:50:35](https://youtu.be/7gAwa9i-Vrw?t=3035) your eyes use up a lot of energy now it\
[0:50:37](https://youtu.be/7gAwa9i-Vrw?t=3037) was pitched up\
[0:50:39](https://youtu.be/7gAwa9i-Vrw?t=3039) these fish basically um\
[0:50:42](https://youtu.be/7gAwa9i-Vrw?t=3042) they still had the eye sockets but then\
[0:50:45](https://youtu.be/7gAwa9i-Vrw?t=3045) the eyes no longer\
[0:50:47](https://youtu.be/7gAwa9i-Vrw?t=3047) were uh of any benefit so therefore all\
[0:50:50](https://youtu.be/7gAwa9i-Vrw?t=3050) of the children that they're reproducing\
[0:50:52](https://youtu.be/7gAwa9i-Vrw?t=3052) they're basically blind um and\
[0:50:55](https://youtu.be/7gAwa9i-Vrw?t=3055) uh having the using that extra energy\
[0:50:59](https://youtu.be/7gAwa9i-Vrw?t=3059) using the eyes is no longer there\
[0:51:01](https://youtu.be/7gAwa9i-Vrw?t=3061) that's vestigial right the idea that\
[0:51:04](https://youtu.be/7gAwa9i-Vrw?t=3064) vestigial\
[0:51:06](https://youtu.be/7gAwa9i-Vrw?t=3066) is against um god's design or anything\
[0:51:09](https://youtu.be/7gAwa9i-Vrw?t=3069) like that is nonsense\
[0:51:10](https://youtu.be/7gAwa9i-Vrw?t=3070) so even if vestigial was actually\
[0:51:13](https://youtu.be/7gAwa9i-Vrw?t=3073) vestigial like in the case of the\
[0:51:14](https://youtu.be/7gAwa9i-Vrw?t=3074) appendix it turned out\
[0:51:15](https://youtu.be/7gAwa9i-Vrw?t=3075) that the appendix it reserves\
[0:51:19](https://youtu.be/7gAwa9i-Vrw?t=3079) some bacteria which is useful uh as a\
[0:51:21](https://youtu.be/7gAwa9i-Vrw?t=3081) backup\
[0:51:22](https://youtu.be/7gAwa9i-Vrw?t=3082) also it plays a role in young infants so\
[0:51:25](https://youtu.be/7gAwa9i-Vrw?t=3085) there's\
[0:51:25](https://youtu.be/7gAwa9i-Vrw?t=3085) reasons for the appendix but even if it\
[0:51:28](https://youtu.be/7gAwa9i-Vrw?t=3088) was purely\
[0:51:29](https://youtu.be/7gAwa9i-Vrw?t=3089) residual um it still wouldn't mean\
[0:51:33](https://youtu.be/7gAwa9i-Vrw?t=3093) that it fits within the darwinian\
[0:51:35](https://youtu.be/7gAwa9i-Vrw?t=3095) picture is bad design like they say\
[0:51:38](https://youtu.be/7gAwa9i-Vrw?t=3098) but what you have to understand is\
[0:51:39](https://youtu.be/7gAwa9i-Vrw?t=3099) because now they have something that\
[0:51:41](https://youtu.be/7gAwa9i-Vrw?t=3101) one either is truly vestigial or two\
[0:51:45](https://youtu.be/7gAwa9i-Vrw?t=3105) it's a false positive it may be\
[0:51:46](https://youtu.be/7gAwa9i-Vrw?t=3106) vestigial according to the best of our\
[0:51:48](https://youtu.be/7gAwa9i-Vrw?t=3108) knowledge but it may turn out not to be\
[0:51:50](https://youtu.be/7gAwa9i-Vrw?t=3110) the case\
[0:51:51](https://youtu.be/7gAwa9i-Vrw?t=3111) they will always say aha therefore if\
[0:51:54](https://youtu.be/7gAwa9i-Vrw?t=3114) it's in common ancestry like this\
[0:51:55](https://youtu.be/7gAwa9i-Vrw?t=3115) and that's what they've done in the\
[0:51:56](https://youtu.be/7gAwa9i-Vrw?t=3116) example that you pointed out yeah\
[0:51:59](https://youtu.be/7gAwa9i-Vrw?t=3119) so i've covered this in a few videos in\
[0:52:01](https://youtu.be/7gAwa9i-Vrw?t=3121) the past but the upshot is\
[0:52:03](https://youtu.be/7gAwa9i-Vrw?t=3123) it doesn't matter what comes\
[0:52:06](https://youtu.be/7gAwa9i-Vrw?t=3126) their way something is functional\
[0:52:08](https://youtu.be/7gAwa9i-Vrw?t=3128) they'll say\
[0:52:09](https://youtu.be/7gAwa9i-Vrw?t=3129) this is designed by natural selection\
[0:52:12](https://youtu.be/7gAwa9i-Vrw?t=3132) something which is non-functional\
[0:52:14](https://youtu.be/7gAwa9i-Vrw?t=3134) this is a byproduct of natural selection\
[0:52:16](https://youtu.be/7gAwa9i-Vrw?t=3136) something which was uh\
[0:52:18](https://youtu.be/7gAwa9i-Vrw?t=3138) seen as vestigial but now is seen as\
[0:52:21](https://youtu.be/7gAwa9i-Vrw?t=3141) functional\
[0:52:22](https://youtu.be/7gAwa9i-Vrw?t=3142) they will say natural selection did it\
[0:52:24](https://youtu.be/7gAwa9i-Vrw?t=3144) that way and and just as a live example\
[0:52:26](https://youtu.be/7gAwa9i-Vrw?t=3146) for you\
[0:52:27](https://youtu.be/7gAwa9i-Vrw?t=3147) to ponder now i'm sure you're aware of\
[0:52:30](https://youtu.be/7gAwa9i-Vrw?t=3150) the recent controversy about\
[0:52:32](https://youtu.be/7gAwa9i-Vrw?t=3152) junk dna yeah now initially\
[0:52:35](https://youtu.be/7gAwa9i-Vrw?t=3155) philip kitcher who i think you referred\
[0:52:37](https://youtu.be/7gAwa9i-Vrw?t=3157) to earlier\
[0:52:39](https://youtu.be/7gAwa9i-Vrw?t=3159) uh who's referring to philip kitscher\
[0:52:40](https://youtu.be/7gAwa9i-Vrw?t=3160) somebody who's referring to philippines\
[0:52:42](https://youtu.be/7gAwa9i-Vrw?t=3162) anyway um philip kitcher you know\
[0:52:46](https://youtu.be/7gAwa9i-Vrw?t=3166) junk dna the idea that we have junk 98\
[0:52:49](https://youtu.be/7gAwa9i-Vrw?t=3169) of our dna is junk philip kitcher\
[0:52:52](https://youtu.be/7gAwa9i-Vrw?t=3172) said the majority of our dna is junk\
[0:52:56](https://youtu.be/7gAwa9i-Vrw?t=3176) and uh god needs to go back to school\
[0:52:59](https://youtu.be/7gAwa9i-Vrw?t=3179) yeah\
[0:53:00](https://youtu.be/7gAwa9i-Vrw?t=3180) i mean that that's what he was saying\
[0:53:02](https://youtu.be/7gAwa9i-Vrw?t=3182) yeah that our dna majority of his junk\
[0:53:05](https://youtu.be/7gAwa9i-Vrw?t=3185) and therefore it's you know what kind of\
[0:53:08](https://youtu.be/7gAwa9i-Vrw?t=3188) design is this he used to ridicule this\
[0:53:10](https://youtu.be/7gAwa9i-Vrw?t=3190) he's an atheist philosopher\
[0:53:12](https://youtu.be/7gAwa9i-Vrw?t=3192) now what happened was people like\
[0:53:14](https://youtu.be/7gAwa9i-Vrw?t=3194) richard dawkins\
[0:53:16](https://youtu.be/7gAwa9i-Vrw?t=3196) and and uh you know other people like\
[0:53:18](https://youtu.be/7gAwa9i-Vrw?t=3198) jerry coyne and others\
[0:53:20](https://youtu.be/7gAwa9i-Vrw?t=3200) they use junk dna you know it's\
[0:53:22](https://youtu.be/7gAwa9i-Vrw?t=3202) vestigial\
[0:53:23](https://youtu.be/7gAwa9i-Vrw?t=3203) most of our dna is junk only two percent\
[0:53:26](https://youtu.be/7gAwa9i-Vrw?t=3206) functional what kind of design is this\
[0:53:27](https://youtu.be/7gAwa9i-Vrw?t=3207) blah blah blah blah blah\
[0:53:29](https://youtu.be/7gAwa9i-Vrw?t=3209) even then i believe we could have\
[0:53:30](https://youtu.be/7gAwa9i-Vrw?t=3210) formulated an argument\
[0:53:32](https://youtu.be/7gAwa9i-Vrw?t=3212) to show that actually no it's fine\
[0:53:35](https://youtu.be/7gAwa9i-Vrw?t=3215) anyway\
[0:53:36](https://youtu.be/7gAwa9i-Vrw?t=3216) uh the encyclopedia of dna elements\
[0:53:39](https://youtu.be/7gAwa9i-Vrw?t=3219) encode they did a study they published\
[0:53:41](https://youtu.be/7gAwa9i-Vrw?t=3221) it it showed something like eighty\
[0:53:42](https://youtu.be/7gAwa9i-Vrw?t=3222) percent eighty percent of what they\
[0:53:45](https://youtu.be/7gAwa9i-Vrw?t=3225) consider to be junk\
[0:53:46](https://youtu.be/7gAwa9i-Vrw?t=3226) is not junk is actually regulatory genes\
[0:53:50](https://youtu.be/7gAwa9i-Vrw?t=3230) right it actually switches on\
[0:53:53](https://youtu.be/7gAwa9i-Vrw?t=3233) and off certain things which are related\
[0:53:55](https://youtu.be/7gAwa9i-Vrw?t=3235) to you know diabetes and\
[0:53:57](https://youtu.be/7gAwa9i-Vrw?t=3237) you know other sorts of things so now we\
[0:54:00](https://youtu.be/7gAwa9i-Vrw?t=3240) found\
[0:54:00](https://youtu.be/7gAwa9i-Vrw?t=3240) it wasn't junk it was simply we had no\
[0:54:03](https://youtu.be/7gAwa9i-Vrw?t=3243) idea how complicated it was\
[0:54:05](https://youtu.be/7gAwa9i-Vrw?t=3245) wow then in an interview uh the former\
[0:54:08](https://youtu.be/7gAwa9i-Vrw?t=3248) rabbi uh of uh\
[0:54:12](https://youtu.be/7gAwa9i-Vrw?t=3252) the grand rabbi i'm not sure what they\
[0:54:13](https://youtu.be/7gAwa9i-Vrw?t=3253) call him of the uk he's a he's a\
[0:54:16](https://youtu.be/7gAwa9i-Vrw?t=3256) oxford what's his name jonathan sacks\
[0:54:18](https://youtu.be/7gAwa9i-Vrw?t=3258) yes\
[0:54:19](https://youtu.be/7gAwa9i-Vrw?t=3259) he's the main guy yeah yeah yeah so he\
[0:54:21](https://youtu.be/7gAwa9i-Vrw?t=3261) he's passed away and now it's another\
[0:54:23](https://youtu.be/7gAwa9i-Vrw?t=3263) guy\
[0:54:23](https://youtu.be/7gAwa9i-Vrw?t=3263) in charge but anyway this guy is a\
[0:54:24](https://youtu.be/7gAwa9i-Vrw?t=3264) philosopher from oxford university\
[0:54:26](https://youtu.be/7gAwa9i-Vrw?t=3266) he's really smart guy he was in a debate\
[0:54:28](https://youtu.be/7gAwa9i-Vrw?t=3268) with richard dawkins\
[0:54:30](https://youtu.be/7gAwa9i-Vrw?t=3270) he used this he said look you guys were\
[0:54:33](https://youtu.be/7gAwa9i-Vrw?t=3273) saying this\
[0:54:34](https://youtu.be/7gAwa9i-Vrw?t=3274) yes right and now it's turned out it's\
[0:54:36](https://youtu.be/7gAwa9i-Vrw?t=3276) functional and original\
[0:54:39](https://youtu.be/7gAwa9i-Vrw?t=3279) yes that's the one yeah and then what\
[0:54:40](https://youtu.be/7gAwa9i-Vrw?t=3280) richard dawkins says to him is\
[0:54:42](https://youtu.be/7gAwa9i-Vrw?t=3282) yeah but of course we would expect\
[0:54:45](https://youtu.be/7gAwa9i-Vrw?t=3285) natural selection to get rid of the junk\
[0:54:48](https://youtu.be/7gAwa9i-Vrw?t=3288) and the dna would be functional\
[0:54:49](https://youtu.be/7gAwa9i-Vrw?t=3289) but that's the exact opposite what the\
[0:54:51](https://youtu.be/7gAwa9i-Vrw?t=3291) darwinists were saying before so the\
[0:54:52](https://youtu.be/7gAwa9i-Vrw?t=3292) problem is the paradigm\
[0:54:54](https://youtu.be/7gAwa9i-Vrw?t=3294) yeah this is what kuhn speaks about yeah\
[0:54:56](https://youtu.be/7gAwa9i-Vrw?t=3296) right the paradigm\
[0:54:58](https://youtu.be/7gAwa9i-Vrw?t=3298) it makes you look at every anomaly\
[0:55:00](https://youtu.be/7gAwa9i-Vrw?t=3300) anomaly and reverse engineer it\
[0:55:02](https://youtu.be/7gAwa9i-Vrw?t=3302) ad hoc rationalize it and give it as a\
[0:55:04](https://youtu.be/7gAwa9i-Vrw?t=3304) confirmation right right right\
[0:55:06](https://youtu.be/7gAwa9i-Vrw?t=3306) and that's what's happening so something\
[0:55:07](https://youtu.be/7gAwa9i-Vrw?t=3307) so he just changed he just changed his\
[0:55:09](https://youtu.be/7gAwa9i-Vrw?t=3309) passion\
[0:55:09](https://youtu.be/7gAwa9i-Vrw?t=3309) from one from one and he goes and you go\
[0:55:11](https://youtu.be/7gAwa9i-Vrw?t=3311) back to school and he was like yeah it's\
[0:55:13](https://youtu.be/7gAwa9i-Vrw?t=3313) all just\
[0:55:14](https://youtu.be/7gAwa9i-Vrw?t=3314) that phillip kitchen but same same\
[0:55:15](https://youtu.be/7gAwa9i-Vrw?t=3315) people right the same way he was using\
[0:55:17](https://youtu.be/7gAwa9i-Vrw?t=3317) the stuff right same stuff\
[0:55:18](https://youtu.be/7gAwa9i-Vrw?t=3318) and now he's saying no it's actually\
[0:55:19](https://youtu.be/7gAwa9i-Vrw?t=3319) what we expect this anyways but this is\
[0:55:21](https://youtu.be/7gAwa9i-Vrw?t=3321) not as bad\
[0:55:22](https://youtu.be/7gAwa9i-Vrw?t=3322) it's not as bad as pizza myers yes\
[0:55:25](https://youtu.be/7gAwa9i-Vrw?t=3325) he's admirers instead of actually\
[0:55:28](https://youtu.be/7gAwa9i-Vrw?t=3328) saying what richard dawkins said which\
[0:55:30](https://youtu.be/7gAwa9i-Vrw?t=3330) by the way from their materialistic\
[0:55:32](https://youtu.be/7gAwa9i-Vrw?t=3332) point of view yeah i agree with them\
[0:55:34](https://youtu.be/7gAwa9i-Vrw?t=3334) that from your materialistic point of\
[0:55:36](https://youtu.be/7gAwa9i-Vrw?t=3336) view you can give that answer\
[0:55:39](https://youtu.be/7gAwa9i-Vrw?t=3339) the answer is that before he was junk\
[0:55:41](https://youtu.be/7gAwa9i-Vrw?t=3341) now they say\
[0:55:42](https://youtu.be/7gAwa9i-Vrw?t=3342) natural selection got rid of the job so\
[0:55:45](https://youtu.be/7gAwa9i-Vrw?t=3345) they try and say of course natural\
[0:55:47](https://youtu.be/7gAwa9i-Vrw?t=3347) selection wouldn't keep 98 percent of\
[0:55:49](https://youtu.be/7gAwa9i-Vrw?t=3349) your dna's junk how inefficient is that\
[0:55:51](https://youtu.be/7gAwa9i-Vrw?t=3351) natural reflection obviously you're\
[0:55:52](https://youtu.be/7gAwa9i-Vrw?t=3352) going to get\
[0:55:52](https://youtu.be/7gAwa9i-Vrw?t=3352) what's he saying yeah\
[0:55:56](https://youtu.be/7gAwa9i-Vrw?t=3356) he's an embryologist yeah okay so it's\
[0:55:58](https://youtu.be/7gAwa9i-Vrw?t=3358) not even his\
[0:55:59](https://youtu.be/7gAwa9i-Vrw?t=3359) field we're talking about genetics he\
[0:56:02](https://youtu.be/7gAwa9i-Vrw?t=3362) challenged the entire study\
[0:56:04](https://youtu.be/7gAwa9i-Vrw?t=3364) he challenged their definition of\
[0:56:05](https://youtu.be/7gAwa9i-Vrw?t=3365) functional and he just started attacking\
[0:56:07](https://youtu.be/7gAwa9i-Vrw?t=3367) all of the scientists\
[0:56:12](https://youtu.be/7gAwa9i-Vrw?t=3372) an end code just a\
[0:56:19](https://youtu.be/7gAwa9i-Vrw?t=3379) it's called bad biology yeah so he said\
[0:56:22](https://youtu.be/7gAwa9i-Vrw?t=3382) myers just started attacking the\
[0:56:24](https://youtu.be/7gAwa9i-Vrw?t=3384) scientists\
[0:56:25](https://youtu.be/7gAwa9i-Vrw?t=3385) saying how they're doing shoddy science\
[0:56:26](https://youtu.be/7gAwa9i-Vrw?t=3386) now what's very interesting is he just\
[0:56:28](https://youtu.be/7gAwa9i-Vrw?t=3388) attacks anyone\
[0:56:29](https://youtu.be/7gAwa9i-Vrw?t=3389) n code this is a study that was done\
[0:56:33](https://youtu.be/7gAwa9i-Vrw?t=3393) yeah encode uh encyclopedia of dna\
[0:56:36](https://youtu.be/7gAwa9i-Vrw?t=3396) encode yeah yeah\
[0:56:36](https://youtu.be/7gAwa9i-Vrw?t=3396) encode yeah so these people\
[0:56:40](https://youtu.be/7gAwa9i-Vrw?t=3400) their study was not funded by some\
[0:56:43](https://youtu.be/7gAwa9i-Vrw?t=3403) creationist institute\
[0:56:44](https://youtu.be/7gAwa9i-Vrw?t=3404) these were top scientists from around\
[0:56:46](https://youtu.be/7gAwa9i-Vrw?t=3406) the world top scientists from america\
[0:56:49](https://youtu.be/7gAwa9i-Vrw?t=3409) no re they did not know that them\
[0:56:52](https://youtu.be/7gAwa9i-Vrw?t=3412) publishing this story is going to\
[0:56:56](https://youtu.be/7gAwa9i-Vrw?t=3416) make them enter a theological\
[0:56:59](https://youtu.be/7gAwa9i-Vrw?t=3419) hornet's nest they were simply just\
[0:57:01](https://youtu.be/7gAwa9i-Vrw?t=3421) doing science\
[0:57:02](https://youtu.be/7gAwa9i-Vrw?t=3422) now it's very interesting is when i was\
[0:57:04](https://youtu.be/7gAwa9i-Vrw?t=3424) doing my masters\
[0:57:06](https://youtu.be/7gAwa9i-Vrw?t=3426) my dissertation was actually related to\
[0:57:09](https://youtu.be/7gAwa9i-Vrw?t=3429) how darwinism leads to false positives\
[0:57:13](https://youtu.be/7gAwa9i-Vrw?t=3433) how it stops research one of the things\
[0:57:16](https://youtu.be/7gAwa9i-Vrw?t=3436) which i did\
[0:57:17](https://youtu.be/7gAwa9i-Vrw?t=3437) um and inshallah i'm going to put this\
[0:57:19](https://youtu.be/7gAwa9i-Vrw?t=3439) on my website sugrahma.com my\
[0:57:20](https://youtu.be/7gAwa9i-Vrw?t=3440) dissertation\
[0:57:22](https://youtu.be/7gAwa9i-Vrw?t=3442) i showed how darwinis\
[0:57:25](https://youtu.be/7gAwa9i-Vrw?t=3445) were actively stopping dna\
[0:57:29](https://youtu.be/7gAwa9i-Vrw?t=3449) being investigated as being functional\
[0:57:32](https://youtu.be/7gAwa9i-Vrw?t=3452) because they said it's a waste of time\
[0:57:35](https://youtu.be/7gAwa9i-Vrw?t=3455) so they were hindering the progress of\
[0:57:37](https://youtu.be/7gAwa9i-Vrw?t=3457) science\
[0:57:38](https://youtu.be/7gAwa9i-Vrw?t=3458) their assumptions were hindering the\
[0:57:40](https://youtu.be/7gAwa9i-Vrw?t=3460) progress of science now we know about\
[0:57:42](https://youtu.be/7gAwa9i-Vrw?t=3462) the\
[0:57:42](https://youtu.be/7gAwa9i-Vrw?t=3462) yeah now we know about this stuff about\
[0:57:44](https://youtu.be/7gAwa9i-Vrw?t=3464) dna and stuff\
[0:57:45](https://youtu.be/7gAwa9i-Vrw?t=3465) uh the functional stuff and the\
[0:57:47](https://youtu.be/7gAwa9i-Vrw?t=3467) regulatory function of it\
[0:57:49](https://youtu.be/7gAwa9i-Vrw?t=3469) this will help us solve things related\
[0:57:52](https://youtu.be/7gAwa9i-Vrw?t=3472) to cancer\
[0:57:53](https://youtu.be/7gAwa9i-Vrw?t=3473) diabetes and other conditions wow\
[0:57:56](https://youtu.be/7gAwa9i-Vrw?t=3476) however\
[0:57:58](https://youtu.be/7gAwa9i-Vrw?t=3478) what is it going to show you shows you\
[0:57:59](https://youtu.be/7gAwa9i-Vrw?t=3479) darwinism itself was stopping science\
[0:58:02](https://youtu.be/7gAwa9i-Vrw?t=3482) wow\
[0:58:03](https://youtu.be/7gAwa9i-Vrw?t=3483) wow wow how come we haven't read this\
[0:58:05](https://youtu.be/7gAwa9i-Vrw?t=3485) before\
[0:58:06](https://youtu.be/7gAwa9i-Vrw?t=3486) yeah oh you're\
[0:58:21](https://youtu.be/7gAwa9i-Vrw?t=3501) whatever his name is he gave me a very\
[0:58:24](https://youtu.be/7gAwa9i-Vrw?t=3504) high distinction for this\
[0:58:26](https://youtu.be/7gAwa9i-Vrw?t=3506) and when i got this review by an\
[0:58:28](https://youtu.be/7gAwa9i-Vrw?t=3508) academic he actually said this is the\
[0:58:29](https://youtu.be/7gAwa9i-Vrw?t=3509) best thing\
[0:58:30](https://youtu.be/7gAwa9i-Vrw?t=3510) he's read yeah so it's not for me it's\
[0:58:33](https://youtu.be/7gAwa9i-Vrw?t=3513) alhamdulillah from allah but\
[0:58:34](https://youtu.be/7gAwa9i-Vrw?t=3514) it just goes to show you how darwinism\
[0:58:37](https://youtu.be/7gAwa9i-Vrw?t=3517) is a science stopper\
[0:58:40](https://youtu.be/7gAwa9i-Vrw?t=3520) regardless of french muslims i don't\
[0:58:43](https://youtu.be/7gAwa9i-Vrw?t=3523) think you that i don't think you require\
[0:58:45](https://youtu.be/7gAwa9i-Vrw?t=3525) i mean you could have gotten a better\
[0:58:46](https://youtu.be/7gAwa9i-Vrw?t=3526) noise but better answer than that\
[0:58:50](https://youtu.be/7gAwa9i-Vrw?t=3530) i i just i just have an answer uh to to\
[0:58:53](https://youtu.be/7gAwa9i-Vrw?t=3533) to bring\
[0:58:53](https://youtu.be/7gAwa9i-Vrw?t=3533) regarding the dna example and the\
[0:58:56](https://youtu.be/7gAwa9i-Vrw?t=3536) palmaris longus\
[0:58:57](https://youtu.be/7gAwa9i-Vrw?t=3537) example is it not slightly different\
[0:58:59](https://youtu.be/7gAwa9i-Vrw?t=3539) because the the muscle is not present in\
[0:59:01](https://youtu.be/7gAwa9i-Vrw?t=3541) every human being\
[0:59:14](https://youtu.be/7gAwa9i-Vrw?t=3554) supposedly universal this example that\
[0:59:16](https://youtu.be/7gAwa9i-Vrw?t=3556) he gave is particular\
[0:59:18](https://youtu.be/7gAwa9i-Vrw?t=3558) which was yeah about the muscles and\
[0:59:20](https://youtu.be/7gAwa9i-Vrw?t=3560) about the\
[0:59:21](https://youtu.be/7gAwa9i-Vrw?t=3561) muscle you're right in terms of\
[0:59:24](https://youtu.be/7gAwa9i-Vrw?t=3564) statistical data but in terms of\
[0:59:27](https://youtu.be/7gAwa9i-Vrw?t=3567) the concepts which i described with the\
[0:59:29](https://youtu.be/7gAwa9i-Vrw?t=3569) first natives and that is the same\
[0:59:32](https://youtu.be/7gAwa9i-Vrw?t=3572) but is there no distinction between the\
[0:59:35](https://youtu.be/7gAwa9i-Vrw?t=3575) the expectation we can give\
[0:59:36](https://youtu.be/7gAwa9i-Vrw?t=3576) as uh is it relevant to to insert the\
[0:59:39](https://youtu.be/7gAwa9i-Vrw?t=3579) palmaris longus cases uh by uh\
[0:59:41](https://youtu.be/7gAwa9i-Vrw?t=3581) giving the concept with junk dna the\
[0:59:43](https://youtu.be/7gAwa9i-Vrw?t=3583) thing is\
[0:59:45](https://youtu.be/7gAwa9i-Vrw?t=3585) i wouldn't see it as a relevant\
[0:59:47](https://youtu.be/7gAwa9i-Vrw?t=3587) difference\
[0:59:48](https://youtu.be/7gAwa9i-Vrw?t=3588) yeah so you're right the junk dna that's\
[0:59:51](https://youtu.be/7gAwa9i-Vrw?t=3591) present in everyone\
[0:59:52](https://youtu.be/7gAwa9i-Vrw?t=3592) but as the concept the fact that a\
[0:59:55](https://youtu.be/7gAwa9i-Vrw?t=3595) vestigial organ\
[0:59:56](https://youtu.be/7gAwa9i-Vrw?t=3596) if it's true it can fit within a\
[0:59:59](https://youtu.be/7gAwa9i-Vrw?t=3599) theistic paradigm\
[1:00:00](https://youtu.be/7gAwa9i-Vrw?t=3600) and also that they using a materialistic\
[1:00:03](https://youtu.be/7gAwa9i-Vrw?t=3603) paradigm will always reverse engineer it\
[1:00:06](https://youtu.be/7gAwa9i-Vrw?t=3606) these things are are concepts that apply\
[1:00:09](https://youtu.be/7gAwa9i-Vrw?t=3609) to your example and to the jungle dna\
[1:00:11](https://youtu.be/7gAwa9i-Vrw?t=3611) example\
[1:00:12](https://youtu.be/7gAwa9i-Vrw?t=3612) they are okay so we don't need to\
[1:00:14](https://youtu.be/7gAwa9i-Vrw?t=3614) explain it\
[1:00:15](https://youtu.be/7gAwa9i-Vrw?t=3615) uh it is not relevant yeah\
[1:00:19](https://youtu.be/7gAwa9i-Vrw?t=3619) also something else which is i think is\
[1:00:20](https://youtu.be/7gAwa9i-Vrw?t=3620) very important uh my by the way what's\
[1:00:22](https://youtu.be/7gAwa9i-Vrw?t=3622) your name\
[1:00:23](https://youtu.be/7gAwa9i-Vrw?t=3623) uh marwan we told you an email for a\
[1:00:25](https://youtu.be/7gAwa9i-Vrw?t=3625) wiggler research\
[1:00:26](https://youtu.be/7gAwa9i-Vrw?t=3626) uh you know so you say that again uh you\
[1:00:29](https://youtu.be/7gAwa9i-Vrw?t=3629) said you\
[1:00:30](https://youtu.be/7gAwa9i-Vrw?t=3630) on twitter you you've been searching\
[1:00:32](https://youtu.be/7gAwa9i-Vrw?t=3632) someone for for a research project\
[1:00:33](https://youtu.be/7gAwa9i-Vrw?t=3633) project for the\
[1:00:34](https://youtu.be/7gAwa9i-Vrw?t=3634) rigors i've applied like uh two weeks\
[1:00:37](https://youtu.be/7gAwa9i-Vrw?t=3637) ago\
[1:00:37](https://youtu.be/7gAwa9i-Vrw?t=3637) that's me yes yes you emailed me i\
[1:00:40](https://youtu.be/7gAwa9i-Vrw?t=3640) believe yeah yeah yeah but that's\
[1:00:42](https://youtu.be/7gAwa9i-Vrw?t=3642) another subject it's all right\
[1:00:44](https://youtu.be/7gAwa9i-Vrw?t=3644) yeah it's not a martial brother uh uh\
[1:00:46](https://youtu.be/7gAwa9i-Vrw?t=3646) what's it called can you just re-email\
[1:00:48](https://youtu.be/7gAwa9i-Vrw?t=3648) me so your email comes at the top and we\
[1:00:50](https://youtu.be/7gAwa9i-Vrw?t=3650) will take it from there\
[1:00:51](https://youtu.be/7gAwa9i-Vrw?t=3651) now the thing is um i was just about to\
[1:00:53](https://youtu.be/7gAwa9i-Vrw?t=3653) say yeah\
[1:00:54](https://youtu.be/7gAwa9i-Vrw?t=3654) this is very important yeah everything\
[1:00:57](https://youtu.be/7gAwa9i-Vrw?t=3657) i'm saying to you on this live stream\
[1:00:58](https://youtu.be/7gAwa9i-Vrw?t=3658) and everyone watching now\
[1:01:00](https://youtu.be/7gAwa9i-Vrw?t=3660) i just want everybody to recognize\
[1:01:02](https://youtu.be/7gAwa9i-Vrw?t=3662) something none of this\
[1:01:04](https://youtu.be/7gAwa9i-Vrw?t=3664) is a scientific argument what i always\
[1:01:07](https://youtu.be/7gAwa9i-Vrw?t=3667) try and do\
[1:01:08](https://youtu.be/7gAwa9i-Vrw?t=3668) and i learned this from hamza sauces\
[1:01:10](https://youtu.be/7gAwa9i-Vrw?t=3670) many years ago when it came to evolution\
[1:01:12](https://youtu.be/7gAwa9i-Vrw?t=3672) narrative\
[1:01:13](https://youtu.be/7gAwa9i-Vrw?t=3673) is to give philosophical concepts which\
[1:01:15](https://youtu.be/7gAwa9i-Vrw?t=3675) could be applied\
[1:01:16](https://youtu.be/7gAwa9i-Vrw?t=3676) to whichever scientific information is\
[1:01:18](https://youtu.be/7gAwa9i-Vrw?t=3678) coming out\
[1:01:19](https://youtu.be/7gAwa9i-Vrw?t=3679) so sometimes what happens is i've given\
[1:01:22](https://youtu.be/7gAwa9i-Vrw?t=3682) this example of junk dna\
[1:01:24](https://youtu.be/7gAwa9i-Vrw?t=3684) or we've covered this particular example\
[1:01:26](https://youtu.be/7gAwa9i-Vrw?t=3686) about the muscles\
[1:01:28](https://youtu.be/7gAwa9i-Vrw?t=3688) the issue is sometimes people an atheist\
[1:01:31](https://youtu.be/7gAwa9i-Vrw?t=3691) sometimes what they do is they bring the\
[1:01:33](https://youtu.be/7gAwa9i-Vrw?t=3693) new information about vestigial organs\
[1:01:35](https://youtu.be/7gAwa9i-Vrw?t=3695) and they say aha\
[1:01:36](https://youtu.be/7gAwa9i-Vrw?t=3696) i have something new but that's\
[1:01:38](https://youtu.be/7gAwa9i-Vrw?t=3698) irrelevant because the concepts which\
[1:01:40](https://youtu.be/7gAwa9i-Vrw?t=3700) i'm giving\
[1:01:41](https://youtu.be/7gAwa9i-Vrw?t=3701) are timeless they're irrelevant it's\
[1:01:43](https://youtu.be/7gAwa9i-Vrw?t=3703) irrelevant if that information came out\
[1:01:45](https://youtu.be/7gAwa9i-Vrw?t=3705) now\
[1:01:46](https://youtu.be/7gAwa9i-Vrw?t=3706) or if they came out 20 years ago yeah so\
[1:01:48](https://youtu.be/7gAwa9i-Vrw?t=3708) i think that's very important because\
[1:01:49](https://youtu.be/7gAwa9i-Vrw?t=3709) sometimes when i speak it's it's a bit\
[1:01:52](https://youtu.be/7gAwa9i-Vrw?t=3712) scientifically heavy\
[1:01:53](https://youtu.be/7gAwa9i-Vrw?t=3713) so it looks like i'm making a scientific\
[1:01:56](https://youtu.be/7gAwa9i-Vrw?t=3716) argument when i'm not making a\
[1:01:57](https://youtu.be/7gAwa9i-Vrw?t=3717) scientific argument\
[1:01:58](https://youtu.be/7gAwa9i-Vrw?t=3718) also the junk dna example\
[1:02:02](https://youtu.be/7gAwa9i-Vrw?t=3722) even if i never had that example the\
[1:02:04](https://youtu.be/7gAwa9i-Vrw?t=3724) concept would still be correct\
[1:02:06](https://youtu.be/7gAwa9i-Vrw?t=3726) yeah and you think that's relevant um\
[1:02:08](https://youtu.be/7gAwa9i-Vrw?t=3728) despite there is this\
[1:02:09](https://youtu.be/7gAwa9i-Vrw?t=3729) universal versus particular occurrence\
[1:02:13](https://youtu.be/7gAwa9i-Vrw?t=3733) it wouldn't make a difference because um\
[1:02:16](https://youtu.be/7gAwa9i-Vrw?t=3736) the particular\
[1:02:17](https://youtu.be/7gAwa9i-Vrw?t=3737) and the universal still fit within the\
[1:02:19](https://youtu.be/7gAwa9i-Vrw?t=3739) philosophy of biology and these are\
[1:02:21](https://youtu.be/7gAwa9i-Vrw?t=3741) philosophical these are arguments from\
[1:02:22](https://youtu.be/7gAwa9i-Vrw?t=3742) the philosophical\
[1:02:23](https://youtu.be/7gAwa9i-Vrw?t=3743) point of view because i mean yeah these\
[1:02:26](https://youtu.be/7gAwa9i-Vrw?t=3746) arguments in a way\
[1:02:27](https://youtu.be/7gAwa9i-Vrw?t=3747) are meta level i'm going to take this\
[1:02:29](https://youtu.be/7gAwa9i-Vrw?t=3749) part of what you just said and i'm going\
[1:02:31](https://youtu.be/7gAwa9i-Vrw?t=3751) to put it on my channel\
[1:02:35](https://youtu.be/7gAwa9i-Vrw?t=3755) i want to get the quote of uh what's his\
[1:02:36](https://youtu.be/7gAwa9i-Vrw?t=3756) name man philipp kitchen\
[1:02:38](https://youtu.be/7gAwa9i-Vrw?t=3758) yeah philip kitcher and if uh please\
[1:02:40](https://youtu.be/7gAwa9i-Vrw?t=3760) admire bro\
[1:02:41](https://youtu.be/7gAwa9i-Vrw?t=3761) that's but you have to publish i think\
[1:02:44](https://youtu.be/7gAwa9i-Vrw?t=3764) people would agree with me that\
[1:02:45](https://youtu.be/7gAwa9i-Vrw?t=3765) you have to publish your dissertation\
[1:02:54](https://youtu.be/7gAwa9i-Vrw?t=3774) and if i have a suggestion uh suggestion\
[1:02:56](https://youtu.be/7gAwa9i-Vrw?t=3776) for a serpent institute\
[1:02:57](https://youtu.be/7gAwa9i-Vrw?t=3777) i think that what's happening in france\
[1:02:59](https://youtu.be/7gAwa9i-Vrw?t=3779) is a very a very big issue in\
[1:03:02](https://youtu.be/7gAwa9i-Vrw?t=3782) the muslim world you know what i think\
[1:03:04](https://youtu.be/7gAwa9i-Vrw?t=3784) what's big in front what's happening\
[1:03:05](https://youtu.be/7gAwa9i-Vrw?t=3785) uh the islamophobia phenomenon which is\
[1:03:08](https://youtu.be/7gAwa9i-Vrw?t=3788) started by the politics and all that\
[1:03:09](https://youtu.be/7gAwa9i-Vrw?t=3789) stuff i think that's a very important uh\
[1:03:12](https://youtu.be/7gAwa9i-Vrw?t=3792) thing to to deal with and maybe stop\
[1:03:13](https://youtu.be/7gAwa9i-Vrw?t=3793) institut can\
[1:03:15](https://youtu.be/7gAwa9i-Vrw?t=3795) deal with it because there is a lot of\
[1:03:17](https://youtu.be/7gAwa9i-Vrw?t=3797) um you know rhetoric about islam\
[1:03:20](https://youtu.be/7gAwa9i-Vrw?t=3800) and uh bombing and all that stuff which\
[1:03:22](https://youtu.be/7gAwa9i-Vrw?t=3802) is used by by politics\
[1:03:24](https://youtu.be/7gAwa9i-Vrw?t=3804) it's uh maybe that france is like a\
[1:03:26](https://youtu.be/7gAwa9i-Vrw?t=3806) laboratory\
[1:03:27](https://youtu.be/7gAwa9i-Vrw?t=3807) uh maybe that things that will happen in\
[1:03:29](https://youtu.be/7gAwa9i-Vrw?t=3809) the future in in\
[1:03:31](https://youtu.be/7gAwa9i-Vrw?t=3811) at a global scale maybe that are\
[1:03:33](https://youtu.be/7gAwa9i-Vrw?t=3813) happening now in france\
[1:03:34](https://youtu.be/7gAwa9i-Vrw?t=3814) uh so i think that studying the french\
[1:03:36](https://youtu.be/7gAwa9i-Vrw?t=3816) case regarding islamophobia\
[1:03:37](https://youtu.be/7gAwa9i-Vrw?t=3817) is very important just to clarify i mean\
[1:03:40](https://youtu.be/7gAwa9i-Vrw?t=3820) muhammad hijab in terms of his\
[1:03:43](https://youtu.be/7gAwa9i-Vrw?t=3823) public uh profile and using his uh\
[1:03:46](https://youtu.be/7gAwa9i-Vrw?t=3826) social media presence and myself\
[1:03:48](https://youtu.be/7gAwa9i-Vrw?t=3828) independently of sapiens we can say\
[1:03:50](https://youtu.be/7gAwa9i-Vrw?t=3830) stuff\
[1:03:51](https://youtu.be/7gAwa9i-Vrw?t=3831) but because of safety clarity status we\
[1:03:54](https://youtu.be/7gAwa9i-Vrw?t=3834) don't make anything\
[1:03:55](https://youtu.be/7gAwa9i-Vrw?t=3835) political because that's not allowed\
[1:03:58](https://youtu.be/7gAwa9i-Vrw?t=3838) right when you're working on a charity\
[1:04:00](https://youtu.be/7gAwa9i-Vrw?t=3840) but definitely\
[1:04:01](https://youtu.be/7gAwa9i-Vrw?t=3841) i mean we do sympathize it is whatever's\
[1:04:04](https://youtu.be/7gAwa9i-Vrw?t=3844) happening in france will\
[1:04:06](https://youtu.be/7gAwa9i-Vrw?t=3846) you know it's a blueprint for the rest\
[1:04:08](https://youtu.be/7gAwa9i-Vrw?t=3848) of europe\
[1:04:09](https://youtu.be/7gAwa9i-Vrw?t=3849) well barcelona\
[1:04:16](https://youtu.be/7gAwa9i-Vrw?t=3856) okay next is brother proving islam\
[1:04:23](https://youtu.be/7gAwa9i-Vrw?t=3863) salam alaykum\
[1:04:27](https://youtu.be/7gAwa9i-Vrw?t=3867) this is my it's my youtube channel's\
[1:04:29](https://youtu.be/7gAwa9i-Vrw?t=3869) name which is why it's like this but um\
[1:04:32](https://youtu.be/7gAwa9i-Vrw?t=3872) yeah so i wanted to uh discuss\
[1:04:35](https://youtu.be/7gAwa9i-Vrw?t=3875) like uh like the main things you were\
[1:04:39](https://youtu.be/7gAwa9i-Vrw?t=3879) talking about\
[1:04:40](https://youtu.be/7gAwa9i-Vrw?t=3880) like the reason that sapien institute\
[1:04:42](https://youtu.be/7gAwa9i-Vrw?t=3882) you guys started it was to give\
[1:04:44](https://youtu.be/7gAwa9i-Vrw?t=3884) arguments for islam\
[1:04:46](https://youtu.be/7gAwa9i-Vrw?t=3886) right so to me\
[1:04:49](https://youtu.be/7gAwa9i-Vrw?t=3889) the greatest proof for islam is actually\
[1:04:52](https://youtu.be/7gAwa9i-Vrw?t=3892) the theology itself\
[1:04:55](https://youtu.be/7gAwa9i-Vrw?t=3895) so i think if you read the quran like\
[1:04:57](https://youtu.be/7gAwa9i-Vrw?t=3897) this is the thing which shows up like\
[1:04:59](https://youtu.be/7gAwa9i-Vrw?t=3899) all the time right most of the quran is\
[1:05:01](https://youtu.be/7gAwa9i-Vrw?t=3901) just self-evident\
[1:05:03](https://youtu.be/7gAwa9i-Vrw?t=3903) based on the linguistics and\
[1:05:06](https://youtu.be/7gAwa9i-Vrw?t=3906) just the message like a lot like that's\
[1:05:08](https://youtu.be/7gAwa9i-Vrw?t=3908) why allah always repeats this idea of\
[1:05:11](https://youtu.be/7gAwa9i-Vrw?t=3911) don't you will you not remember etc etc\
[1:05:14](https://youtu.be/7gAwa9i-Vrw?t=3914) so to me that's the uh strongest\
[1:05:17](https://youtu.be/7gAwa9i-Vrw?t=3917) argument for islam just looking\
[1:05:21](https://youtu.be/7gAwa9i-Vrw?t=3921) at its theology and then comparing it to\
[1:05:24](https://youtu.be/7gAwa9i-Vrw?t=3924) all the shirk and kuffar and this and\
[1:05:26](https://youtu.be/7gAwa9i-Vrw?t=3926) that right so like\
[1:05:28](https://youtu.be/7gAwa9i-Vrw?t=3928) christianity is so obviously false uh\
[1:05:31](https://youtu.be/7gAwa9i-Vrw?t=3931) it makes no sense uh the atheism is\
[1:05:35](https://youtu.be/7gAwa9i-Vrw?t=3935) so obviously false um idolatry\
[1:05:38](https://youtu.be/7gAwa9i-Vrw?t=3938) like idol worship etc but the one\
[1:05:42](https://youtu.be/7gAwa9i-Vrw?t=3942) religion which\
[1:05:42](https://youtu.be/7gAwa9i-Vrw?t=3942) uh i haven't seen as much content on\
[1:05:46](https://youtu.be/7gAwa9i-Vrw?t=3946) is judaism because people tend to\
[1:05:50](https://youtu.be/7gAwa9i-Vrw?t=3950) believe that\
[1:05:51](https://youtu.be/7gAwa9i-Vrw?t=3951) judaism and islam is the same in terms\
[1:05:54](https://youtu.be/7gAwa9i-Vrw?t=3954) of its\
[1:05:55](https://youtu.be/7gAwa9i-Vrw?t=3955) main concepts so you'll see people like\
[1:05:58](https://youtu.be/7gAwa9i-Vrw?t=3958) um\
[1:05:59](https://youtu.be/7gAwa9i-Vrw?t=3959) sorry i'm just going to turn off my fan\
[1:06:00](https://youtu.be/7gAwa9i-Vrw?t=3960) here so you can hear me better but uh so\
[1:06:02](https://youtu.be/7gAwa9i-Vrw?t=3962) i can hear you okay so like um\
[1:06:06](https://youtu.be/7gAwa9i-Vrw?t=3966) you know uh i'm sure you guys are\
[1:06:07](https://youtu.be/7gAwa9i-Vrw?t=3967) familiar with rabbi tovia singer\
[1:06:09](https://youtu.be/7gAwa9i-Vrw?t=3969) so yeah yeah so that's like the popular\
[1:06:12](https://youtu.be/7gAwa9i-Vrw?t=3972) version of judaism\
[1:06:13](https://youtu.be/7gAwa9i-Vrw?t=3973) out there and to me like if if\
[1:06:17](https://youtu.be/7gAwa9i-Vrw?t=3977) there is a bit of a problem with that in\
[1:06:19](https://youtu.be/7gAwa9i-Vrw?t=3979) that it sort of hinders our argument\
[1:06:21](https://youtu.be/7gAwa9i-Vrw?t=3981) because it makes it seem like\
[1:06:23](https://youtu.be/7gAwa9i-Vrw?t=3983) like imagine how strong an argument it\
[1:06:26](https://youtu.be/7gAwa9i-Vrw?t=3986) is to say islam is the only monotheistic\
[1:06:28](https://youtu.be/7gAwa9i-Vrw?t=3988) religion right\
[1:06:29](https://youtu.be/7gAwa9i-Vrw?t=3989) but now if you include judaism in that\
[1:06:31](https://youtu.be/7gAwa9i-Vrw?t=3991) then you sort of got like two\
[1:06:34](https://youtu.be/7gAwa9i-Vrw?t=3994) you know so i started noticing this\
[1:06:36](https://youtu.be/7gAwa9i-Vrw?t=3996) problem because\
[1:06:37](https://youtu.be/7gAwa9i-Vrw?t=3997) uh it was brought to my attention that\
[1:06:39](https://youtu.be/7gAwa9i-Vrw?t=3999) there are actually muslims who were\
[1:06:40](https://youtu.be/7gAwa9i-Vrw?t=4000) becoming noahides\
[1:06:43](https://youtu.be/7gAwa9i-Vrw?t=4003) in his comment section and this and that\
[1:06:45](https://youtu.be/7gAwa9i-Vrw?t=4005) so\
[1:06:46](https://youtu.be/7gAwa9i-Vrw?t=4006) uh i think it's actually very important\
[1:06:48](https://youtu.be/7gAwa9i-Vrw?t=4008) to\
[1:06:50](https://youtu.be/7gAwa9i-Vrw?t=4010) because i like i would suppose that\
[1:06:52](https://youtu.be/7gAwa9i-Vrw?t=4012) you're gonna make this argument\
[1:06:54](https://youtu.be/7gAwa9i-Vrw?t=4014) uh on sapien institute because it is one\
[1:06:56](https://youtu.be/7gAwa9i-Vrw?t=4016) of the main arguments of the quran right\
[1:06:58](https://youtu.be/7gAwa9i-Vrw?t=4018) yeah so it is a very so i would expect\
[1:07:00](https://youtu.be/7gAwa9i-Vrw?t=4020) that so uh i would say that\
[1:07:01](https://youtu.be/7gAwa9i-Vrw?t=4021) it's important also to address judaism\
[1:07:04](https://youtu.be/7gAwa9i-Vrw?t=4024) because i've actually seen\
[1:07:05](https://youtu.be/7gAwa9i-Vrw?t=4025) brother muhammad hijab make a video on\
[1:07:07](https://youtu.be/7gAwa9i-Vrw?t=4027) this he was asked this question once on\
[1:07:10](https://youtu.be/7gAwa9i-Vrw?t=4030) like salaam or\
[1:07:11](https://youtu.be/7gAwa9i-Vrw?t=4031) channel or something and he mentioned\
[1:07:14](https://youtu.be/7gAwa9i-Vrw?t=4034) how\
[1:07:15](https://youtu.be/7gAwa9i-Vrw?t=4035) the jewish goddess weak god and he\
[1:07:17](https://youtu.be/7gAwa9i-Vrw?t=4037) regrets and this and that\
[1:07:18](https://youtu.be/7gAwa9i-Vrw?t=4038) but actually i think it's very important\
[1:07:20](https://youtu.be/7gAwa9i-Vrw?t=4040) to study what the quran says about jews\
[1:07:22](https://youtu.be/7gAwa9i-Vrw?t=4042) if you read from surah al-baqarah to\
[1:07:24](https://youtu.be/7gAwa9i-Vrw?t=4044) surah\
[1:07:26](https://youtu.be/7gAwa9i-Vrw?t=4046) even like there's and surat allah\
[1:07:28](https://youtu.be/7gAwa9i-Vrw?t=4048) mentioned so much\
[1:07:30](https://youtu.be/7gAwa9i-Vrw?t=4050) that the jews right so it's important to\
[1:07:31](https://youtu.be/7gAwa9i-Vrw?t=4051) understand that you know\
[1:07:33](https://youtu.be/7gAwa9i-Vrw?t=4053) allah is not just speaking about the\
[1:07:34](https://youtu.be/7gAwa9i-Vrw?t=4054) medina jews\
[1:07:37](https://youtu.be/7gAwa9i-Vrw?t=4057) this is important to understand because\
[1:07:38](https://youtu.be/7gAwa9i-Vrw?t=4058) the quran is timeless it's not just\
[1:07:41](https://youtu.be/7gAwa9i-Vrw?t=4061) supposed to be about\
[1:07:42](https://youtu.be/7gAwa9i-Vrw?t=4062) the medina jews and so we have to sort\
[1:07:44](https://youtu.be/7gAwa9i-Vrw?t=4064) of\
[1:07:45](https://youtu.be/7gAwa9i-Vrw?t=4065) go back to the quran and look at well\
[1:07:47](https://youtu.be/7gAwa9i-Vrw?t=4067) what's the\
[1:07:48](https://youtu.be/7gAwa9i-Vrw?t=4068) framework that the quran is putting on\
[1:07:50](https://youtu.be/7gAwa9i-Vrw?t=4070) because the quran is very angry with\
[1:07:51](https://youtu.be/7gAwa9i-Vrw?t=4071) jews like allah is\
[1:07:52](https://youtu.be/7gAwa9i-Vrw?t=4072) extremely angry with the yahood in\
[1:07:57](https://youtu.be/7gAwa9i-Vrw?t=4077) i was doing research on this and uh i've\
[1:07:59](https://youtu.be/7gAwa9i-Vrw?t=4079) actually made a lot of videos on this\
[1:08:01](https://youtu.be/7gAwa9i-Vrw?t=4081) where i found out that\
[1:08:02](https://youtu.be/7gAwa9i-Vrw?t=4082) basically everything allah speaks about\
[1:08:05](https://youtu.be/7gAwa9i-Vrw?t=4085) in the quran regards with regards to\
[1:08:07](https://youtu.be/7gAwa9i-Vrw?t=4087) like jews\
[1:08:08](https://youtu.be/7gAwa9i-Vrw?t=4088) and the shirk and this and that that\
[1:08:10](https://youtu.be/7gAwa9i-Vrw?t=4090) they've done this is actually all in\
[1:08:11](https://youtu.be/7gAwa9i-Vrw?t=4091) their literature but no one just knows\
[1:08:12](https://youtu.be/7gAwa9i-Vrw?t=4092) about it\
[1:08:14](https://youtu.be/7gAwa9i-Vrw?t=4094) so i wanted to request that you guys\
[1:08:16](https://youtu.be/7gAwa9i-Vrw?t=4096) look into that\
[1:08:17](https://youtu.be/7gAwa9i-Vrw?t=4097) and just like when you find out like\
[1:08:19](https://youtu.be/7gAwa9i-Vrw?t=4099) they're worse than christians i'm\
[1:08:20](https://youtu.be/7gAwa9i-Vrw?t=4100) telling you right now\
[1:08:21](https://youtu.be/7gAwa9i-Vrw?t=4101) uh the the amount of like allah\
[1:08:24](https://youtu.be/7gAwa9i-Vrw?t=4104) mentioned that they worship their\
[1:08:25](https://youtu.be/7gAwa9i-Vrw?t=4105) scholars\
[1:08:26](https://youtu.be/7gAwa9i-Vrw?t=4106) right that's in sura\
[1:08:32](https://youtu.be/7gAwa9i-Vrw?t=4112) that's actually in their talmud they\
[1:08:34](https://youtu.be/7gAwa9i-Vrw?t=4114) have that they have a narration\
[1:08:36](https://youtu.be/7gAwa9i-Vrw?t=4116) which says that you take rabbis over god\
[1:08:39](https://youtu.be/7gAwa9i-Vrw?t=4119) because you remember\
[1:08:40](https://youtu.be/7gAwa9i-Vrw?t=4120) like you guys know the hadith where the\
[1:08:42](https://youtu.be/7gAwa9i-Vrw?t=4122) prophet explains that the meaning of\
[1:08:43](https://youtu.be/7gAwa9i-Vrw?t=4123) this ayah is like legislation that's in\
[1:08:45](https://youtu.be/7gAwa9i-Vrw?t=4125) the talmud\
[1:08:46](https://youtu.be/7gAwa9i-Vrw?t=4126) then you have the hadith where they\
[1:08:48](https://youtu.be/7gAwa9i-Vrw?t=4128) worship their\
[1:08:50](https://youtu.be/7gAwa9i-Vrw?t=4130) prophets graves that's in the talmud as\
[1:08:52](https://youtu.be/7gAwa9i-Vrw?t=4132) well\
[1:08:53](https://youtu.be/7gAwa9i-Vrw?t=4133) you have stuff like magic that's\
[1:08:55](https://youtu.be/7gAwa9i-Vrw?t=4135) mentioned\
[1:08:59](https://youtu.be/7gAwa9i-Vrw?t=4139) that's in the talmud you have\
[1:09:01](https://youtu.be/7gAwa9i-Vrw?t=4141) superstition allah\
[1:09:02](https://youtu.be/7gAwa9i-Vrw?t=4142) mentioned that as well\
[1:09:10](https://youtu.be/7gAwa9i-Vrw?t=4150) they have uh they actually made\
[1:09:14](https://youtu.be/7gAwa9i-Vrw?t=4154) i made idols on uh this thing called the\
[1:09:16](https://youtu.be/7gAwa9i-Vrw?t=4156) ark of the covenant\
[1:09:17](https://youtu.be/7gAwa9i-Vrw?t=4157) so that's part of their thing it's\
[1:09:20](https://youtu.be/7gAwa9i-Vrw?t=4160) actually very weird so in the\
[1:09:22](https://youtu.be/7gAwa9i-Vrw?t=4162) in in the in the talmud you have this\
[1:09:23](https://youtu.be/7gAwa9i-Vrw?t=4163) narration that\
[1:09:25](https://youtu.be/7gAwa9i-Vrw?t=4165) they have these two idols they're\
[1:09:27](https://youtu.be/7gAwa9i-Vrw?t=4167) essentially well they're graven images\
[1:09:29](https://youtu.be/7gAwa9i-Vrw?t=4169) they don't call them idols but they're\
[1:09:30](https://youtu.be/7gAwa9i-Vrw?t=4170) graven images\
[1:09:31](https://youtu.be/7gAwa9i-Vrw?t=4171) when you talk about the talmud can you\
[1:09:34](https://youtu.be/7gAwa9i-Vrw?t=4174) give us some references from the top yes\
[1:09:35](https://youtu.be/7gAwa9i-Vrw?t=4175) yes so\
[1:09:36](https://youtu.be/7gAwa9i-Vrw?t=4176) uh i can give you the the references for\
[1:09:39](https://youtu.be/7gAwa9i-Vrw?t=4179) sure\
[1:09:40](https://youtu.be/7gAwa9i-Vrw?t=4180) uh if you want me to pull them up right\
[1:09:42](https://youtu.be/7gAwa9i-Vrw?t=4182) now i can't because then\
[1:09:43](https://youtu.be/7gAwa9i-Vrw?t=4183) it's also the emoji yeah because i\
[1:09:45](https://youtu.be/7gAwa9i-Vrw?t=4185) actually have it all\
[1:09:46](https://youtu.be/7gAwa9i-Vrw?t=4186) like i've i posted recently like because\
[1:09:49](https://youtu.be/7gAwa9i-Vrw?t=4189) the initial\
[1:09:50](https://youtu.be/7gAwa9i-Vrw?t=4190) videos i made were like hours and hours\
[1:09:52](https://youtu.be/7gAwa9i-Vrw?t=4192) long but recently i\
[1:09:53](https://youtu.be/7gAwa9i-Vrw?t=4193) i com i compress everything into a 20\
[1:09:56](https://youtu.be/7gAwa9i-Vrw?t=4196) minute like quick video\
[1:09:57](https://youtu.be/7gAwa9i-Vrw?t=4197) i have a document with all the\
[1:09:58](https://youtu.be/7gAwa9i-Vrw?t=4198) references i have a video so i can send\
[1:10:00](https://youtu.be/7gAwa9i-Vrw?t=4200) you that\
[1:10:03](https://youtu.be/7gAwa9i-Vrw?t=4203) islam but it only has 400 subscribers so\
[1:10:05](https://youtu.be/7gAwa9i-Vrw?t=4205) uh it might be harder to look up\
[1:10:07](https://youtu.be/7gAwa9i-Vrw?t=4207) so maybe if you could look up everything\
[1:10:09](https://youtu.be/7gAwa9i-Vrw?t=4209) wrong with judaism in 20 minutes\
[1:10:11](https://youtu.be/7gAwa9i-Vrw?t=4211) proving islam you might you might find\
[1:10:13](https://youtu.be/7gAwa9i-Vrw?t=4213) it but\
[1:10:14](https://youtu.be/7gAwa9i-Vrw?t=4214) like the reason i i like for me this was\
[1:10:17](https://youtu.be/7gAwa9i-Vrw?t=4217) a big thing because when i was\
[1:10:18](https://youtu.be/7gAwa9i-Vrw?t=4218) younger i was thinking about you know\
[1:10:20](https://youtu.be/7gAwa9i-Vrw?t=4220) like everyone plays this cancellation\
[1:10:22](https://youtu.be/7gAwa9i-Vrw?t=4222) game like\
[1:10:23](https://youtu.be/7gAwa9i-Vrw?t=4223) okay this this religion can't be true\
[1:10:25](https://youtu.be/7gAwa9i-Vrw?t=4225) because it's trinity and that's stupid\
[1:10:26](https://youtu.be/7gAwa9i-Vrw?t=4226) and this religion can't be true because\
[1:10:28](https://youtu.be/7gAwa9i-Vrw?t=4228) it's idols and that's\
[1:10:29](https://youtu.be/7gAwa9i-Vrw?t=4229) doesn't make any sense so for me it was\
[1:10:31](https://youtu.be/7gAwa9i-Vrw?t=4231) always like well what about judaism\
[1:10:34](https://youtu.be/7gAwa9i-Vrw?t=4234) because they seem to have the same\
[1:10:35](https://youtu.be/7gAwa9i-Vrw?t=4235) concept of allah but they actually don't\
[1:10:37](https://youtu.be/7gAwa9i-Vrw?t=4237) and i think it's just important that\
[1:10:39](https://youtu.be/7gAwa9i-Vrw?t=4239) people find\
[1:10:40](https://youtu.be/7gAwa9i-Vrw?t=4240) that out for themselves so i think that\
[1:10:42](https://youtu.be/7gAwa9i-Vrw?t=4242) you've made a few\
[1:10:43](https://youtu.be/7gAwa9i-Vrw?t=4243) like a host of really good points\
[1:10:45](https://youtu.be/7gAwa9i-Vrw?t=4245) there's one thing i would\
[1:10:46](https://youtu.be/7gAwa9i-Vrw?t=4246) be careful of saying especially in\
[1:10:48](https://youtu.be/7gAwa9i-Vrw?t=4248) public is that allah is very angry with\
[1:10:49](https://youtu.be/7gAwa9i-Vrw?t=4249) the jews\
[1:10:51](https://youtu.be/7gAwa9i-Vrw?t=4251) okay yeah well what i meant was in in\
[1:10:53](https://youtu.be/7gAwa9i-Vrw?t=4253) yeah i understand what you're saying but\
[1:10:55](https://youtu.be/7gAwa9i-Vrw?t=4255) like if you read the quran\
[1:10:56](https://youtu.be/7gAwa9i-Vrw?t=4256) allah describes them as a people who are\
[1:10:58](https://youtu.be/7gAwa9i-Vrw?t=4258) who he's angry but\
[1:10:59](https://youtu.be/7gAwa9i-Vrw?t=4259) angry with but the reason he's angry\
[1:11:01](https://youtu.be/7gAwa9i-Vrw?t=4261) with and it's important it's good that\
[1:11:03](https://youtu.be/7gAwa9i-Vrw?t=4263) you brought that up because now i get to\
[1:11:04](https://youtu.be/7gAwa9i-Vrw?t=4264) clarify\
[1:11:05](https://youtu.be/7gAwa9i-Vrw?t=4265) the reason that the yahood are\
[1:11:07](https://youtu.be/7gAwa9i-Vrw?t=4267) classified as the people allah is angry\
[1:11:09](https://youtu.be/7gAwa9i-Vrw?t=4269) with\
[1:11:10](https://youtu.be/7gAwa9i-Vrw?t=4270) is because they knew the description of\
[1:11:13](https://youtu.be/7gAwa9i-Vrw?t=4273) muhammad sallallahu alaihi wasallam in\
[1:11:14](https://youtu.be/7gAwa9i-Vrw?t=4274) the torah\
[1:11:15](https://youtu.be/7gAwa9i-Vrw?t=4275) and they turned away anyway so it's not\
[1:11:17](https://youtu.be/7gAwa9i-Vrw?t=4277) that oh they're jews so allah hates them\
[1:11:20](https://youtu.be/7gAwa9i-Vrw?t=4280) no rather allah chose them they they\
[1:11:21](https://youtu.be/7gAwa9i-Vrw?t=4281) were chosen people\
[1:11:23](https://youtu.be/7gAwa9i-Vrw?t=4283) and they knew that the prophet is coming\
[1:11:25](https://youtu.be/7gAwa9i-Vrw?t=4285) but yet they turned away so that's a\
[1:11:26](https://youtu.be/7gAwa9i-Vrw?t=4286) good point i'm glad you made that we've\
[1:11:28](https://youtu.be/7gAwa9i-Vrw?t=4288) got to be careful that\
[1:11:29](https://youtu.be/7gAwa9i-Vrw?t=4289) uh are the jews of today the same like\
[1:11:32](https://youtu.be/7gAwa9i-Vrw?t=4292) are they actually jews in the sense that\
[1:11:34](https://youtu.be/7gAwa9i-Vrw?t=4294) like from the definitions that we have\
[1:11:36](https://youtu.be/7gAwa9i-Vrw?t=4296) or are they european\
[1:11:38](https://youtu.be/7gAwa9i-Vrw?t=4298) uh i mean to what extent well well okay\
[1:11:40](https://youtu.be/7gAwa9i-Vrw?t=4300) but see the thing there\
[1:11:42](https://youtu.be/7gAwa9i-Vrw?t=4302) is\
[1:11:45](https://youtu.be/7gAwa9i-Vrw?t=4305) the religion and bani israel means the\
[1:11:47](https://youtu.be/7gAwa9i-Vrw?t=4307) race so\
[1:11:48](https://youtu.be/7gAwa9i-Vrw?t=4308) i don't think that distinction applies\
[1:11:50](https://youtu.be/7gAwa9i-Vrw?t=4310) to the quran because yahood is the\
[1:11:51](https://youtu.be/7gAwa9i-Vrw?t=4311) religion so even if you say that the\
[1:11:53](https://youtu.be/7gAwa9i-Vrw?t=4313) today's jews are\
[1:11:54](https://youtu.be/7gAwa9i-Vrw?t=4314) europeans\
[1:11:59](https://youtu.be/7gAwa9i-Vrw?t=4319) is that right though what what\
[1:12:02](https://youtu.be/7gAwa9i-Vrw?t=4322) when israel is definitely talking about\
[1:12:05](https://youtu.be/7gAwa9i-Vrw?t=4325) race for sure yeah\
[1:12:06](https://youtu.be/7gAwa9i-Vrw?t=4326) because even even even uh the earliest\
[1:12:08](https://youtu.be/7gAwa9i-Vrw?t=4328) followers of isla islam are called bani\
[1:12:11](https://youtu.be/7gAwa9i-Vrw?t=4331) israel in the quran\
[1:12:12](https://youtu.be/7gAwa9i-Vrw?t=4332) in surah 61 ayah 14.\
[1:12:16](https://youtu.be/7gAwa9i-Vrw?t=4336) no but it's not just this it's like a\
[1:12:18](https://youtu.be/7gAwa9i-Vrw?t=4338) latina\
[1:12:20](https://youtu.be/7gAwa9i-Vrw?t=4340) so that they have they've become\
[1:12:22](https://youtu.be/7gAwa9i-Vrw?t=4342) something it's like they are yeah so\
[1:12:23](https://youtu.be/7gAwa9i-Vrw?t=4343) that's their religion\
[1:12:24](https://youtu.be/7gAwa9i-Vrw?t=4344) yes makes sense okay look\
[1:12:28](https://youtu.be/7gAwa9i-Vrw?t=4348) what i'm saying to you now is uh you've\
[1:12:30](https://youtu.be/7gAwa9i-Vrw?t=4350) made a host of good points we'd like to\
[1:12:31](https://youtu.be/7gAwa9i-Vrw?t=4351) have\
[1:12:32](https://youtu.be/7gAwa9i-Vrw?t=4352) your references yeah i mean one more\
[1:12:33](https://youtu.be/7gAwa9i-Vrw?t=4353) thing that i would add to what you've\
[1:12:35](https://youtu.be/7gAwa9i-Vrw?t=4355) said is that the\
[1:12:36](https://youtu.be/7gAwa9i-Vrw?t=4356) quran says\
[1:12:39](https://youtu.be/7gAwa9i-Vrw?t=4359) yes we haven't seen you before i have an\
[1:12:42](https://youtu.be/7gAwa9i-Vrw?t=4362) answer for that as well\
[1:12:43](https://youtu.be/7gAwa9i-Vrw?t=4363) yeah because i know the jews say that a\
[1:12:45](https://youtu.be/7gAwa9i-Vrw?t=4365) prophet cannot abrogate the law\
[1:12:47](https://youtu.be/7gAwa9i-Vrw?t=4367) so this is one point i actually wanted\
[1:12:49](https://youtu.be/7gAwa9i-Vrw?t=4369) to make to brother muhammad hijab that\
[1:12:51](https://youtu.be/7gAwa9i-Vrw?t=4371) he brought up that\
[1:12:52](https://youtu.be/7gAwa9i-Vrw?t=4372) i uh that it's important to understand\
[1:12:54](https://youtu.be/7gAwa9i-Vrw?t=4374) that the prophet sallallahu alaihi\
[1:12:57](https://youtu.be/7gAwa9i-Vrw?t=4377) wasallam is in there by it is in their\
[1:12:59](https://youtu.be/7gAwa9i-Vrw?t=4379) books like\
[1:13:00](https://youtu.be/7gAwa9i-Vrw?t=4380) i i can tell you that for a fact right\
[1:13:01](https://youtu.be/7gAwa9i-Vrw?t=4381) now because i know like i've seen videos\
[1:13:03](https://youtu.be/7gAwa9i-Vrw?t=4383) where mohammed hijab\
[1:13:05](https://youtu.be/7gAwa9i-Vrw?t=4385) uh brother is saying like he doesn't\
[1:13:07](https://youtu.be/7gAwa9i-Vrw?t=4387) think deuteronomy 18\
[1:13:09](https://youtu.be/7gAwa9i-Vrw?t=4389) and the paraclete sings are that clear\
[1:13:11](https://youtu.be/7gAwa9i-Vrw?t=4391) but that he thinks isaiah 42 is clear\
[1:13:14](https://youtu.be/7gAwa9i-Vrw?t=4394) and this and that\
[1:13:15](https://youtu.be/7gAwa9i-Vrw?t=4395) well i'll i'll tell you right now like\
[1:13:17](https://youtu.be/7gAwa9i-Vrw?t=4397) they can't answer\
[1:13:18](https://youtu.be/7gAwa9i-Vrw?t=4398) the uh these prophecies like i like you\
[1:13:20](https://youtu.be/7gAwa9i-Vrw?t=4400) can ask me i have experience in this\
[1:13:22](https://youtu.be/7gAwa9i-Vrw?t=4402) field with\
[1:13:23](https://youtu.be/7gAwa9i-Vrw?t=4403) like i know you're more inclined to like\
[1:13:25](https://youtu.be/7gAwa9i-Vrw?t=4405) the philosophical kind of stuff you guys\
[1:13:26](https://youtu.be/7gAwa9i-Vrw?t=4406) you're more into that by someone who's\
[1:13:28](https://youtu.be/7gAwa9i-Vrw?t=4408) more\
[1:13:28](https://youtu.be/7gAwa9i-Vrw?t=4408) uh like uh exposed to the kitab side of\
[1:13:31](https://youtu.be/7gAwa9i-Vrw?t=4411) things\
[1:13:32](https://youtu.be/7gAwa9i-Vrw?t=4412) i can tell you that that for sure the\
[1:13:34](https://youtu.be/7gAwa9i-Vrw?t=4414) those prophecies are\
[1:13:36](https://youtu.be/7gAwa9i-Vrw?t=4416) uh yeah yeah so you can find that\
[1:13:39](https://youtu.be/7gAwa9i-Vrw?t=4419) document in the description\
[1:13:41](https://youtu.be/7gAwa9i-Vrw?t=4421) too it's in the description but what i\
[1:13:43](https://youtu.be/7gAwa9i-Vrw?t=4423) wanted to say to brother muhammad\
[1:13:45](https://youtu.be/7gAwa9i-Vrw?t=4425) i know you're into that stuff but as\
[1:13:47](https://youtu.be/7gAwa9i-Vrw?t=4427) someone who's more exposed to that\
[1:13:49](https://youtu.be/7gAwa9i-Vrw?t=4429) i can tell you that he is there for sure\
[1:13:51](https://youtu.be/7gAwa9i-Vrw?t=4431) and it's very very clear\
[1:13:52](https://youtu.be/7gAwa9i-Vrw?t=4432) the problem is you have to check back\
[1:13:55](https://youtu.be/7gAwa9i-Vrw?t=4435) the hebrew a lot of times because they\
[1:13:58](https://youtu.be/7gAwa9i-Vrw?t=4438) they they hide stuff in translations\
[1:14:01](https://youtu.be/7gAwa9i-Vrw?t=4441) intentionally or unintentionally if i\
[1:14:03](https://youtu.be/7gAwa9i-Vrw?t=4443) just just speak\
[1:14:04](https://youtu.be/7gAwa9i-Vrw?t=4444) look i mean it's not bad no i i no i\
[1:14:06](https://youtu.be/7gAwa9i-Vrw?t=4446) mean uh what i'm trying to say is\
[1:14:08](https://youtu.be/7gAwa9i-Vrw?t=4448) unintentionally or intentionally the\
[1:14:10](https://youtu.be/7gAwa9i-Vrw?t=4450) translations uh\
[1:14:12](https://youtu.be/7gAwa9i-Vrw?t=4452) are problematic but if you actually\
[1:14:14](https://youtu.be/7gAwa9i-Vrw?t=4454) check back the hebrew and also a lot of\
[1:14:16](https://youtu.be/7gAwa9i-Vrw?t=4456) times their explanations\
[1:14:18](https://youtu.be/7gAwa9i-Vrw?t=4458) are really bad but people just buy them\
[1:14:19](https://youtu.be/7gAwa9i-Vrw?t=4459) because people don't understand the\
[1:14:21](https://youtu.be/7gAwa9i-Vrw?t=4461) bible so i know like i'm sure you guys\
[1:14:23](https://youtu.be/7gAwa9i-Vrw?t=4463) i have heard of brother zucker her say i\
[1:14:26](https://youtu.be/7gAwa9i-Vrw?t=4466) would say if you really want to know the\
[1:14:27](https://youtu.be/7gAwa9i-Vrw?t=4467) stuff you can contact him because he's\
[1:14:29](https://youtu.be/7gAwa9i-Vrw?t=4469) done\
[1:14:30](https://youtu.be/7gAwa9i-Vrw?t=4470) 10 years of research on this and i can\
[1:14:32](https://youtu.be/7gAwa9i-Vrw?t=4472) tell you for a fact like those are\
[1:14:34](https://youtu.be/7gAwa9i-Vrw?t=4474) legitimate\
[1:14:35](https://youtu.be/7gAwa9i-Vrw?t=4475) prophecies even we have clear clear\
[1:14:37](https://youtu.be/7gAwa9i-Vrw?t=4477) evidence that they were waiting for\
[1:14:39](https://youtu.be/7gAwa9i-Vrw?t=4479) the prophet muhammad because you know\
[1:14:41](https://youtu.be/7gAwa9i-Vrw?t=4481) they'll say that oh you only get that\
[1:14:42](https://youtu.be/7gAwa9i-Vrw?t=4482) from the hadith and you muslims must\
[1:14:44](https://youtu.be/7gAwa9i-Vrw?t=4484) have made it up right\
[1:14:45](https://youtu.be/7gAwa9i-Vrw?t=4485) but in dead sea scrolls they're waiting\
[1:14:47](https://youtu.be/7gAwa9i-Vrw?t=4487) for the prophet they actually call him\
[1:14:49](https://youtu.be/7gAwa9i-Vrw?t=4489) the prophet and the reference is\
[1:14:50](https://youtu.be/7gAwa9i-Vrw?t=4490) deuteronomy 18.\
[1:14:52](https://youtu.be/7gAwa9i-Vrw?t=4492) the new testament they're waiting for\
[1:14:54](https://youtu.be/7gAwa9i-Vrw?t=4494) him it's the same thing\
[1:14:56](https://youtu.be/7gAwa9i-Vrw?t=4496) in john 1 21. so you can see the jews of\
[1:14:58](https://youtu.be/7gAwa9i-Vrw?t=4498) the first century\
[1:14:59](https://youtu.be/7gAwa9i-Vrw?t=4499) in the dead sea scrolls were waiting for\
[1:15:00](https://youtu.be/7gAwa9i-Vrw?t=4500) a prophet this was the end time prophet\
[1:15:02](https://youtu.be/7gAwa9i-Vrw?t=4502) to come\
[1:15:03](https://youtu.be/7gAwa9i-Vrw?t=4503) in in the new testament you have\
[1:15:05](https://youtu.be/7gAwa9i-Vrw?t=4505) evidence that they were waiting for this\
[1:15:06](https://youtu.be/7gAwa9i-Vrw?t=4506) prophet as well because it's the jews\
[1:15:08](https://youtu.be/7gAwa9i-Vrw?t=4508) speaking\
[1:15:08](https://youtu.be/7gAwa9i-Vrw?t=4508) so even though they don't accept the new\
[1:15:10](https://youtu.be/7gAwa9i-Vrw?t=4510) testament historically it's true\
[1:15:12](https://youtu.be/7gAwa9i-Vrw?t=4512) and then finally in philo's writings do\
[1:15:14](https://youtu.be/7gAwa9i-Vrw?t=4514) you guys know who philo is\
[1:15:17](https://youtu.be/7gAwa9i-Vrw?t=4517) alexandra yeah yeah so uh he also\
[1:15:19](https://youtu.be/7gAwa9i-Vrw?t=4519) expects the deuteronomy 18 prophet to\
[1:15:21](https://youtu.be/7gAwa9i-Vrw?t=4521) come\
[1:15:22](https://youtu.be/7gAwa9i-Vrw?t=4522) or it's hinted towards that it's the\
[1:15:23](https://youtu.be/7gAwa9i-Vrw?t=4523) deuteronomy 18 profit\
[1:15:25](https://youtu.be/7gAwa9i-Vrw?t=4525) and then finally you have the medina\
[1:15:27](https://youtu.be/7gAwa9i-Vrw?t=4527) juice so that's four independent sources\
[1:15:29](https://youtu.be/7gAwa9i-Vrw?t=4529) which confirmed they were all waiting\
[1:15:31](https://youtu.be/7gAwa9i-Vrw?t=4531) for a profit so\
[1:15:33](https://youtu.be/7gAwa9i-Vrw?t=4533) you've got like the medina jews like um\
[1:15:36](https://youtu.be/7gAwa9i-Vrw?t=4536) for instance you know that\
[1:15:38](https://youtu.be/7gAwa9i-Vrw?t=4538) i'm not sure obviously he's been to haye\
[1:15:41](https://youtu.be/7gAwa9i-Vrw?t=4541) and she was the prophet\
[1:15:44](https://youtu.be/7gAwa9i-Vrw?t=4544) she was one of the dwight of the prophet\
[1:15:45](https://youtu.be/7gAwa9i-Vrw?t=4545) and he basically\
[1:15:47](https://youtu.be/7gAwa9i-Vrw?t=4547) um obviously he was killed in the\
[1:15:51](https://youtu.be/7gAwa9i-Vrw?t=4551) kaiba yeah\
[1:15:54](https://youtu.be/7gAwa9i-Vrw?t=4554) and people don't realize that and we\
[1:15:56](https://youtu.be/7gAwa9i-Vrw?t=4556) will make a video about this actually\
[1:15:58](https://youtu.be/7gAwa9i-Vrw?t=4558) quite\
[1:15:58](https://youtu.be/7gAwa9i-Vrw?t=4558) soon inshallah about how this whole\
[1:16:01](https://youtu.be/7gAwa9i-Vrw?t=4561) thing took place because\
[1:16:02](https://youtu.be/7gAwa9i-Vrw?t=4562) it's you've got to think about sophia\
[1:16:04](https://youtu.be/7gAwa9i-Vrw?t=4564) she\
[1:16:05](https://youtu.be/7gAwa9i-Vrw?t=4565) married the man\
[1:16:08](https://youtu.be/7gAwa9i-Vrw?t=4568) whose army killed her father and you\
[1:16:10](https://youtu.be/7gAwa9i-Vrw?t=4570) know parts of her family so\
[1:16:12](https://youtu.be/7gAwa9i-Vrw?t=4572) it was not an easy it wasn't just like\
[1:16:14](https://youtu.be/7gAwa9i-Vrw?t=4574) you know he just took her hand and\
[1:16:16](https://youtu.be/7gAwa9i-Vrw?t=4576) just said that's how it goes there was a\
[1:16:18](https://youtu.be/7gAwa9i-Vrw?t=4578) lot of\
[1:16:19](https://youtu.be/7gAwa9i-Vrw?t=4579) discussion between sophia and muhammad\
[1:16:22](https://youtu.be/7gAwa9i-Vrw?t=4582) allah\
[1:16:23](https://youtu.be/7gAwa9i-Vrw?t=4583) and in that discussion you see you get\
[1:16:25](https://youtu.be/7gAwa9i-Vrw?t=4585) an in\
[1:16:26](https://youtu.be/7gAwa9i-Vrw?t=4586) um house kind of a picture of what was\
[1:16:29](https://youtu.be/7gAwa9i-Vrw?t=4589) what these particular benu\
[1:16:31](https://youtu.be/7gAwa9i-Vrw?t=4591) uh nadir jews or the particular tribe\
[1:16:35](https://youtu.be/7gAwa9i-Vrw?t=4595) what they were doing what they were\
[1:16:37](https://youtu.be/7gAwa9i-Vrw?t=4597) saying and\
[1:16:39](https://youtu.be/7gAwa9i-Vrw?t=4599) what basically uh she said and this is\
[1:16:41](https://youtu.be/7gAwa9i-Vrw?t=4601) one of the most\
[1:16:42](https://youtu.be/7gAwa9i-Vrw?t=4602) powerful narrations in the islamic\
[1:16:44](https://youtu.be/7gAwa9i-Vrw?t=4604) tradition\
[1:16:45](https://youtu.be/7gAwa9i-Vrw?t=4605) uh that i came across on this matter\
[1:16:49](https://youtu.be/7gAwa9i-Vrw?t=4609) is that she said that obviously she had\
[1:16:51](https://youtu.be/7gAwa9i-Vrw?t=4611) her dream and that's\
[1:16:53](https://youtu.be/7gAwa9i-Vrw?t=4613) you guys can check that out her dream\
[1:16:55](https://youtu.be/7gAwa9i-Vrw?t=4615) like you know that she saw this and the\
[1:16:56](https://youtu.be/7gAwa9i-Vrw?t=4616) moon and all that stuff\
[1:16:58](https://youtu.be/7gAwa9i-Vrw?t=4618) check that away out if you don't know\
[1:16:59](https://youtu.be/7gAwa9i-Vrw?t=4619) what i'm talking about but something\
[1:17:00](https://youtu.be/7gAwa9i-Vrw?t=4620) really powerful is that she one time\
[1:17:02](https://youtu.be/7gAwa9i-Vrw?t=4622) overheard her dad\
[1:17:03](https://youtu.be/7gAwa9i-Vrw?t=4623) yeah yeah and her uncle having a\
[1:17:06](https://youtu.be/7gAwa9i-Vrw?t=4626) discussion\
[1:17:07](https://youtu.be/7gAwa9i-Vrw?t=4627) right and they were discussing with each\
[1:17:10](https://youtu.be/7gAwa9i-Vrw?t=4630) other\
[1:17:10](https://youtu.be/7gAwa9i-Vrw?t=4630) and they were saying something to the\
[1:17:11](https://youtu.be/7gAwa9i-Vrw?t=4631) effects of do you think he is the\
[1:17:14](https://youtu.be/7gAwa9i-Vrw?t=4634) pro like you were saying right yeah yeah\
[1:17:16](https://youtu.be/7gAwa9i-Vrw?t=4636) that's interesting because\
[1:17:17](https://youtu.be/7gAwa9i-Vrw?t=4637) everyone refers to this prophet as the\
[1:17:20](https://youtu.be/7gAwa9i-Vrw?t=4640) prophet\
[1:17:26](https://youtu.be/7gAwa9i-Vrw?t=4646) so after he's you know what do you think\
[1:17:29](https://youtu.be/7gAwa9i-Vrw?t=4649) of him in and\
[1:17:30](https://youtu.be/7gAwa9i-Vrw?t=4650) the father said i know for a fact that\
[1:17:33](https://youtu.be/7gAwa9i-Vrw?t=4653) this is him\
[1:17:34](https://youtu.be/7gAwa9i-Vrw?t=4654) okay obviously\
[1:17:38](https://youtu.be/7gAwa9i-Vrw?t=4658) yeah so here's this\
[1:17:41](https://youtu.be/7gAwa9i-Vrw?t=4661) and sorry this this particular uh had it\
[1:17:44](https://youtu.be/7gAwa9i-Vrw?t=4664) for this particular incident\
[1:17:46](https://youtu.be/7gAwa9i-Vrw?t=4666) she said he said yeah so what are you\
[1:17:48](https://youtu.be/7gAwa9i-Vrw?t=4668) going to do with him so now the uncle's\
[1:17:50](https://youtu.be/7gAwa9i-Vrw?t=4670) questioning the father he says what are\
[1:17:52](https://youtu.be/7gAwa9i-Vrw?t=4672) you going to do with it he says i'm\
[1:17:53](https://youtu.be/7gAwa9i-Vrw?t=4673) going to impose him as long as i live\
[1:17:55](https://youtu.be/7gAwa9i-Vrw?t=4675) and this and this was one of the main\
[1:17:57](https://youtu.be/7gAwa9i-Vrw?t=4677) reasons by the way that made sophia\
[1:18:00](https://youtu.be/7gAwa9i-Vrw?t=4680) she inclined to the prophet muhammad\
[1:18:02](https://youtu.be/7gAwa9i-Vrw?t=4682) because she knew that he was a true\
[1:18:04](https://youtu.be/7gAwa9i-Vrw?t=4684) prophet\
[1:18:05](https://youtu.be/7gAwa9i-Vrw?t=4685) and that she saw that she witnessed that\
[1:18:07](https://youtu.be/7gAwa9i-Vrw?t=4687) conversation because the medina\
[1:18:09](https://youtu.be/7gAwa9i-Vrw?t=4689) why would think about the quran like it\
[1:18:11](https://youtu.be/7gAwa9i-Vrw?t=4691) would make no sense for the quran to\
[1:18:13](https://youtu.be/7gAwa9i-Vrw?t=4693) make the claim\
[1:18:14](https://youtu.be/7gAwa9i-Vrw?t=4694) uh you know they they know him like they\
[1:18:16](https://youtu.be/7gAwa9i-Vrw?t=4696) know that you're yani like they are\
[1:18:18](https://youtu.be/7gAwa9i-Vrw?t=4698) like their children yeah why would\
[1:18:19](https://youtu.be/7gAwa9i-Vrw?t=4699) people say that and\
[1:18:21](https://youtu.be/7gAwa9i-Vrw?t=4701) why would it say things like you know\
[1:18:23](https://youtu.be/7gAwa9i-Vrw?t=4703) they know it this kind of thing\
[1:18:25](https://youtu.be/7gAwa9i-Vrw?t=4705) brother hijab you don't understand like\
[1:18:28](https://youtu.be/7gAwa9i-Vrw?t=4708) once\
[1:18:28](https://youtu.be/7gAwa9i-Vrw?t=4708) you interact with jews like because\
[1:18:31](https://youtu.be/7gAwa9i-Vrw?t=4711) dawah to jews is\
[1:18:32](https://youtu.be/7gAwa9i-Vrw?t=4712) almost no one does it right but ivan's\
[1:18:35](https://youtu.be/7gAwa9i-Vrw?t=4715) like reading suratul baqarah\
[1:18:37](https://youtu.be/7gAwa9i-Vrw?t=4717) and like mothering quran like for so\
[1:18:40](https://youtu.be/7gAwa9i-Vrw?t=4720) long\
[1:18:41](https://youtu.be/7gAwa9i-Vrw?t=4721) and when i started actually doing tawa\
[1:18:43](https://youtu.be/7gAwa9i-Vrw?t=4723) to jews like\
[1:18:44](https://youtu.be/7gAwa9i-Vrw?t=4724) you'll be shocked at the way they react\
[1:18:47](https://youtu.be/7gAwa9i-Vrw?t=4727) is exactly like the quran affirms it\
[1:18:50](https://youtu.be/7gAwa9i-Vrw?t=4730) like\
[1:18:51](https://youtu.be/7gAwa9i-Vrw?t=4731) exactly what the quran says they'll\
[1:18:52](https://youtu.be/7gAwa9i-Vrw?t=4732) don't exactly what they do\
[1:18:54](https://youtu.be/7gAwa9i-Vrw?t=4734) don't generalize because yeah i know but\
[1:18:57](https://youtu.be/7gAwa9i-Vrw?t=4737) you're like you can see those attitudes\
[1:18:58](https://youtu.be/7gAwa9i-Vrw?t=4738) like i had a jew\
[1:18:59](https://youtu.be/7gAwa9i-Vrw?t=4739) i had a jew tell me no because he's an\
[1:19:01](https://youtu.be/7gAwa9i-Vrw?t=4741) arab i understand this i get it\
[1:19:04](https://youtu.be/7gAwa9i-Vrw?t=4744) and by the way they've got us in the old\
[1:19:06](https://youtu.be/7gAwa9i-Vrw?t=4746) testament you know god repents it to the\
[1:19:08](https://youtu.be/7gAwa9i-Vrw?t=4748) jews you know in genesis rabbi 27 4\
[1:19:12](https://youtu.be/7gAwa9i-Vrw?t=4752) it mentions how god was about that\
[1:19:14](https://youtu.be/7gAwa9i-Vrw?t=4754) repent idea he's like\

[1:19:49](https://youtu.be/7gAwa9i-Vrw?t=4789) right so it's probably what you said is\
[1:19:52](https://youtu.be/7gAwa9i-Vrw?t=4792) right\
[1:19:52](https://youtu.be/7gAwa9i-Vrw?t=4792) so this is according to news now joseph\

[1:19:59](https://youtu.be/7gAwa9i-Vrw?t=4799) because you said you're a specialist in\
[1:20:00](https://youtu.be/7gAwa9i-Vrw?t=4800) judaism and he's like the number one\
[1:20:02](https://youtu.be/7gAwa9i-Vrw?t=4802) most published man uh\
[1:20:04](https://youtu.be/7gAwa9i-Vrw?t=4804) for judaism and talks about these\
[1:20:05](https://youtu.be/7gAwa9i-Vrw?t=4805) matters right so\
[1:20:07](https://youtu.be/7gAwa9i-Vrw?t=4807) so once again bro you know if you're\
[1:20:09](https://youtu.be/7gAwa9i-Vrw?t=4809) going to claim to be especially\
[1:20:11](https://youtu.be/7gAwa9i-Vrw?t=4811) something you should know the names of\
[1:20:12](https://youtu.be/7gAwa9i-Vrw?t=4812) the people who are the olympia of that\
[1:20:14](https://youtu.be/7gAwa9i-Vrw?t=4814) thing so\
[1:20:15](https://youtu.be/7gAwa9i-Vrw?t=4815) news now is actually he's on the\
[1:20:17](https://youtu.be/7gAwa9i-Vrw?t=4817) guinness guinness world book of records\
[1:20:19](https://youtu.be/7gAwa9i-Vrw?t=4819) or something for\
[1:20:20](https://youtu.be/7gAwa9i-Vrw?t=4820) producing the most books ever written\
[1:20:23](https://youtu.be/7gAwa9i-Vrw?t=4823) okay\
[1:20:23](https://youtu.be/7gAwa9i-Vrw?t=4823) uh in the present age i think he's\
[1:20:25](https://youtu.be/7gAwa9i-Vrw?t=4825) actually produced 900 books\
[1:20:27](https://youtu.be/7gAwa9i-Vrw?t=4827) his he's he's uh he produced 900 uh\
[1:20:31](https://youtu.be/7gAwa9i-Vrw?t=4831) news now his name is newsnah right in\
[1:20:33](https://youtu.be/7gAwa9i-Vrw?t=4833) the present age according to\
[1:20:35](https://youtu.be/7gAwa9i-Vrw?t=4835) in the present age yeah oh right i know\
[1:20:37](https://youtu.be/7gAwa9i-Vrw?t=4837) but i i\
[1:20:38](https://youtu.be/7gAwa9i-Vrw?t=4838) tend to stick to the classical jewish\
[1:20:40](https://youtu.be/7gAwa9i-Vrw?t=4840) scholars\
[1:20:41](https://youtu.be/7gAwa9i-Vrw?t=4841) yeah of course but of the present ages\
[1:20:45](https://youtu.be/7gAwa9i-Vrw?t=4845) the second resource material and he he\
[1:20:48](https://youtu.be/7gAwa9i-Vrw?t=4848) says that eugenice's rubber is actually\
[1:20:51](https://youtu.be/7gAwa9i-Vrw?t=4851) dated between 400 to 500\
[1:20:54](https://youtu.be/7gAwa9i-Vrw?t=4854) a.d which is interesting because what\
[1:20:56](https://youtu.be/7gAwa9i-Vrw?t=4856) four to 500\
[1:20:57](https://youtu.be/7gAwa9i-Vrw?t=4857) a.d is um\
[1:21:00](https://youtu.be/7gAwa9i-Vrw?t=4860) after the futuristic period for the most\
[1:21:02](https://youtu.be/7gAwa9i-Vrw?t=4862) part like most ecumenical writers would\
[1:21:04](https://youtu.be/7gAwa9i-Vrw?t=4864) have written what they had to write\
[1:21:05](https://youtu.be/7gAwa9i-Vrw?t=4865) so which means genesis rabbi which is\
[1:21:07](https://youtu.be/7gAwa9i-Vrw?t=4867) part of mid-russian right\
[1:21:09](https://youtu.be/7gAwa9i-Vrw?t=4869) yeah all right is it post dates\
[1:21:13](https://youtu.be/7gAwa9i-Vrw?t=4873) so in post states genesis rabbi\
[1:21:17](https://youtu.be/7gAwa9i-Vrw?t=4877) it post states the patriotistic works\
[1:21:19](https://youtu.be/7gAwa9i-Vrw?t=4879) and so\
[1:21:20](https://youtu.be/7gAwa9i-Vrw?t=4880) but this this is important in and of\
[1:21:22](https://youtu.be/7gAwa9i-Vrw?t=4882) itself i think\
[1:21:23](https://youtu.be/7gAwa9i-Vrw?t=4883) i think i actually read\
[1:21:27](https://youtu.be/7gAwa9i-Vrw?t=4887) certain jewish tafseers on this\
[1:21:30](https://youtu.be/7gAwa9i-Vrw?t=4890) where they i'm going to slow down\
[1:21:32](https://youtu.be/7gAwa9i-Vrw?t=4892) because you advised me so i think i\
[1:21:34](https://youtu.be/7gAwa9i-Vrw?t=4894) actually\
[1:21:35](https://youtu.be/7gAwa9i-Vrw?t=4895) read sir some uh tafsirs of of uh\
[1:21:39](https://youtu.be/7gAwa9i-Vrw?t=4899) the genesis where it talks about god\
[1:21:41](https://youtu.be/7gAwa9i-Vrw?t=4901) regretting and they were\
[1:21:42](https://youtu.be/7gAwa9i-Vrw?t=4902) quoting genesis rabah this idea\
[1:21:46](https://youtu.be/7gAwa9i-Vrw?t=4906) i like found it in every tafseer i was\
[1:21:48](https://youtu.be/7gAwa9i-Vrw?t=4908) going through rashi\
[1:21:50](https://youtu.be/7gAwa9i-Vrw?t=4910) ibn ezra all of them they were all\
[1:21:52](https://youtu.be/7gAwa9i-Vrw?t=4912) quoting this idea from genesis rabad\
[1:21:54](https://youtu.be/7gAwa9i-Vrw?t=4914) that\
[1:21:54](https://youtu.be/7gAwa9i-Vrw?t=4914) the basically the story is god is like\
[1:21:56](https://youtu.be/7gAwa9i-Vrw?t=4916) it was my mistake that i\
[1:21:58](https://youtu.be/7gAwa9i-Vrw?t=4918) uh created human beings i should have\
[1:22:01](https://youtu.be/7gAwa9i-Vrw?t=4921) made them angels and this and that\
[1:22:04](https://youtu.be/7gAwa9i-Vrw?t=4924) so uh we think the tradition\
[1:22:08](https://youtu.be/7gAwa9i-Vrw?t=4928) might go back because you know even the\
[1:22:10](https://youtu.be/7gAwa9i-Vrw?t=4930) talmud is influenced by islam some of it\
[1:22:12](https://youtu.be/7gAwa9i-Vrw?t=4932) so i think the traditions are going back\
[1:22:15](https://youtu.be/7gAwa9i-Vrw?t=4935) even though it might have been written\
[1:22:16](https://youtu.be/7gAwa9i-Vrw?t=4936) later\
[1:22:17](https://youtu.be/7gAwa9i-Vrw?t=4937) okay well thanks so much for your\

[1:23:10](https://youtu.be/7gAwa9i-Vrw?t=4990) careful of it because now\
[1:23:12](https://youtu.be/7gAwa9i-Vrw?t=4992) uh to be to be actually established in a\
[1:23:14](https://youtu.be/7gAwa9i-Vrw?t=4994) field like and bro\

[1:23:32](https://youtu.be/7gAwa9i-Vrw?t=5012) all this what i mean here is this what i\
[1:23:34](https://youtu.be/7gAwa9i-Vrw?t=5014) mean is that\

[1:32:42](https://youtu.be/7gAwa9i-Vrw?t=5562) look it up it's uh like uh\
[1:32:44](https://youtu.be/7gAwa9i-Vrw?t=5564) it's basically the idea like when we\
[1:32:46](https://youtu.be/7gAwa9i-Vrw?t=5566) sleep you might be knowing like\
[1:32:48](https://youtu.be/7gAwa9i-Vrw?t=5568) our soul exits our body right yeah\
[1:32:51](https://youtu.be/7gAwa9i-Vrw?t=5571) so in the quran\
[1:33:06](https://youtu.be/7gAwa9i-Vrw?t=5586) so basically when we sleep our soul\
[1:33:09](https://youtu.be/7gAwa9i-Vrw?t=5589) exits our bodies so\
[1:33:10](https://youtu.be/7gAwa9i-Vrw?t=5590) the idea is like when you try to do\
[1:33:13](https://youtu.be/7gAwa9i-Vrw?t=5593) astral projection\
[1:33:15](https://youtu.be/7gAwa9i-Vrw?t=5595) you try to make your body sleep but you\

[1:33:25](https://youtu.be/7gAwa9i-Vrw?t=5605) and let your body sleep so so basically\
[1:33:28](https://youtu.be/7gAwa9i-Vrw?t=5608) what happens\
[1:33:29](https://youtu.be/7gAwa9i-Vrw?t=5609) when you when your soul exits your body\
[1:33:32](https://youtu.be/7gAwa9i-Vrw?t=5612) you can\
[1:33:33](https://youtu.be/7gAwa9i-Vrw?t=5613) you can be well aware like like how we\
[1:33:35](https://youtu.be/7gAwa9i-Vrw?t=5615) are away right now conscious right now\
[1:33:37](https://youtu.be/7gAwa9i-Vrw?t=5617) you can see everything you can see your\
[1:33:38](https://youtu.be/7gAwa9i-Vrw?t=5618) body you can see the soul leaving uh\

[1:34:15](https://youtu.be/7gAwa9i-Vrw?t=5655) uh i just i was just wondering is this\
[1:34:18](https://youtu.be/7gAwa9i-Vrw?t=5658) permissible\
[1:34:19](https://youtu.be/7gAwa9i-Vrw?t=5659) uh in islam like i don't know what it is\
[1:34:21](https://youtu.be/7gAwa9i-Vrw?t=5661) i can't i mean\
[1:34:22](https://youtu.be/7gAwa9i-Vrw?t=5662) there's three things\
[1:34:26](https://youtu.be/7gAwa9i-Vrw?t=5666) and he doesn't know where he is it's\
[1:34:29](https://youtu.be/7gAwa9i-Vrw?t=5669) compounded ignorance like the blind\
[1:34:31](https://youtu.be/7gAwa9i-Vrw?t=5671) leading the blind if i were to give you\
[1:34:32](https://youtu.be/7gAwa9i-Vrw?t=5672) an answer to that i would just\
[1:34:34](https://youtu.be/7gAwa9i-Vrw?t=5674) be catastrophic the blind not knowing\
[1:34:37](https://youtu.be/7gAwa9i-Vrw?t=5677) he's supposed to lead\
[1:34:38](https://youtu.be/7gAwa9i-Vrw?t=5678) yeah you know more than i do\
[1:34:42](https://youtu.be/7gAwa9i-Vrw?t=5682) i'll be honest i'll be honest with you\
[1:34:44](https://youtu.be/7gAwa9i-Vrw?t=5684) like i just tried it once\
[1:34:46](https://youtu.be/7gAwa9i-Vrw?t=5686) and i felt my soul like leaving the body\
[1:34:49](https://youtu.be/7gAwa9i-Vrw?t=5689) actually\
[1:34:50](https://youtu.be/7gAwa9i-Vrw?t=5690) and it was really like i would say be\
[1:34:52](https://youtu.be/7gAwa9i-Vrw?t=5692) careful with this stuff\
[1:34:54](https://youtu.be/7gAwa9i-Vrw?t=5694) i think i i'll tell you one time this\
[1:34:55](https://youtu.be/7gAwa9i-Vrw?t=5695) actually happened you know\
[1:34:57](https://youtu.be/7gAwa9i-Vrw?t=5697) it wasn't to me it was to my opponents\
[1:34:59](https://youtu.be/7gAwa9i-Vrw?t=5699) because when whenever i debate them the\
[1:35:01](https://youtu.be/7gAwa9i-Vrw?t=5701) soul leaves the body\
[1:35:03](https://youtu.be/7gAwa9i-Vrw?t=5703) you know they have astro projections\
[1:35:07](https://youtu.be/7gAwa9i-Vrw?t=5707) this is this is real brothers like you\
[1:35:10](https://youtu.be/7gAwa9i-Vrw?t=5710) wanna\
[1:35:10](https://youtu.be/7gAwa9i-Vrw?t=5710) um just add something like her brother\
[1:35:13](https://youtu.be/7gAwa9i-Vrw?t=5713) munich\
[1:35:14](https://youtu.be/7gAwa9i-Vrw?t=5714) says you just spoke about the opponents\
[1:35:16](https://youtu.be/7gAwa9i-Vrw?t=5716) and stuff that's good\
[1:35:17](https://youtu.be/7gAwa9i-Vrw?t=5717) you know uh this thing about the way you\
[1:35:20](https://youtu.be/7gAwa9i-Vrw?t=5720) look um\
[1:35:21](https://youtu.be/7gAwa9i-Vrw?t=5721) during debates and a lot of it a lot of\
[1:35:23](https://youtu.be/7gAwa9i-Vrw?t=5723) the communication is non-verbal\
[1:35:26](https://youtu.be/7gAwa9i-Vrw?t=5726) i don't know why but this image stuck in\
[1:35:28](https://youtu.be/7gAwa9i-Vrw?t=5728) my head\
[1:35:29](https://youtu.be/7gAwa9i-Vrw?t=5729) and the image was when you know during\
[1:35:32](https://youtu.be/7gAwa9i-Vrw?t=5732) the debate there was just one segment\
[1:35:33](https://youtu.be/7gAwa9i-Vrw?t=5733) because i was watching it live in\
[1:35:35](https://youtu.be/7gAwa9i-Vrw?t=5735) pakistan\
[1:35:36](https://youtu.be/7gAwa9i-Vrw?t=5736) and i'm not sure what time it was in\
[1:35:37](https://youtu.be/7gAwa9i-Vrw?t=5737) america but in pakistan it was after\
[1:35:38](https://youtu.be/7gAwa9i-Vrw?t=5738) fajr so i was watching it\
[1:35:39](https://youtu.be/7gAwa9i-Vrw?t=5739) live at fajr\
[1:35:42](https://youtu.be/7gAwa9i-Vrw?t=5742) and i was saying that and there's one\
[1:35:44](https://youtu.be/7gAwa9i-Vrw?t=5744) point\
[1:35:46](https://youtu.be/7gAwa9i-Vrw?t=5746) where i actually saw david woody and\
[1:35:50](https://youtu.be/7gAwa9i-Vrw?t=5750) he just looked really vulnerable like\
[1:35:53](https://youtu.be/7gAwa9i-Vrw?t=5753) i've never seen him\
[1:35:54](https://youtu.be/7gAwa9i-Vrw?t=5754) look like you know like i've always\
[1:35:57](https://youtu.be/7gAwa9i-Vrw?t=5757) looked at him and always felt like oh\
[1:35:58](https://youtu.be/7gAwa9i-Vrw?t=5758) this guy's an idiot he's this he's that\
[1:36:00](https://youtu.be/7gAwa9i-Vrw?t=5760) you feel like just just refuting him\
[1:36:03](https://youtu.be/7gAwa9i-Vrw?t=5763) but he actually it was almost like you\
[1:36:06](https://youtu.be/7gAwa9i-Vrw?t=5766) know\
[1:36:06](https://youtu.be/7gAwa9i-Vrw?t=5766) to the point where someone is so\
[1:36:09](https://youtu.be/7gAwa9i-Vrw?t=5769) humiliated\
[1:36:10](https://youtu.be/7gAwa9i-Vrw?t=5770) you actually start to feel empathy for\
[1:36:12](https://youtu.be/7gAwa9i-Vrw?t=5772) him now what happened with me and i i\
[1:36:15](https://youtu.be/7gAwa9i-Vrw?t=5775) it's a weird thing but somebody that you\
[1:36:17](https://youtu.be/7gAwa9i-Vrw?t=5777) see as\
[1:36:18](https://youtu.be/7gAwa9i-Vrw?t=5778) okay that's a strong opponent of islam\
[1:36:20](https://youtu.be/7gAwa9i-Vrw?t=5780) that's an islamophobia\
[1:36:22](https://youtu.be/7gAwa9i-Vrw?t=5782) it's a person that you see him in the\
[1:36:23](https://youtu.be/7gAwa9i-Vrw?t=5783) video he's got this smurf\
[1:36:25](https://youtu.be/7gAwa9i-Vrw?t=5785) you know what i'm talking about yeah\
[1:36:26](https://youtu.be/7gAwa9i-Vrw?t=5786) this constant smoke and he's got this\
[1:36:29](https://youtu.be/7gAwa9i-Vrw?t=5789) look and the camera angle in his face\
[1:36:31](https://youtu.be/7gAwa9i-Vrw?t=5791) and that point bro\
[1:36:33](https://youtu.be/7gAwa9i-Vrw?t=5793) it literally you know it reminded me it\
[1:36:35](https://youtu.be/7gAwa9i-Vrw?t=5795) reminded me\
[1:36:37](https://youtu.be/7gAwa9i-Vrw?t=5797) of you know i'm not sure how true this\
[1:36:39](https://youtu.be/7gAwa9i-Vrw?t=5799) is but\
[1:36:40](https://youtu.be/7gAwa9i-Vrw?t=5800) supposedly there's this idea that firon\
[1:36:42](https://youtu.be/7gAwa9i-Vrw?t=5802) he hated going to the toilet\
[1:36:44](https://youtu.be/7gAwa9i-Vrw?t=5804) i don't i don't know if you i've not\
[1:36:46](https://youtu.be/7gAwa9i-Vrw?t=5806) read it but the reason was because it\
[1:36:48](https://youtu.be/7gAwa9i-Vrw?t=5808) showed his humanity\
[1:36:49](https://youtu.be/7gAwa9i-Vrw?t=5809) yeah so he hated going to the toilet\
[1:36:51](https://youtu.be/7gAwa9i-Vrw?t=5811) because it was kind of like\
[1:36:52](https://youtu.be/7gAwa9i-Vrw?t=5812) he's supposed to be a god he's supposed\
[1:36:54](https://youtu.be/7gAwa9i-Vrw?t=5814) to be great and he's he's going and he's\
[1:36:57](https://youtu.be/7gAwa9i-Vrw?t=5817) uh going to a toilet right so so you\
[1:36:59](https://youtu.be/7gAwa9i-Vrw?t=5819) know\
[1:37:00](https://youtu.be/7gAwa9i-Vrw?t=5820) that image is now ingrained in my brain\
[1:37:03](https://youtu.be/7gAwa9i-Vrw?t=5823) with the image where he's so vulnerable\
[1:37:05](https://youtu.be/7gAwa9i-Vrw?t=5825) i feel sorry for him\
[1:37:07](https://youtu.be/7gAwa9i-Vrw?t=5827) so now i have these mixed feelings yeah\
[1:37:09](https://youtu.be/7gAwa9i-Vrw?t=5829) so i have this\
[1:37:10](https://youtu.be/7gAwa9i-Vrw?t=5830) now after that when i saw that debate\
[1:37:12](https://youtu.be/7gAwa9i-Vrw?t=5832) and\
[1:37:13](https://youtu.be/7gAwa9i-Vrw?t=5833) and the aftermath and everything i just\
[1:37:15](https://youtu.be/7gAwa9i-Vrw?t=5835) thought to myself do you know what\
[1:37:16](https://youtu.be/7gAwa9i-Vrw?t=5836) that's it he's finished now when he went\
[1:37:19](https://youtu.be/7gAwa9i-Vrw?t=5839) back\
[1:37:20](https://youtu.be/7gAwa9i-Vrw?t=5840) he looked like conor mcgregor yeah yeah\
[1:37:22](https://youtu.be/7gAwa9i-Vrw?t=5842) yeah he made the same quality videos\
[1:37:24](https://youtu.be/7gAwa9i-Vrw?t=5844) with the same confidence\
[1:37:26](https://youtu.be/7gAwa9i-Vrw?t=5846) and i was like that just reminds me of\
[1:37:28](https://youtu.be/7gAwa9i-Vrw?t=5848) you know in school\
[1:37:29](https://youtu.be/7gAwa9i-Vrw?t=5849) somebody gets buoyed they get bullied\
[1:37:31](https://youtu.be/7gAwa9i-Vrw?t=5851) like somebody just bullies them\
[1:37:33](https://youtu.be/7gAwa9i-Vrw?t=5853) in front of everybody yeah the next day\
[1:37:35](https://youtu.be/7gAwa9i-Vrw?t=5855) they pretend to be hard again it's like\
[1:37:36](https://youtu.be/7gAwa9i-Vrw?t=5856) no no that's gone now that \[ \_\_ ] that\
[1:37:38](https://youtu.be/7gAwa9i-Vrw?t=5858) that boat's gone now and that ship\
[1:37:41](https://youtu.be/7gAwa9i-Vrw?t=5861) sailed basically\
[1:37:42](https://youtu.be/7gAwa9i-Vrw?t=5862) but i don't know if you've if you felt\
[1:37:44](https://youtu.be/7gAwa9i-Vrw?t=5864) that because i had this weird feeling\
[1:37:46](https://youtu.be/7gAwa9i-Vrw?t=5866) during the debate that that's it\
[1:37:47](https://youtu.be/7gAwa9i-Vrw?t=5867) i felt the same thing with you and aaron\
[1:37:49](https://youtu.be/7gAwa9i-Vrw?t=5869) actually when you had his debate when he\
[1:37:50](https://youtu.be/7gAwa9i-Vrw?t=5870) came back and he saw you and speaking\
[1:37:52](https://youtu.be/7gAwa9i-Vrw?t=5872) he didn't seem like he wanted to be\
[1:37:54](https://youtu.be/7gAwa9i-Vrw?t=5874) there like he saw one night he's like\
[1:37:55](https://youtu.be/7gAwa9i-Vrw?t=5875) you know it's like he saw\
[1:37:56](https://youtu.be/7gAwa9i-Vrw?t=5876) it's like the school bully has come he's\
[1:37:59](https://youtu.be/7gAwa9i-Vrw?t=5879) just not he's not interested and now\
[1:38:01](https://youtu.be/7gAwa9i-Vrw?t=5881) look at his\
[1:38:02](https://youtu.be/7gAwa9i-Vrw?t=5882) look at him goes back to confidence\
[1:38:04](https://youtu.be/7gAwa9i-Vrw?t=5884) where is he now what's he doing with\
[1:38:05](https://youtu.be/7gAwa9i-Vrw?t=5885) himself\
[1:38:07](https://youtu.be/7gAwa9i-Vrw?t=5887) after that i don't think he's where is\
[1:38:08](https://youtu.be/7gAwa9i-Vrw?t=5888) he what's he doing no but\
[1:38:10](https://youtu.be/7gAwa9i-Vrw?t=5890) i do find this i think it's the sam\
[1:38:12](https://youtu.be/7gAwa9i-Vrw?t=5892) harris has the same issue\
[1:38:13](https://youtu.be/7gAwa9i-Vrw?t=5893) he lost the debate to the point that\
[1:38:17](https://youtu.be/7gAwa9i-Vrw?t=5897) there's no point carrying on yeah he\
[1:38:18](https://youtu.be/7gAwa9i-Vrw?t=5898) retired but he now makes videos\
[1:38:20](https://youtu.be/7gAwa9i-Vrw?t=5900) as if nothing happened the thing is once\
[1:38:23](https://youtu.be/7gAwa9i-Vrw?t=5903) you've done\
[1:38:24](https://youtu.be/7gAwa9i-Vrw?t=5904) something like that i think that i would\
[1:38:27](https://youtu.be/7gAwa9i-Vrw?t=5907) respect somebody who simply says do you\
[1:38:29](https://youtu.be/7gAwa9i-Vrw?t=5909) know what all right\
[1:38:30](https://youtu.be/7gAwa9i-Vrw?t=5910) hats off i'm gonna go become a janitor\
[1:38:33](https://youtu.be/7gAwa9i-Vrw?t=5913) like i'd respect that person more than\
[1:38:34](https://youtu.be/7gAwa9i-Vrw?t=5914) somebody who\
[1:38:35](https://youtu.be/7gAwa9i-Vrw?t=5915) pretends nothing happened and they just\
[1:38:37](https://youtu.be/7gAwa9i-Vrw?t=5917) pretend also one of my\
[1:38:39](https://youtu.be/7gAwa9i-Vrw?t=5919) uh uh one of my thoughts on this is this\
[1:38:41](https://youtu.be/7gAwa9i-Vrw?t=5921) is pure\
[1:38:43](https://youtu.be/7gAwa9i-Vrw?t=5923) like you your ego is so big\
[1:38:46](https://youtu.be/7gAwa9i-Vrw?t=5926) you know we're talking about astral\
[1:38:47](https://youtu.be/7gAwa9i-Vrw?t=5927) projection yeah your ego\
[1:38:49](https://youtu.be/7gAwa9i-Vrw?t=5929) is so big you don't realize what just\
[1:38:52](https://youtu.be/7gAwa9i-Vrw?t=5932) happens here\
[1:38:53](https://youtu.be/7gAwa9i-Vrw?t=5933) i i actually feel but he might be my\
[1:38:56](https://youtu.be/7gAwa9i-Vrw?t=5936) fault colin\
[1:38:57](https://youtu.be/7gAwa9i-Vrw?t=5937) this david wood because uh i mean\
[1:38:59](https://youtu.be/7gAwa9i-Vrw?t=5939) independently lifted from him\
[1:39:01](https://youtu.be/7gAwa9i-Vrw?t=5941) like he made a video he's talking about\
[1:39:02](https://youtu.be/7gAwa9i-Vrw?t=5942) his mom and brother dying or something\
[1:39:04](https://youtu.be/7gAwa9i-Vrw?t=5944) and he said it with no emotion\
[1:39:06](https://youtu.be/7gAwa9i-Vrw?t=5946) and seriously if you're if you're going\
[1:39:08](https://youtu.be/7gAwa9i-Vrw?t=5948) to do that i am\
[1:39:10](https://youtu.be/7gAwa9i-Vrw?t=5950) actually going to suspect he said he's a\
[1:39:11](https://youtu.be/7gAwa9i-Vrw?t=5951) psychopath but he might be psychotic\
[1:39:14](https://youtu.be/7gAwa9i-Vrw?t=5954) actually as well he might have he might\
[1:39:15](https://youtu.be/7gAwa9i-Vrw?t=5955) be insane he might be clinically insane\
[1:39:18](https://youtu.be/7gAwa9i-Vrw?t=5958) and for for all intents and probably if\
[1:39:20](https://youtu.be/7gAwa9i-Vrw?t=5960) he's insane is\
[1:39:21](https://youtu.be/7gAwa9i-Vrw?t=5961) my fault it could be this well you know\
[1:39:24](https://youtu.be/7gAwa9i-Vrw?t=5964) the strange thing is not\
[1:39:26](https://youtu.be/7gAwa9i-Vrw?t=5966) that he's just insane or or these types\
[1:39:29](https://youtu.be/7gAwa9i-Vrw?t=5969) of things i mean that's obvious i mean\
[1:39:30](https://youtu.be/7gAwa9i-Vrw?t=5970) anybody who you know\
[1:39:32](https://youtu.be/7gAwa9i-Vrw?t=5972) what i love about him this is why i\
[1:39:33](https://youtu.be/7gAwa9i-Vrw?t=5973) actually really like him yeah\
[1:39:35](https://youtu.be/7gAwa9i-Vrw?t=5975) is that these christians they work so\
[1:39:37](https://youtu.be/7gAwa9i-Vrw?t=5977) hard to build a narrative\
[1:39:39](https://youtu.be/7gAwa9i-Vrw?t=5979) of jesus's love it's all about love our\
[1:39:42](https://youtu.be/7gAwa9i-Vrw?t=5982) religions love crusades has nothing to\
[1:39:44](https://youtu.be/7gAwa9i-Vrw?t=5984) do with us\
[1:39:45](https://youtu.be/7gAwa9i-Vrw?t=5985) you know we're all about love they go to\
[1:39:46](https://youtu.be/7gAwa9i-Vrw?t=5986) muslim countries they go to other\
[1:39:48](https://youtu.be/7gAwa9i-Vrw?t=5988) countries\
[1:39:49](https://youtu.be/7gAwa9i-Vrw?t=5989) they try and just talk they build up\
[1:39:51](https://youtu.be/7gAwa9i-Vrw?t=5991) this amazing narrative of\
[1:39:53](https://youtu.be/7gAwa9i-Vrw?t=5993) jesus and rainbows in unicorns and\
[1:39:56](https://youtu.be/7gAwa9i-Vrw?t=5996) safety and then in comes along a man\
[1:39:58](https://youtu.be/7gAwa9i-Vrw?t=5998) with a sledgehammer eating food yeah and\
[1:40:01](https://youtu.be/7gAwa9i-Vrw?t=6001) he just\
[1:40:01](https://youtu.be/7gAwa9i-Vrw?t=6001) he just he thinks he's hurting yeah and\
[1:40:04](https://youtu.be/7gAwa9i-Vrw?t=6004) he smashes their narrative\
[1:40:06](https://youtu.be/7gAwa9i-Vrw?t=6006) bro you know\

[1:43:55](https://youtu.be/7gAwa9i-Vrw?t=6235) for like having us um so i wrote down my\
[1:43:58](https://youtu.be/7gAwa9i-Vrw?t=6238) question so it could be brief and other\
[1:44:00](https://youtu.be/7gAwa9i-Vrw?t=6240) people could like ask questions\
[1:44:02](https://youtu.be/7gAwa9i-Vrw?t=6242) um i'll just like read it out really\
[1:44:03](https://youtu.be/7gAwa9i-Vrw?t=6243) quickly so it's about like the\
[1:44:06](https://youtu.be/7gAwa9i-Vrw?t=6246) contingency argument so i found your\
[1:44:09](https://youtu.be/7gAwa9i-Vrw?t=6249) comments on\
[1:44:10](https://youtu.be/7gAwa9i-Vrw?t=6250) kalam very interesting and the\
[1:44:11](https://youtu.be/7gAwa9i-Vrw?t=6251) discussion in your book and in the quran\
[1:44:13](https://youtu.be/7gAwa9i-Vrw?t=6253) about multiple deities and how this is\
[1:44:15](https://youtu.be/7gAwa9i-Vrw?t=6255) not possible as they would like\
[1:44:17](https://youtu.be/7gAwa9i-Vrw?t=6257) outstrip each other and that they would\
[1:44:19](https://youtu.be/7gAwa9i-Vrw?t=6259) have uh to be defined against each other\
[1:44:22](https://youtu.be/7gAwa9i-Vrw?t=6262) so like to quote um i believe the\
[1:44:24](https://youtu.be/7gAwa9i-Vrw?t=6264) conclusion of your book\
[1:44:26](https://youtu.be/7gAwa9i-Vrw?t=6266) uh quote there cannot be more than uh\
[1:44:28](https://youtu.be/7gAwa9i-Vrw?t=6268) one such\
[1:44:29](https://youtu.be/7gAwa9i-Vrw?t=6269) a being since it would entail that at\
[1:44:31](https://youtu.be/7gAwa9i-Vrw?t=6271) least one of these beings is\
[1:44:32](https://youtu.be/7gAwa9i-Vrw?t=6272) differentiated possible or dependent\
[1:44:35](https://youtu.be/7gAwa9i-Vrw?t=6275) uh to practice i'm only asking this\
[1:44:37](https://youtu.be/7gAwa9i-Vrw?t=6277) question like to see like what logically\
[1:44:39](https://youtu.be/7gAwa9i-Vrw?t=6279) follows from like the argument\
[1:44:41](https://youtu.be/7gAwa9i-Vrw?t=6281) this isn't like any like doubt or\
[1:44:42](https://youtu.be/7gAwa9i-Vrw?t=6282) anything like that i have\
[1:44:44](https://youtu.be/7gAwa9i-Vrw?t=6284) so two questions based upon this right\
[1:44:46](https://youtu.be/7gAwa9i-Vrw?t=6286) why doesn't the instantiation of\
[1:44:48](https://youtu.be/7gAwa9i-Vrw?t=6288) dependent objects limit the necessary\
[1:44:50](https://youtu.be/7gAwa9i-Vrw?t=6290) existence in question\
[1:44:52](https://youtu.be/7gAwa9i-Vrw?t=6292) so why like how would you how would you\
[1:44:54](https://youtu.be/7gAwa9i-Vrw?t=6294) argue that like in\
[1:44:55](https://youtu.be/7gAwa9i-Vrw?t=6295) instantiation of an independent um like\
[1:44:59](https://youtu.be/7gAwa9i-Vrw?t=6299) uh existence uh creates a\
[1:45:01](https://youtu.be/7gAwa9i-Vrw?t=6301) differentiation between like the two\
[1:45:03](https://youtu.be/7gAwa9i-Vrw?t=6303) exists existences if that makes any\
[1:45:05](https://youtu.be/7gAwa9i-Vrw?t=6305) sense and then second of all\
[1:45:07](https://youtu.be/7gAwa9i-Vrw?t=6307) this is um kind of related uh not\
[1:45:09](https://youtu.be/7gAwa9i-Vrw?t=6309) directly related\
[1:45:10](https://youtu.be/7gAwa9i-Vrw?t=6310) but would moral restrictions restrict\
[1:45:12](https://youtu.be/7gAwa9i-Vrw?t=6312) the independence omnipotence\
[1:45:14](https://youtu.be/7gAwa9i-Vrw?t=6314) so like if allah has a moral code that\
[1:45:17](https://youtu.be/7gAwa9i-Vrw?t=6317) uh he follows\
[1:45:18](https://youtu.be/7gAwa9i-Vrw?t=6318) is that um a hindrance to omnipotence\
[1:45:22](https://youtu.be/7gAwa9i-Vrw?t=6322) let's start with the first question\
[1:45:23](https://youtu.be/7gAwa9i-Vrw?t=6323) first i think there might have been a\
[1:45:25](https://youtu.be/7gAwa9i-Vrw?t=6325) bit of a confusion between\
[1:45:27](https://youtu.be/7gAwa9i-Vrw?t=6327) uh deleted temeno which is what you're\
[1:45:29](https://youtu.be/7gAwa9i-Vrw?t=6329) referring to which is that they would\
[1:45:30](https://youtu.be/7gAwa9i-Vrw?t=6330) outstrip one another\
[1:45:32](https://youtu.be/7gAwa9i-Vrw?t=6332) that's in reference to chapter number 23\
[1:45:34](https://youtu.be/7gAwa9i-Vrw?t=6334) verse 91 where it says\
[1:45:43](https://youtu.be/7gAwa9i-Vrw?t=6343) that allah did not take a son and he\
[1:45:46](https://youtu.be/7gAwa9i-Vrw?t=6346) didn't have with him any\
[1:45:47](https://youtu.be/7gAwa9i-Vrw?t=6347) god had this been the case they would\
[1:45:49](https://youtu.be/7gAwa9i-Vrw?t=6349) have outstripped one another\
[1:45:52](https://youtu.be/7gAwa9i-Vrw?t=6352) and this is what the people of kalam or\
[1:45:56](https://youtu.be/7gAwa9i-Vrw?t=6356) whoever it may be theologian systematic\
[1:45:58](https://youtu.be/7gAwa9i-Vrw?t=6358) theologians of the muslim world refer to\
[1:46:00](https://youtu.be/7gAwa9i-Vrw?t=6360) the leader tamannaah which means\
[1:46:03](https://youtu.be/7gAwa9i-Vrw?t=6363) the mena is basically\
[1:46:07](https://youtu.be/7gAwa9i-Vrw?t=6367) something is a preventive something\
[1:46:09](https://youtu.be/7gAwa9i-Vrw?t=6369) which prevents something else\
[1:46:10](https://youtu.be/7gAwa9i-Vrw?t=6370) so tamannaah is the preventive the\
[1:46:14](https://youtu.be/7gAwa9i-Vrw?t=6374) the evidence of prevention okay so\
[1:46:18](https://youtu.be/7gAwa9i-Vrw?t=6378) what is prevented here the what is\
[1:46:20](https://youtu.be/7gAwa9i-Vrw?t=6380) prevented of\
[1:46:21](https://youtu.be/7gAwa9i-Vrw?t=6381) in this verse that you can't have two\
[1:46:23](https://youtu.be/7gAwa9i-Vrw?t=6383) all-powerful\
[1:46:25](https://youtu.be/7gAwa9i-Vrw?t=6385) deities you can't have two or powerful\
[1:46:28](https://youtu.be/7gAwa9i-Vrw?t=6388) entities because by ex by necessity\
[1:46:31](https://youtu.be/7gAwa9i-Vrw?t=6391) this would mean to say that one of them\
[1:46:35](https://youtu.be/7gAwa9i-Vrw?t=6395) is you can't be the most powerful\
[1:46:38](https://youtu.be/7gAwa9i-Vrw?t=6398) if there's another one of you who is of\
[1:46:41](https://youtu.be/7gAwa9i-Vrw?t=6401) equal power\
[1:46:42](https://youtu.be/7gAwa9i-Vrw?t=6402) because that would mean to say that you\
[1:46:44](https://youtu.be/7gAwa9i-Vrw?t=6404) are more powerful and\
[1:46:45](https://youtu.be/7gAwa9i-Vrw?t=6405) equally powerful to that other entity at\
[1:46:48](https://youtu.be/7gAwa9i-Vrw?t=6408) the same time\
[1:46:49](https://youtu.be/7gAwa9i-Vrw?t=6409) as you get this point if there's more\
[1:46:50](https://youtu.be/7gAwa9i-Vrw?t=6410) than so if the postulation is\
[1:46:53](https://youtu.be/7gAwa9i-Vrw?t=6413) that there are two all-powerful agencies\
[1:46:56](https://youtu.be/7gAwa9i-Vrw?t=6416) so if we say all powerful what do you\
[1:46:57](https://youtu.be/7gAwa9i-Vrw?t=6417) mean by that the most powerful\
[1:46:59](https://youtu.be/7gAwa9i-Vrw?t=6419) then what we're saying is you can't have\
[1:47:01](https://youtu.be/7gAwa9i-Vrw?t=6421) something which is the most powerful\
[1:47:04](https://youtu.be/7gAwa9i-Vrw?t=6424) which is what we say god is the most\
[1:47:06](https://youtu.be/7gAwa9i-Vrw?t=6426) powerful yet\
[1:47:07](https://youtu.be/7gAwa9i-Vrw?t=6427) equally uh powerful to another entity at\
[1:47:10](https://youtu.be/7gAwa9i-Vrw?t=6430) the same time\
[1:47:11](https://youtu.be/7gAwa9i-Vrw?t=6431) because you can't be equally and more at\
[1:47:13](https://youtu.be/7gAwa9i-Vrw?t=6433) the same time\
[1:47:14](https://youtu.be/7gAwa9i-Vrw?t=6434) most like implies one thing right right\
[1:47:17](https://youtu.be/7gAwa9i-Vrw?t=6437) right good\
[1:47:17](https://youtu.be/7gAwa9i-Vrw?t=6437) so that's that's right you can't have\
[1:47:20](https://youtu.be/7gAwa9i-Vrw?t=6440) two\
[1:47:21](https://youtu.be/7gAwa9i-Vrw?t=6441) all-powerful things which are more\
[1:47:23](https://youtu.be/7gAwa9i-Vrw?t=6443) powerful than all things that exist\
[1:47:24](https://youtu.be/7gAwa9i-Vrw?t=6444) because if that is the case\
[1:47:25](https://youtu.be/7gAwa9i-Vrw?t=6445) then they will be more most powerful uh\
[1:47:29](https://youtu.be/7gAwa9i-Vrw?t=6449) there would be more powerful than the\
[1:47:30](https://youtu.be/7gAwa9i-Vrw?t=6450) other one and equally as powerful than\
[1:47:32](https://youtu.be/7gAwa9i-Vrw?t=6452) the other one\
[1:47:33](https://youtu.be/7gAwa9i-Vrw?t=6453) which is by the way on this point all of\
[1:47:36](https://youtu.be/7gAwa9i-Vrw?t=6456) these\
[1:47:36](https://youtu.be/7gAwa9i-Vrw?t=6456) deviant sex in islam and it's not all\
[1:47:40](https://youtu.be/7gAwa9i-Vrw?t=6460) like for example to sharia\
[1:47:41](https://youtu.be/7gAwa9i-Vrw?t=6461) the shii sect right not all of them say\
[1:47:44](https://youtu.be/7gAwa9i-Vrw?t=6464) this but there are definitely some 12s\
[1:47:46](https://youtu.be/7gAwa9i-Vrw?t=6466) who say that\
[1:47:47](https://youtu.be/7gAwa9i-Vrw?t=6467) ali has the same knowledge as god for\
[1:47:50](https://youtu.be/7gAwa9i-Vrw?t=6470) example\
[1:47:52](https://youtu.be/7gAwa9i-Vrw?t=6472) yeah he said he has the same knowledge\
[1:47:54](https://youtu.be/7gAwa9i-Vrw?t=6474) as god and they have\
[1:47:56](https://youtu.be/7gAwa9i-Vrw?t=6476) uh chapter headings of the kafi book\
[1:47:58](https://youtu.be/7gAwa9i-Vrw?t=6478) saying that he knows all the things that\
[1:48:00](https://youtu.be/7gAwa9i-Vrw?t=6480) come from the sky and blah blah blah\
[1:48:02](https://youtu.be/7gAwa9i-Vrw?t=6482) and they will make an argument saying\
[1:48:04](https://youtu.be/7gAwa9i-Vrw?t=6484) that the only thing\
[1:48:06](https://youtu.be/7gAwa9i-Vrw?t=6486) why this is acceptable is because allah\
[1:48:08](https://youtu.be/7gAwa9i-Vrw?t=6488) has given him the permission\
[1:48:10](https://youtu.be/7gAwa9i-Vrw?t=6490) all right and this is not something\
[1:48:11](https://youtu.be/7gAwa9i-Vrw?t=6491) which is i'm sorry to say\
[1:48:13](https://youtu.be/7gAwa9i-Vrw?t=6493) exclusive to the shiites there are some\
[1:48:15](https://youtu.be/7gAwa9i-Vrw?t=6495) sufis who i've heard say this\
[1:48:17](https://youtu.be/7gAwa9i-Vrw?t=6497) myself i've heard them say this that\
[1:48:19](https://youtu.be/7gAwa9i-Vrw?t=6499) muhammad sallallahu alaihi\
[1:48:20](https://youtu.be/7gAwa9i-Vrw?t=6500) knows everything that exists\
[1:48:23](https://youtu.be/7gAwa9i-Vrw?t=6503) even the quran says\
[1:48:29](https://youtu.be/7gAwa9i-Vrw?t=6509) and this some say no muhammad knows\
[1:48:31](https://youtu.be/7gAwa9i-Vrw?t=6511) everything and in fact not only he knows\
[1:48:33](https://youtu.be/7gAwa9i-Vrw?t=6513) it but he can hear everything and\
[1:48:35](https://youtu.be/7gAwa9i-Vrw?t=6515) therefore we can\
[1:48:37](https://youtu.be/7gAwa9i-Vrw?t=6517) invoke him directly because he can hear\
[1:48:39](https://youtu.be/7gAwa9i-Vrw?t=6519) everything this is\
[1:48:41](https://youtu.be/7gAwa9i-Vrw?t=6521) there's no way that you can believe that\
[1:48:43](https://youtu.be/7gAwa9i-Vrw?t=6523) and remain to be muslim\
[1:48:45](https://youtu.be/7gAwa9i-Vrw?t=6525) because how can you be first of all it's\
[1:48:47](https://youtu.be/7gAwa9i-Vrw?t=6527) logically impossible\
[1:48:49](https://youtu.be/7gAwa9i-Vrw?t=6529) a is logically impossible because you're\
[1:48:51](https://youtu.be/7gAwa9i-Vrw?t=6531) saying now that allah has\
[1:48:53](https://youtu.be/7gAwa9i-Vrw?t=6533) there's another entity which is meant to\
[1:48:55](https://youtu.be/7gAwa9i-Vrw?t=6535) be as\
[1:48:56](https://youtu.be/7gAwa9i-Vrw?t=6536) powerful and less powerful than\
[1:48:59](https://youtu.be/7gAwa9i-Vrw?t=6539) god or as knowledgeable and less\
[1:49:02](https://youtu.be/7gAwa9i-Vrw?t=6542) knowledgeable than god\
[1:49:03](https://youtu.be/7gAwa9i-Vrw?t=6543) or as he uh has the same ability to hear\
[1:49:07](https://youtu.be/7gAwa9i-Vrw?t=6547) has less ability to hear and more\
[1:49:10](https://youtu.be/7gAwa9i-Vrw?t=6550) the same ability to say as god if any\
[1:49:13](https://youtu.be/7gAwa9i-Vrw?t=6553) muslims believe that that's a nullifier\
[1:49:14](https://youtu.be/7gAwa9i-Vrw?t=6554) of islam\
[1:49:16](https://youtu.be/7gAwa9i-Vrw?t=6556) this is very important because it's not\
[1:49:17](https://youtu.be/7gAwa9i-Vrw?t=6557) just something which yeah in this verse\
[1:49:19](https://youtu.be/7gAwa9i-Vrw?t=6559) some\
[1:49:20](https://youtu.be/7gAwa9i-Vrw?t=6560) muslims call themselves muslims believe\
[1:49:22](https://youtu.be/7gAwa9i-Vrw?t=6562) in it i've heard them\
[1:49:23](https://youtu.be/7gAwa9i-Vrw?t=6563) my own two is i've had discussions of\
[1:49:26](https://youtu.be/7gAwa9i-Vrw?t=6566) talab from the shiite people and they\
[1:49:29](https://youtu.be/7gAwa9i-Vrw?t=6569) say we believe al hussein\
[1:49:31](https://youtu.be/7gAwa9i-Vrw?t=6571) knows everything that he knew\
[1:49:34](https://youtu.be/7gAwa9i-Vrw?t=6574) when he was going into karbala when he\
[1:49:36](https://youtu.be/7gAwa9i-Vrw?t=6576) was going into the war that he\
[1:49:37](https://youtu.be/7gAwa9i-Vrw?t=6577) would get killed and he went there doing\
[1:49:39](https://youtu.be/7gAwa9i-Vrw?t=6579) suicide mission he knew that yeah i mean\
[1:49:42](https://youtu.be/7gAwa9i-Vrw?t=6582) he knows everything this is\
[1:49:43](https://youtu.be/7gAwa9i-Vrw?t=6583) this is no different from christianity\
[1:49:45](https://youtu.be/7gAwa9i-Vrw?t=6585) we have to appreciate this\
[1:49:47](https://youtu.be/7gAwa9i-Vrw?t=6587) this is no different believing in that\
[1:49:50](https://youtu.be/7gAwa9i-Vrw?t=6590) there's no difference between believing\
[1:49:52](https://youtu.be/7gAwa9i-Vrw?t=6592) in that and believing in jesus\
[1:49:54](https://youtu.be/7gAwa9i-Vrw?t=6594) who also has similar abilities so we put\
[1:49:56](https://youtu.be/7gAwa9i-Vrw?t=6596) them in the same campus christians\
[1:49:58](https://youtu.be/7gAwa9i-Vrw?t=6598) those individuals who vehemently like\
[1:50:00](https://youtu.be/7gAwa9i-Vrw?t=6600) believe in that without\
[1:50:01](https://youtu.be/7gAwa9i-Vrw?t=6601) obviously not might take fear of them\
[1:50:03](https://youtu.be/7gAwa9i-Vrw?t=6603) will say you know this is what the quran\
[1:50:04](https://youtu.be/7gAwa9i-Vrw?t=6604) says this is why it's logically\
[1:50:05](https://youtu.be/7gAwa9i-Vrw?t=6605) impossible\
[1:50:06](https://youtu.be/7gAwa9i-Vrw?t=6606) but that is another fire islam i know\
[1:50:08](https://youtu.be/7gAwa9i-Vrw?t=6608) this i just went on a tangent here\
[1:50:10](https://youtu.be/7gAwa9i-Vrw?t=6610) sorry to say but that's\
[1:50:13](https://youtu.be/7gAwa9i-Vrw?t=6613) which is the preventative uh\
[1:50:18](https://youtu.be/7gAwa9i-Vrw?t=6618) oh the the the evidence of prevention or\
[1:50:20](https://youtu.be/7gAwa9i-Vrw?t=6620) you i'll try i'll think of a way to\
[1:50:22](https://youtu.be/7gAwa9i-Vrw?t=6622) to to translate that maybe or look at\
[1:50:24](https://youtu.be/7gAwa9i-Vrw?t=6624) what the literature already has\
[1:50:26](https://youtu.be/7gAwa9i-Vrw?t=6626) but the what i was making in the book is\
[1:50:28](https://youtu.be/7gAwa9i-Vrw?t=6628) not the leader by the way\
[1:50:30](https://youtu.be/7gAwa9i-Vrw?t=6630) this what i was making in the book was\
[1:50:33](https://youtu.be/7gAwa9i-Vrw?t=6633) uh\
[1:50:33](https://youtu.be/7gAwa9i-Vrw?t=6633) the evidence that you can't have more\
[1:50:35](https://youtu.be/7gAwa9i-Vrw?t=6635) than one necessary existence\
[1:50:37](https://youtu.be/7gAwa9i-Vrw?t=6637) now why can't you have more than one\
[1:50:39](https://youtu.be/7gAwa9i-Vrw?t=6639) necessary existence if a necessary one\
[1:50:41](https://youtu.be/7gAwa9i-Vrw?t=6641) of the definitions of a necessary\
[1:50:43](https://youtu.be/7gAwa9i-Vrw?t=6643) existence\
[1:50:43](https://youtu.be/7gAwa9i-Vrw?t=6643) is something which cannot be any other\
[1:50:45](https://youtu.be/7gAwa9i-Vrw?t=6645) way so if there's two of them\
[1:50:47](https://youtu.be/7gAwa9i-Vrw?t=6647) there's two options okay there's two\
[1:50:49](https://youtu.be/7gAwa9i-Vrw?t=6649) options i want you to think about this\
[1:50:50](https://youtu.be/7gAwa9i-Vrw?t=6650) yeah\
[1:50:51](https://youtu.be/7gAwa9i-Vrw?t=6651) option one that that thing\
[1:50:54](https://youtu.be/7gAwa9i-Vrw?t=6654) is described in exactly the same let's\
[1:50:56](https://youtu.be/7gAwa9i-Vrw?t=6656) call it\
[1:50:58](https://youtu.be/7gAwa9i-Vrw?t=6658) necessary existence a for the sake of\
[1:51:00](https://youtu.be/7gAwa9i-Vrw?t=6660) argument and you have necessary\
[1:51:01](https://youtu.be/7gAwa9i-Vrw?t=6661) existence b\
[1:51:02](https://youtu.be/7gAwa9i-Vrw?t=6662) are you with me oh yeah i'm writing\
[1:51:05](https://youtu.be/7gAwa9i-Vrw?t=6665) everything down so\
[1:51:06](https://youtu.be/7gAwa9i-Vrw?t=6666) we'll tell you if you agree you have\
[1:51:08](https://youtu.be/7gAwa9i-Vrw?t=6668) necessary existence a\
[1:51:10](https://youtu.be/7gAwa9i-Vrw?t=6670) and you have necessary existence b\
[1:51:12](https://youtu.be/7gAwa9i-Vrw?t=6672) necessary existence a\
[1:51:14](https://youtu.be/7gAwa9i-Vrw?t=6674) is described as having\
[1:51:17](https://youtu.be/7gAwa9i-Vrw?t=6677) necessary qualities yeah which cannot be\
[1:51:20](https://youtu.be/7gAwa9i-Vrw?t=6680) any other way\
[1:51:21](https://youtu.be/7gAwa9i-Vrw?t=6681) which means that these qualities are you\
[1:51:24](https://youtu.be/7gAwa9i-Vrw?t=6684) cannot add subtract rearrange\
[1:51:26](https://youtu.be/7gAwa9i-Vrw?t=6686) it's that way and it cannot be in your\
[1:51:28](https://youtu.be/7gAwa9i-Vrw?t=6688) way yes\
[1:51:30](https://youtu.be/7gAwa9i-Vrw?t=6690) now if we say necessary distance b is\
[1:51:34](https://youtu.be/7gAwa9i-Vrw?t=6694) the same\
[1:51:35](https://youtu.be/7gAwa9i-Vrw?t=6695) but has one difference okay which is\
[1:51:38](https://youtu.be/7gAwa9i-Vrw?t=6698) that for example necessary existence b\
[1:51:42](https://youtu.be/7gAwa9i-Vrw?t=6702) has the difference of let's say\
[1:51:46](https://youtu.be/7gAwa9i-Vrw?t=6706) one quality quality x are you with me\
[1:51:49](https://youtu.be/7gAwa9i-Vrw?t=6709) yeah okay so if we differentiate\
[1:51:53](https://youtu.be/7gAwa9i-Vrw?t=6713) necessary resistance b from next to\
[1:51:54](https://youtu.be/7gAwa9i-Vrw?t=6714) existence a\
[1:51:56](https://youtu.be/7gAwa9i-Vrw?t=6716) because net existence b yes\
[1:51:59](https://youtu.be/7gAwa9i-Vrw?t=6719) has quality x which is different then by\
[1:52:02](https://youtu.be/7gAwa9i-Vrw?t=6722) definition\
[1:52:03](https://youtu.be/7gAwa9i-Vrw?t=6723) necessary distance b is not necessary\
[1:52:05](https://youtu.be/7gAwa9i-Vrw?t=6725) but it's contingent\
[1:52:07](https://youtu.be/7gAwa9i-Vrw?t=6727) because a contingent existence is\
[1:52:08](https://youtu.be/7gAwa9i-Vrw?t=6728) something which can be something\
[1:52:10](https://youtu.be/7gAwa9i-Vrw?t=6730) uh another way if you differentiate\
[1:52:12](https://youtu.be/7gAwa9i-Vrw?t=6732) necessary distance a from b\
[1:52:14](https://youtu.be/7gAwa9i-Vrw?t=6734) then you've already rendered necessary\
[1:52:16](https://youtu.be/7gAwa9i-Vrw?t=6736) resistance b for any\
[1:52:18](https://youtu.be/7gAwa9i-Vrw?t=6738) differentiating reason then you've\
[1:52:20](https://youtu.be/7gAwa9i-Vrw?t=6740) already rendered\
[1:52:21](https://youtu.be/7gAwa9i-Vrw?t=6741) necessary existence b as contingent\
[1:52:24](https://youtu.be/7gAwa9i-Vrw?t=6744) because a contingent thing is something\
[1:52:26](https://youtu.be/7gAwa9i-Vrw?t=6746) which can be any other way\
[1:52:28](https://youtu.be/7gAwa9i-Vrw?t=6748) and since you're saying there's a\
[1:52:29](https://youtu.be/7gAwa9i-Vrw?t=6749) variable which can be rearranged\
[1:52:31](https://youtu.be/7gAwa9i-Vrw?t=6751) in order to differentiate a from b then\
[1:52:34](https://youtu.be/7gAwa9i-Vrw?t=6754) that variable by definition must make\
[1:52:37](https://youtu.be/7gAwa9i-Vrw?t=6757) necessary distance b into a into a\
[1:52:39](https://youtu.be/7gAwa9i-Vrw?t=6759) contingent\
[1:52:40](https://youtu.be/7gAwa9i-Vrw?t=6760) existence rather than switches now one\
[1:52:43](https://youtu.be/7gAwa9i-Vrw?t=6763) point okay\
[1:52:44](https://youtu.be/7gAwa9i-Vrw?t=6764) so go ahead first go ahead so um one\
[1:52:46](https://youtu.be/7gAwa9i-Vrw?t=6766) question so you're\
[1:52:47](https://youtu.be/7gAwa9i-Vrw?t=6767) would you see okay so you're saying that\
[1:52:50](https://youtu.be/7gAwa9i-Vrw?t=6770) there's one variable that means\
[1:52:52](https://youtu.be/7gAwa9i-Vrw?t=6772) uh because there's a variable that means\
[1:52:55](https://youtu.be/7gAwa9i-Vrw?t=6775) it follows that it is contingent because\
[1:52:57](https://youtu.be/7gAwa9i-Vrw?t=6777) that means\
[1:52:58](https://youtu.be/7gAwa9i-Vrw?t=6778) that like that existence could be some\
[1:53:00](https://youtu.be/7gAwa9i-Vrw?t=6780) other way which is\
[1:53:01](https://youtu.be/7gAwa9i-Vrw?t=6781) in negation unnecessary right what\
[1:53:03](https://youtu.be/7gAwa9i-Vrw?t=6783) pushed in before\
[1:53:04](https://youtu.be/7gAwa9i-Vrw?t=6784) uh one question before what about like\
[1:53:07](https://youtu.be/7gAwa9i-Vrw?t=6787) free will of like the entity that would\
[1:53:08](https://youtu.be/7gAwa9i-Vrw?t=6788) not come\
[1:53:09](https://youtu.be/7gAwa9i-Vrw?t=6789) under like this argument because like we\
[1:53:12](https://youtu.be/7gAwa9i-Vrw?t=6792) believe allah and necessary existence\
[1:53:14](https://youtu.be/7gAwa9i-Vrw?t=6794) allah has free will right so you could\
[1:53:15](https://youtu.be/7gAwa9i-Vrw?t=6795) do one thing could do another thing\
[1:53:17](https://youtu.be/7gAwa9i-Vrw?t=6797) right\
[1:53:18](https://youtu.be/7gAwa9i-Vrw?t=6798) so uh wouldn't like we're saying that\
[1:53:21](https://youtu.be/7gAwa9i-Vrw?t=6801) properties or qualities that you say\
[1:53:23](https://youtu.be/7gAwa9i-Vrw?t=6803) quality x um\
[1:53:25](https://youtu.be/7gAwa9i-Vrw?t=6805) is different from like free will itself\
[1:53:27](https://youtu.be/7gAwa9i-Vrw?t=6807) is equality\
[1:53:28](https://youtu.be/7gAwa9i-Vrw?t=6808) but what like the necessary existence\
[1:53:31](https://youtu.be/7gAwa9i-Vrw?t=6811) does with the free will\
[1:53:32](https://youtu.be/7gAwa9i-Vrw?t=6812) is not equality right i don't know if\
[1:53:35](https://youtu.be/7gAwa9i-Vrw?t=6815) that made any sense but\
[1:53:36](https://youtu.be/7gAwa9i-Vrw?t=6816) i think i know what you're trying to say\
[1:53:37](https://youtu.be/7gAwa9i-Vrw?t=6817) look volition or will here\
[1:53:40](https://youtu.be/7gAwa9i-Vrw?t=6820) now we're going into a different\
[1:53:41](https://youtu.be/7gAwa9i-Vrw?t=6821) discussion as to what the necessary\
[1:53:43](https://youtu.be/7gAwa9i-Vrw?t=6823) existence\
[1:53:44](https://youtu.be/7gAwa9i-Vrw?t=6824) does now we're not talking this\
[1:53:46](https://youtu.be/7gAwa9i-Vrw?t=6826) discussion is not focused on\
[1:53:48](https://youtu.be/7gAwa9i-Vrw?t=6828) or verbs we're talking about what and\
[1:53:51](https://youtu.be/7gAwa9i-Vrw?t=6831) is we're not talking about what they do\
[1:53:53](https://youtu.be/7gAwa9i-Vrw?t=6833) right we're talking about it\
[1:53:55](https://youtu.be/7gAwa9i-Vrw?t=6835) right right so this is only focused on\
[1:53:57](https://youtu.be/7gAwa9i-Vrw?t=6837) intrinsic attributes\
[1:53:58](https://youtu.be/7gAwa9i-Vrw?t=6838) okay okay all right so that's the other\
[1:54:01](https://youtu.be/7gAwa9i-Vrw?t=6841) option is to say that necessary\
[1:54:03](https://youtu.be/7gAwa9i-Vrw?t=6843) existence a and necessarily\
[1:54:05](https://youtu.be/7gAwa9i-Vrw?t=6845) there is no differentiation yeah there's\
[1:54:08](https://youtu.be/7gAwa9i-Vrw?t=6848) nothing to differentiate a and b\
[1:54:10](https://youtu.be/7gAwa9i-Vrw?t=6850) okay we don't have this issue we don't\
[1:54:12](https://youtu.be/7gAwa9i-Vrw?t=6852) have this issue now according now\
[1:54:13](https://youtu.be/7gAwa9i-Vrw?t=6853) on this logic we don't have this issue\
[1:54:15](https://youtu.be/7gAwa9i-Vrw?t=6855) right of\
[1:54:17](https://youtu.be/7gAwa9i-Vrw?t=6857) necessary existence b having a quality x\
[1:54:20](https://youtu.be/7gAwa9i-Vrw?t=6860) say to differentiate it from this\
[1:54:22](https://youtu.be/7gAwa9i-Vrw?t=6862) existence uh\
[1:54:23](https://youtu.be/7gAwa9i-Vrw?t=6863) a yeah but if we say that necessary\
[1:54:26](https://youtu.be/7gAwa9i-Vrw?t=6866) distance a\
[1:54:28](https://youtu.be/7gAwa9i-Vrw?t=6868) is the same in terms of how how we\
[1:54:30](https://youtu.be/7gAwa9i-Vrw?t=6870) define it\
[1:54:31](https://youtu.be/7gAwa9i-Vrw?t=6871) as x is b that's resistance b it's the\
[1:54:33](https://youtu.be/7gAwa9i-Vrw?t=6873) equivalent of saying a equals a which is\
[1:54:35](https://youtu.be/7gAwa9i-Vrw?t=6875) the totality which means that both of\
[1:54:37](https://youtu.be/7gAwa9i-Vrw?t=6877) the same thing\
[1:54:38](https://youtu.be/7gAwa9i-Vrw?t=6878) exactly okay there is actually no\
[1:54:40](https://youtu.be/7gAwa9i-Vrw?t=6880) difference between necessarily\
[1:54:41](https://youtu.be/7gAwa9i-Vrw?t=6881) a and b in that case we we we have\
[1:54:44](https://youtu.be/7gAwa9i-Vrw?t=6884) solved the issue\
[1:54:45](https://youtu.be/7gAwa9i-Vrw?t=6885) these are the exhaustive ways you can\
[1:54:47](https://youtu.be/7gAwa9i-Vrw?t=6887) deal with this situation okay yeah\
[1:54:48](https://youtu.be/7gAwa9i-Vrw?t=6888) okay um i was going towards like a\
[1:54:51](https://youtu.be/7gAwa9i-Vrw?t=6891) similar track thank you\
[1:54:52](https://youtu.be/7gAwa9i-Vrw?t=6892) like uh by making it clear um\
[1:54:55](https://youtu.be/7gAwa9i-Vrw?t=6895) uh do you uh would you be able to answer\
[1:54:58](https://youtu.be/7gAwa9i-Vrw?t=6898) like the second part of the question uh\
[1:54:59](https://youtu.be/7gAwa9i-Vrw?t=6899) would moral restrictions restrict the\
[1:55:01](https://youtu.be/7gAwa9i-Vrw?t=6901) independent like being\
[1:55:02](https://youtu.be/7gAwa9i-Vrw?t=6902) omnipotent like being like omni like\
[1:55:05](https://youtu.be/7gAwa9i-Vrw?t=6905) having like complete mercy and like uh\
[1:55:08](https://youtu.be/7gAwa9i-Vrw?t=6908) omnipotence like\
[1:55:09](https://youtu.be/7gAwa9i-Vrw?t=6909) how are they not contradictory so so so\
[1:55:12](https://youtu.be/7gAwa9i-Vrw?t=6912) basically say that again that lost while\
[1:55:14](https://youtu.be/7gAwa9i-Vrw?t=6914) the christian story\
[1:55:15](https://youtu.be/7gAwa9i-Vrw?t=6915) having infinite mercy and having\
[1:55:17](https://youtu.be/7gAwa9i-Vrw?t=6917) omnipotence how are they not\
[1:55:18](https://youtu.be/7gAwa9i-Vrw?t=6918) contradictory\
[1:55:20](https://youtu.be/7gAwa9i-Vrw?t=6920) why would they be sorry why would they\
[1:55:23](https://youtu.be/7gAwa9i-Vrw?t=6923) like um\
[1:55:24](https://youtu.be/7gAwa9i-Vrw?t=6924) for us allah cannot do like allah cannot\
[1:55:27](https://youtu.be/7gAwa9i-Vrw?t=6927) be evil right\
[1:55:28](https://youtu.be/7gAwa9i-Vrw?t=6928) so like um omnipotence means that like\
[1:55:30](https://youtu.be/7gAwa9i-Vrw?t=6930) you can do all things right\
[1:55:32](https://youtu.be/7gAwa9i-Vrw?t=6932) if i please correct me if i'm like\
[1:55:34](https://youtu.be/7gAwa9i-Vrw?t=6934) saying anything wrong right\
[1:55:35](https://youtu.be/7gAwa9i-Vrw?t=6935) uh but um yeah omnipotence means that\
[1:55:37](https://youtu.be/7gAwa9i-Vrw?t=6937) you're like\
[1:55:38](https://youtu.be/7gAwa9i-Vrw?t=6938) yeah okay so so allah allah\
[1:55:43](https://youtu.be/7gAwa9i-Vrw?t=6943) that allah is over all things powerful\
[1:55:46](https://youtu.be/7gAwa9i-Vrw?t=6946) exists to the category of\
[1:55:48](https://youtu.be/7gAwa9i-Vrw?t=6948) existence which is possible existences\
[1:55:51](https://youtu.be/7gAwa9i-Vrw?t=6951) so in other words when we say this\
[1:55:55](https://youtu.be/7gAwa9i-Vrw?t=6955) comes out of that is the things which\
[1:55:57](https://youtu.be/7gAwa9i-Vrw?t=6957) don't exist for example\
[1:55:59](https://youtu.be/7gAwa9i-Vrw?t=6959) uh contradictions or square circles or\
[1:56:00](https://youtu.be/7gAwa9i-Vrw?t=6960) whatever because that doesn't exist\
[1:56:02](https://youtu.be/7gAwa9i-Vrw?t=6962) they're not things\
[1:56:02](https://youtu.be/7gAwa9i-Vrw?t=6962) okay okay that's that's an important um\
[1:56:06](https://youtu.be/7gAwa9i-Vrw?t=6966) point so go ahead okay yeah so um\
[1:56:09](https://youtu.be/7gAwa9i-Vrw?t=6969) would you so would that mean like uh\
[1:56:13](https://youtu.be/7gAwa9i-Vrw?t=6973) would that mean that uh like saying that\
[1:56:16](https://youtu.be/7gAwa9i-Vrw?t=6976) like um under omnipotence under our\
[1:56:19](https://youtu.be/7gAwa9i-Vrw?t=6979) definition of omnipotence only things\
[1:56:22](https://youtu.be/7gAwa9i-Vrw?t=6982) that\
[1:56:22](https://youtu.be/7gAwa9i-Vrw?t=6982) are like merciful can like happen right\
[1:56:25](https://youtu.be/7gAwa9i-Vrw?t=6985) like would that like what\
[1:56:28](https://youtu.be/7gAwa9i-Vrw?t=6988) that's like my question is basically\
[1:56:30](https://youtu.be/7gAwa9i-Vrw?t=6990) omnipotence means that like\
[1:56:32](https://youtu.be/7gAwa9i-Vrw?t=6992) the necessary existing existence can do\
[1:56:35](https://youtu.be/7gAwa9i-Vrw?t=6995) all things right\
[1:56:36](https://youtu.be/7gAwa9i-Vrw?t=6996) if you believe in like all merciful like\
[1:56:39](https://youtu.be/7gAwa9i-Vrw?t=6999) necessary existence\
[1:56:40](https://youtu.be/7gAwa9i-Vrw?t=7000) then by definition it means that that\
[1:56:42](https://youtu.be/7gAwa9i-Vrw?t=7002) necessary existence\
[1:56:44](https://youtu.be/7gAwa9i-Vrw?t=7004) cannot do evil things so how is that not\
[1:56:46](https://youtu.be/7gAwa9i-Vrw?t=7006) a contradiction\
[1:56:47](https://youtu.be/7gAwa9i-Vrw?t=7007) okay so uh then first of all there's two\
[1:56:50](https://youtu.be/7gAwa9i-Vrw?t=7010) things here\
[1:56:51](https://youtu.be/7gAwa9i-Vrw?t=7011) i'll tell you you've been taking his\
[1:56:52](https://youtu.be/7gAwa9i-Vrw?t=7012) opinion on this he had a theology\
[1:56:55](https://youtu.be/7gAwa9i-Vrw?t=7015) telling me i didn't believe the evil\
[1:56:56](https://youtu.be/7gAwa9i-Vrw?t=7016) existed in the real world\
[1:56:58](https://youtu.be/7gAwa9i-Vrw?t=7018) which is a very interesting position by\
[1:57:00](https://youtu.be/7gAwa9i-Vrw?t=7020) the way he said that evil is only\
[1:57:03](https://youtu.be/7gAwa9i-Vrw?t=7023) nisby and this was the opinion of him\
[1:57:05](https://youtu.be/7gAwa9i-Vrw?t=7025) i'm actually trying to gravitate towards\
[1:57:07](https://youtu.be/7gAwa9i-Vrw?t=7027) this position\
[1:57:09](https://youtu.be/7gAwa9i-Vrw?t=7029) qualifications can you define the last\
[1:57:12](https://youtu.be/7gAwa9i-Vrw?t=7032) word you said\
[1:57:15](https://youtu.be/7gAwa9i-Vrw?t=7035) that evil is only relative oh relative\
[1:57:19](https://youtu.be/7gAwa9i-Vrw?t=7039) okay\
[1:57:19](https://youtu.be/7gAwa9i-Vrw?t=7039) yeah so let me give an example right let\
[1:57:21](https://youtu.be/7gAwa9i-Vrw?t=7041) me give you let me play devil's advocate\
[1:57:25](https://youtu.be/7gAwa9i-Vrw?t=7045) and god steal\
[1:57:29](https://youtu.be/7gAwa9i-Vrw?t=7049) um everything is his so no there you\
[1:57:32](https://youtu.be/7gAwa9i-Vrw?t=7052) have it so\
[1:57:33](https://youtu.be/7gAwa9i-Vrw?t=7053) because but can i steal yeah\
[1:57:37](https://youtu.be/7gAwa9i-Vrw?t=7057) oh yeah you can always be graphic can\
[1:57:41](https://youtu.be/7gAwa9i-Vrw?t=7061) god rape um i mean no\
[1:57:45](https://youtu.be/7gAwa9i-Vrw?t=7065) because like no no good\
[1:57:50](https://youtu.be/7gAwa9i-Vrw?t=7070) because there's no such thing it's the\
[1:57:52](https://youtu.be/7gAwa9i-Vrw?t=7072) same one\
[1:57:53](https://youtu.be/7gAwa9i-Vrw?t=7073) you would use for steel it just has\
[1:57:54](https://youtu.be/7gAwa9i-Vrw?t=7074) different connotations\
[1:57:56](https://youtu.be/7gAwa9i-Vrw?t=7076) the point is uh these evil actions that\
[1:58:00](https://youtu.be/7gAwa9i-Vrw?t=7080) we're doing\
[1:58:01](https://youtu.be/7gAwa9i-Vrw?t=7081) on this on this view right are only evil\
[1:58:03](https://youtu.be/7gAwa9i-Vrw?t=7083) because\
[1:58:04](https://youtu.be/7gAwa9i-Vrw?t=7084) we interact with the world in a certain\
[1:58:06](https://youtu.be/7gAwa9i-Vrw?t=7086) way which make\
[1:58:08](https://youtu.be/7gAwa9i-Vrw?t=7088) that it's a relative evilness okay\
[1:58:11](https://youtu.be/7gAwa9i-Vrw?t=7091) it's a relative evilness which means\
[1:58:12](https://youtu.be/7gAwa9i-Vrw?t=7092) that my interaction with x\
[1:58:14](https://youtu.be/7gAwa9i-Vrw?t=7094) is such that i am evil because of what\
[1:58:17](https://youtu.be/7gAwa9i-Vrw?t=7097) i'm doing\
[1:58:17](https://youtu.be/7gAwa9i-Vrw?t=7097) my actions are evil now this\
[1:58:21](https://youtu.be/7gAwa9i-Vrw?t=7101) allah has created our actions this is a\
[1:58:24](https://youtu.be/7gAwa9i-Vrw?t=7104) very important point by the way\
[1:58:26](https://youtu.be/7gAwa9i-Vrw?t=7106) and i take his view on this so i'm just\
[1:58:27](https://youtu.be/7gAwa9i-Vrw?t=7107) going to give you all i take the view on\
[1:58:30](https://youtu.be/7gAwa9i-Vrw?t=7110) ibrahim says this allah doesn't do our\
[1:58:33](https://youtu.be/7gAwa9i-Vrw?t=7113) actions\
[1:58:34](https://youtu.be/7gAwa9i-Vrw?t=7114) yeah and i think he's the best\
[1:58:36](https://youtu.be/7gAwa9i-Vrw?t=7116) contributor of this in the islamic\
[1:58:38](https://youtu.be/7gAwa9i-Vrw?t=7118) discourse\
[1:58:42](https://youtu.be/7gAwa9i-Vrw?t=7122) that allah doesn't do what we do\
[1:58:46](https://youtu.be/7gAwa9i-Vrw?t=7126) he doesn't do it i do what i do\
[1:58:49](https://youtu.be/7gAwa9i-Vrw?t=7129) allah because here's the issue right\
[1:58:52](https://youtu.be/7gAwa9i-Vrw?t=7132) some people think it's something which\
[1:58:55](https://youtu.be/7gAwa9i-Vrw?t=7135) is uh against and this is the\
[1:58:57](https://youtu.be/7gAwa9i-Vrw?t=7137) position of the calvinists and the\
[1:58:58](https://youtu.be/7gAwa9i-Vrw?t=7138) reformed tradition yeah\
[1:59:00](https://youtu.be/7gAwa9i-Vrw?t=7140) yeah anything against the sovereignty of\
[1:59:02](https://youtu.be/7gAwa9i-Vrw?t=7142) god\
[1:59:03](https://youtu.be/7gAwa9i-Vrw?t=7143) that i may act within my own uh or i may\
[1:59:07](https://youtu.be/7gAwa9i-Vrw?t=7147) have education efficacious action or\
[1:59:10](https://youtu.be/7gAwa9i-Vrw?t=7150) action which is efficacious\
[1:59:12](https://youtu.be/7gAwa9i-Vrw?t=7152) or volition or will of my own aside from\
[1:59:14](https://youtu.be/7gAwa9i-Vrw?t=7154) the will of god\
[1:59:16](https://youtu.be/7gAwa9i-Vrw?t=7156) are you with me yes yeah so our\
[1:59:19](https://youtu.be/7gAwa9i-Vrw?t=7159) we say this and this is i think the best\
[1:59:21](https://youtu.be/7gAwa9i-Vrw?t=7161) answer to the question from all schools\
[1:59:23](https://youtu.be/7gAwa9i-Vrw?t=7163) of law\
[1:59:25](https://youtu.be/7gAwa9i-Vrw?t=7165) that i've read and i've read all of them\
[1:59:26](https://youtu.be/7gAwa9i-Vrw?t=7166) like modernism\
[1:59:28](https://youtu.be/7gAwa9i-Vrw?t=7168) uh calvinism um armenianism\
[1:59:31](https://youtu.be/7gAwa9i-Vrw?t=7171) um uh ashadism um\
[1:59:34](https://youtu.be/7gAwa9i-Vrw?t=7174) and within usheism the different flavors\
[1:59:37](https://youtu.be/7gAwa9i-Vrw?t=7177) and and then they replay him and i think\
[1:59:38](https://youtu.be/7gAwa9i-Vrw?t=7178) for me ibukim was the best okay he says\
[1:59:42](https://youtu.be/7gAwa9i-Vrw?t=7182) this\
[1:59:44](https://youtu.be/7gAwa9i-Vrw?t=7184) human being human being doesn't do his\
[1:59:47](https://youtu.be/7gAwa9i-Vrw?t=7187) own actions\
[1:59:49](https://youtu.be/7gAwa9i-Vrw?t=7189) okay allah sorry sorry allah doesn't do\
[1:59:53](https://youtu.be/7gAwa9i-Vrw?t=7193) human beings actions\
[1:59:54](https://youtu.be/7gAwa9i-Vrw?t=7194) right human being does his own actions\
[1:59:59](https://youtu.be/7gAwa9i-Vrw?t=7199) but the the relationship of omnipotence\
[2:00:03](https://youtu.be/7gAwa9i-Vrw?t=7203) that allah has with our actions is a\
[2:00:06](https://youtu.be/7gAwa9i-Vrw?t=7206) creative relationship\
[2:00:08](https://youtu.be/7gAwa9i-Vrw?t=7208) so in other words allah creates our\
[2:00:10](https://youtu.be/7gAwa9i-Vrw?t=7210) actions\
[2:00:21](https://youtu.be/7gAwa9i-Vrw?t=7221) this is how to preserve the omnipotence\
[2:00:23](https://youtu.be/7gAwa9i-Vrw?t=7223) and the sovereignty of god\
[2:00:25](https://youtu.be/7gAwa9i-Vrw?t=7225) that allah's actions\
[2:00:29](https://youtu.be/7gAwa9i-Vrw?t=7229) are not our actions they're not\
[2:00:30](https://youtu.be/7gAwa9i-Vrw?t=7230) synonymous if you say that they are then\
[2:00:32](https://youtu.be/7gAwa9i-Vrw?t=7232) we have no free will\
[2:00:33](https://youtu.be/7gAwa9i-Vrw?t=7233) it's gone there's no free will we're\
[2:00:36](https://youtu.be/7gAwa9i-Vrw?t=7236) puppets\
[2:00:37](https://youtu.be/7gAwa9i-Vrw?t=7237) go back to jabri uh\
[2:00:45](https://youtu.be/7gAwa9i-Vrw?t=7245) we are in control of the health we are\
[2:00:47](https://youtu.be/7gAwa9i-Vrw?t=7247) sorry in control of our own actions\
[2:00:49](https://youtu.be/7gAwa9i-Vrw?t=7249) but allah has created us and therefore\
[2:00:51](https://youtu.be/7gAwa9i-Vrw?t=7251) indirectly created what\
[2:00:52](https://youtu.be/7gAwa9i-Vrw?t=7252) our so the the way to preserve the\
[2:00:56](https://youtu.be/7gAwa9i-Vrw?t=7256) omnipotence of god\
[2:00:58](https://youtu.be/7gAwa9i-Vrw?t=7258) is through a creative relationship\
[2:01:01](https://youtu.be/7gAwa9i-Vrw?t=7261) not through a verbal doing relationship\
[2:01:05](https://youtu.be/7gAwa9i-Vrw?t=7265) so this is my position number one\
[2:01:08](https://youtu.be/7gAwa9i-Vrw?t=7268) first and foremost we're saying evil is\
[2:01:10](https://youtu.be/7gAwa9i-Vrw?t=7270) nisbi evil\
[2:01:11](https://youtu.be/7gAwa9i-Vrw?t=7271) or or evil is relative to the doer\
[2:01:16](https://youtu.be/7gAwa9i-Vrw?t=7276) it's subject relative okay and in the\
[2:01:19](https://youtu.be/7gAwa9i-Vrw?t=7279) case of the human being\
[2:01:20](https://youtu.be/7gAwa9i-Vrw?t=7280) it's relative to the human being are you\
[2:01:22](https://youtu.be/7gAwa9i-Vrw?t=7282) with me so far yeah\
[2:01:24](https://youtu.be/7gAwa9i-Vrw?t=7284) so can god can god commit shirk\
[2:01:27](https://youtu.be/7gAwa9i-Vrw?t=7287) no this makes no sense it's impossible\
[2:01:31](https://youtu.be/7gAwa9i-Vrw?t=7291) this uh sorry to say this this this big\
[2:01:34](https://youtu.be/7gAwa9i-Vrw?t=7294) debate that the maturities are having\
[2:01:35](https://youtu.be/7gAwa9i-Vrw?t=7295) with the ashari's\
[2:01:37](https://youtu.be/7gAwa9i-Vrw?t=7297) about can god lie how can how can\
[2:01:41](https://youtu.be/7gAwa9i-Vrw?t=7301) something which is all\
[2:01:43](https://youtu.be/7gAwa9i-Vrw?t=7303) true lie actually if god is\
[2:01:46](https://youtu.be/7gAwa9i-Vrw?t=7306) a lie would be upset it's like it's now\
[2:01:50](https://youtu.be/7gAwa9i-Vrw?t=7310) yeah so this is the answer to the\
[2:01:52](https://youtu.be/7gAwa9i-Vrw?t=7312) question god cannot lie\
[2:01:54](https://youtu.be/7gAwa9i-Vrw?t=7314) because that's mohal okay so so what\
[2:01:56](https://youtu.be/7gAwa9i-Vrw?t=7316) we're saying is\
[2:01:57](https://youtu.be/7gAwa9i-Vrw?t=7317) sorry i'm going into deviance i'm going\
[2:01:58](https://youtu.be/7gAwa9i-Vrw?t=7318) in\
[2:02:00](https://youtu.be/7gAwa9i-Vrw?t=7320) i'm going to take it the point is this\
[2:02:03](https://youtu.be/7gAwa9i-Vrw?t=7323) sorry\
[2:02:05](https://youtu.be/7gAwa9i-Vrw?t=7325) what was the question i said why are you\
[2:02:07](https://youtu.be/7gAwa9i-Vrw?t=7327) doing that yeah infinite mostly infinite\
[2:02:08](https://youtu.be/7gAwa9i-Vrw?t=7328) power\
[2:02:09](https://youtu.be/7gAwa9i-Vrw?t=7329) just so so sorry the evil argument\
[2:02:14](https://youtu.be/7gAwa9i-Vrw?t=7334) from the from this theo theodicy\
[2:02:16](https://youtu.be/7gAwa9i-Vrw?t=7336) paradigm\
[2:02:17](https://youtu.be/7gAwa9i-Vrw?t=7337) we say the following god's infinite\
[2:02:20](https://youtu.be/7gAwa9i-Vrw?t=7340) power\
[2:02:20](https://youtu.be/7gAwa9i-Vrw?t=7340) is not jeopardized therefore\
[2:02:24](https://youtu.be/7gAwa9i-Vrw?t=7344) by creating creatures with volition that\
[2:02:26](https://youtu.be/7gAwa9i-Vrw?t=7346) have actions of their own\
[2:02:28](https://youtu.be/7gAwa9i-Vrw?t=7348) which which have an indirect creative\
[2:02:30](https://youtu.be/7gAwa9i-Vrw?t=7350) relationship with allah\
[2:02:33](https://youtu.be/7gAwa9i-Vrw?t=7353) because he has that indirect creative\
[2:02:35](https://youtu.be/7gAwa9i-Vrw?t=7355) relationship with it\
[2:02:37](https://youtu.be/7gAwa9i-Vrw?t=7357) so we maintain the omnipotence of god\
[2:02:40](https://youtu.be/7gAwa9i-Vrw?t=7360) but at the same time we what we maintain\
[2:02:43](https://youtu.be/7gAwa9i-Vrw?t=7363) the\
[2:02:44](https://youtu.be/7gAwa9i-Vrw?t=7364) the mercy paradigm or the uh the wisdom\
[2:02:46](https://youtu.be/7gAwa9i-Vrw?t=7366) paradigm or the goodness of god paradigm\
[2:02:48](https://youtu.be/7gAwa9i-Vrw?t=7368) all that stuff\
[2:02:49](https://youtu.be/7gAwa9i-Vrw?t=7369) okay this is true this is this is an\
[2:02:52](https://youtu.be/7gAwa9i-Vrw?t=7372) area where we have to tread carefully\
[2:02:53](https://youtu.be/7gAwa9i-Vrw?t=7373) because many different people have\
[2:02:54](https://youtu.be/7gAwa9i-Vrw?t=7374) different\
[2:02:55](https://youtu.be/7gAwa9i-Vrw?t=7375) opinions but i'm just outlining to you\
[2:02:57](https://youtu.be/7gAwa9i-Vrw?t=7377) what my opinion is\
[2:02:58](https://youtu.be/7gAwa9i-Vrw?t=7378) sure and that's and that's what it is\
[2:03:00](https://youtu.be/7gAwa9i-Vrw?t=7380) okay so uh\
